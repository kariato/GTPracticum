      "4314 2770 Investors are asking hard questions, and not always getting the answers they want. Using mark-to-market methods, a company calculates the fair market value of a commodity position - whether it's a contract, an option, a swap, etc. - at the time, even if the value of the position is realized over a longer period. The problem with this method is the actual cash a company realizes from the position might not be the same value the company calculated in its original assessment. Also, sometimes it isn't easy to calculate the fair value of the commodity position. This is particularly true in instances where the market for the commodity isn't liquid. Over time, companies with the highest level of disclosure regarding their mark-to-market gains will most likely trade at higher multiples to counterparts that provide little or no disclosure, said ABN AMRO Inc. analyst Paul Patterson. Encouragingly, it appears companies may already be responding to the call for added disclosure. According to a survey Patterson conducted, more companies with energy trading units were willing to disclose the details of their mark-to-market accounting practices during third-quarter conference calls compared with those in the second quarter. Patterson said he prefers earnings that are cash-based. \"All things being equal, we believe reported earnings that more closely reflect the timely realization of cash have a higher quality associated with them than earnings that do not,\" he said. He expects investors to become smarter and learn to distinguish between earnings growth through accrual accounting and growth fueled by mark-to-market accounting. At the end of the day, it is not a matter of simply producing profits, but being able to say where those earnings came from, said one investor, who manages a pension fund. Some investors also may be placing a greater emphasis on the cash flow the energy merchants produce. Tim O'Brien, portfolio manager of the Gabelli Utilities Fund, said energy merchants that own the physical power assets to back up their trading positions should trade at a premium to an independent power producers and traditional utility companies. Still, the stocks should be valued at less than the growth rate of the company because of their heavy exposures to commodity prices. Energy merchants include companies such as Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) and Dominion Resources Inc. (D). According to O'Brien, the group never deserved to have the price-to-earnings multiples above 20- to 30-times earnings, which were once paid for the stocks. \"We all got sucked up by the up-leg of the cycle and forgot just how cyclical these companies are,\" O'Brien said, adding that the average multiple should be in the high single-digits to the high-teens.\n",

      "4187 2643 Subject: The first detailed allegations that Enronabused mark-to-market accounting tohide wholesale trading losses haveemerged in congressional testimony pro-videdby a professor and former deriva-tivestrader who reviewed the Enron casefor Senate Governmental Affairs Com-mittee.Those charges, along with allega-tionsthat have surfaced that mark-to-marketaccounting was misused by EnronEnergy Services, the company's retailenergy and services unit, are expected tosupport the push by accounting rulemak-ersfor much more disclosure on mark-to-marketaccounting practices and theimpact of mark-to-market accounting onearnings trading firms' earnings.In testimony Thursday before theSenate Governmental Affairs Committeelast week, Frank Partnoy of the Universi-tyof San Diego Law School, said itappears that Enron traders mismarkedforward curves and manipulated theamount of profits and losses that wouldbe reported in financial statements.\"In a nutshell, it appears that someEnron employees used dummy accountsand rigged valuation methodologies to cre-atefalse profit-and-loss entries for the deriv-ativesEnron traded,\" said Partnoy, whoreviewed the case over several weeks at thecommittee's request. \"It appears that Enrontraders selectively mismarked their forwardcurves, typically in order to hide losses.\"\"Traders are compensated based ontheir profits,\" he observed, \"so if a tradercan hide losses by mismarking forwardcurves, he or she is likely to receive alarger bonus.\"Partnoy said mismarking forwardcurves was not the only problem.\"For each trade,\" he testified, \"atrader would report either a profit or loss,typically in spreadsheet format. Theseprofit-and-loss reports were designed toreflect economic reality. Frequently theydid not. Instead of recording the entireprofit for a trade in one column, sometraders reportedly split the profit from atrade into two columns. The first columnreflected the portion of the actual profitsthe trader intended to add to Enron's cur-rentfinancial statements.

But where there is no such market, companies were allowed by the =rules to use their own models to estimate fair value, and to treat that as =the market value.=20The mark-to-market technique was used to report profits in some Enron busin=esses. When its energy services unit signed a power-supply contract with a =company, it would structure the deal to bring it under those accounting rul=es. It would then project electricity and natural gas prices for the full t=erm of the deal, which could last as long as 10 years, according to former =Enron officials.=20Many of the contracts covered companies in states that had not yet deregula=ted their power markets. In those cases, Enron forecast when the states wou=ld deregulate those markets and then projected what prices would be under t=he currently nonexistent deregulated market.=20Then, based on its projections, Enron would calculate its total profit over= the life of the contract. After discounting that figure to account for the= risk its customer would default and the fact that it would not receive mos=t payments for years, Enron would book the profit immediately.=20Mr. Lucas said it had not occurred to him that anyone would use models to t=ry to forecast energy prices for 10 years, and then use those models to rep=ort profits, but that the rule had not placed a limit on such trades. He no=ted that any trade that required assumptions for such a long time would app=ear to be very risky.=20A former Enron official has told associates that Arthur Andersen, Enron's a=uditor, took a number of issues related to Enron's accounting to the task f=orce.

But at the heart of the situation is an accounting technique that allows companies to include as current earnings those profits they expect to realize from energy-related contracts and other derivative instruments in future periods, sometimes stretching over more than 20 years. So-called mark-to-market accounting is mandated by accounting-rule makers when companies have outstanding energy-related contracts on their books at the end of a quarter, such as agreements to sell electricity or buy natural gas over a period of time at certain prices. Under those rules, companies estimate the fair market values of those contracts on their balance sheets each quarter as assets or liabilities. Changes in the value of a contract from quarter to quarter then are either added to or subtracted from net earnings. If, for instance, the market price for natural gas rises above the price specified in a company's contract to buy gas, generally the company will record an unrealized gain. That gain is recognized as income and recorded as an asset on the company's balance sheet. At the end of each quarter, the contract is revalued. The value of the previously recorded asset is increased, and any increase in unrealized gain is recorded as additional income. Conversely, if the market value for gas falls, and the value of the contract has declined, any change in the contract's value is recorded on the company's balance sheet, and a loss is recorded on its income statement. e Yet in their financial reports, the companies only vaguely describe the methods they use to come up with fair-value estimates on the contracts. Increasingly, quoted market prices offering independent guidance are becoming readily available for several years into the future. However, with some long-term derivative instruments, particularly electricity contracts, future market prices don't extend far enough to cover the full life of those contracts. And in those cases, companies are allowed to base valuations on their own undisclosed estimates, assumptions and pricing models. \"Ultimately they're telling you what they think the answer is, but they're not telling you how they got to that answer,\" says Stephen Campbell, an analyst at Business Valuation Services in Dallas. \"That is essentially saying `trust me.'\"\n",

Not only is the article relevant because it apparently caused the stock to dip by $10, but the article elaborates on concerns that apply to a form of accounting that some of our commercial people would like to have apply to our business.

DF---------------------- Forwarded by Drew Fossum/ET&S/Enron on 09/25/2000 ET & S Business Intelligence DepartmentSubject: The Press Behind the Stock Dip?TEXAS JOURNALEnergy Traders Cite Gains, But Some Math Is MissingBy Jonathan WeilStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal09/20/2000The Wall Street JournalTexas JournalT1(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)Volatile prices for natural gas and electricity are creating high-voltage earnings growth at some companies with large energy-trading units. But investors counting on these gains could be in for a jolt down the road. Shares of these companies have been on a tear lately. And some of the biggest players are in Houston, the center of the energy-trading industry. Dynegy Inc.'s stock is up more than fourfold so far this year at $53.438, and now trades for 41 times what analysts project the company's 2000 earnings will be, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. Shares of Enron Corp., the largest trader of gas and electricity in North America, have nearly doubled this year to $84.875, or 60 times earnings. Meanwhile, El Paso Energy Corp.'s stock has jumped 61% this year to $62.375, or 24 times earnings.Traders at these and other companies are capitalizing on the wild price swings and supply fluctuations that have accompanied deregulation in some regional markets. Natural-gas prices have more than doubled in the past year, while supplies have tightened. And the rapid price fluctuations for electricity have prompted many large businesses to seek price protection through hedging or fixed-price contracts, generating large premiums for traders. But what many investors may not realize is that much of these companies' recent profits constitute unrealized, noncash gains. Frequently, these profits depend on assumptions and estimates about future market factors, the details of which the companies do not provide, and which time may prove wrong. And because of minimal disclosure standards in these kinds of cases, it's difficult for investors to assess whose assumptions might be too aggressive, or what market changes might invalidate the assumptions -- and force earnings revisions.\n",

      "4357 2813 John Buckley spoke at a program on derivatives presented by the D.C. BarSection on Taxation Committee on Financial Instruments and Products. Otherspeakers included Mark Price and Steve Rosenthal of KPMG, and Chuck Wheelerof Alston & Bird.Price said Financial Accounting Standard No. 133, adopted in 1998 by theFinancial Accounting Standards Board and amended in June (118 DTR G-7,6/19/00), requires separate accounting for derivatives, using amark-to-market approach like that used under Internal Revenue Code Section475. The new rule requires that any change in the value of the derivative be\"booked\"--included as a gain or loss in determining the company's income forfinancial accounting purposes--even if the company has not disposed of thederivative.The result, Price said, is to create increased volatility in the company'sdetermination of income and loss for accounting purposes. Wheeler said thatcompanies do not want this increased volatility to apply to theirdeterminations of income for tax purposes.Price said the accounting profession adopted new standards for derivativesbecause of numerous problems, including:* incomplete reporting, in that some companies reported no informationor reported information only in a footnote;* inconsistent reporting, in that companies used different rules fordetermining cost and value;* difficulty in applying the accounting rules; and* lack of transparency, in that companies took different approaches intheir treatment of derivatives,meaning income was not determined under the same rules andinformation on financial statements could not be compared with reliability.Issues for Congress to StudyBuckley said the mark-to-market approach is slowly beingadopted in the tax system. He said it was not something he favored acrossthe board but in his view it made sense for the tax system to apply themark-to-market approach to derivatives. He said the problems identified byPrice in accounting for derivatives also applied to the tax system--there isuncertainty and inconsistency.Buckley also said it would simplify recordkeeping to conformthe tax system to the accounting approach, and he favored Congress lookingat this question. He said that Congress's adoption of the mark-to-marketapproach for securities in the early 1990s was the right approach, and hethought that the Financial Accounting Standards Board had taken an\"interesting and important step\" in adopting FAS 133.Buckley said he sees the problem of defining a derivative asa major issue for the tax law, and questioned whether the accountingdefinition was \"workable.\" Other panelists said it is, but Price noted thatthe definition is very fact-specific, and Wheeler said the rules are so newit is too early to tell whether companies will attempt to structuretransactions to use the accounting definition.\n",

In aclosely related move, the FASB has also lately determined that effectivenext year, pure goodwill recorded on corporate balance sheets will no longerbe amortized, but will be subjected to an \"impairment\" approach.In a 14-page report, issued in mid May, a financial services firm, Friedman,Billings, Ramsey & Co. concluded that the net effects of these changes willbe bullish for stocks. \"We anticipate the psychological perception ofapplying current P/E ratios to higher future GAAP earnings will result inhigher stock prices,\" wrote the FBR's senior analyst, Laurie Hunsicker.

The planshave been drawn up by the Joint Working Group, a body made up mainly ofaccounting standard-setters from the world's biggest economies. Bankers saythe results would lead to dramatic swings in the value of balance sheetassets that would often be meaningless and potentially damaging.It is certainly the case that the existing accounting rules often fail toreflect the impact of changes in interest rates or credit risks on bankearnings. Fair value accounting would force banks to adjust their accountsin the light of rises and falls in the values of all financial instruments.The result would be greater volatility in profits but proponents of thechange say it would give investors a truer picture of corporate health.Not so, say the banks. While fair value accounting is appropriate fortrading activities, it would not reflect the real business of makinglong-term loans to customers, which are largely held to maturity andtherefore rarely traded.

      "4229 2685 \"It is basic accounting that you don't record equity until you get cash, and a note doesn't count as cash,\" says Lynn Turner, a former chief accountant for the SEC. \"The question that raises is: How did both partners and the manager on this audit miss this simple Accounting 101 rule?\" Adds Douglas Carmichael, an accounting professor at Baruch College in New York: \"Anyone that's an accountant looking at the entry should have known\" it violated GAAP. An Enron spokesman, Vance Meyer, says, \"The accounting error was just that -- an error,\" explaining that, \"We believed it was not material. However, it was, of course, corrected . . . And we did make the correction with Andersen's concurrence.\" He says Andersen \"performed limited quarterly reviews\" of the company's unaudited financial statements and reviewed the entries that resulted in the shareholder-equity overstatements \"to the extent they deemed necessary.\" To some who follow the accounting world closely, this has a familiar ring to it. During the past few years, every Big Five auditor has been hit by multiple accounting debacles at high-profile clients. For Andersen, Enron joins a list including Waste Management Inc. and Sunbeam Corp. While the names of the clients may change, the issues remain largely the same. For instance, Enron had reported net income of $105 million for 1997, a figure that Enron last week said will be reduced to $9 million in its upcoming restatement for that year. Enron said the reduction is mostly because of $51 million in various unexplained \"audit adjustments and reclassifications\" that its auditors had proposed in 1997 but at the time had determined to be \"immaterial.\" Cumulatively, those immaterial adjustments added up to nearly half of Enron's net income for 1997 and now will be included in the company's restatements. That looks a lot like what happened at Sunbeam. According to the SEC's May settlement order with Sunbeam, Andersen auditors had routinely dismissed so many violations of GAAP as immaterial that they eventually piled up to produce significant distortions in Sunbeam's financial statements, making the barely solvent consumer-products maker look handsomely profitable. Sunbeam filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court protection this past February. In May, the SEC filed a civil lawsuit against five former Sunbeam executives and the Andersen partner in charge of the company's audit, accusing them of engaging in a massive financial fraud; all six defendants have denied the SEC's allegations. Andersen itself wasn't named as a defendant and has said it believes the lawsuit against its partner was an unjustified action over questions of professional judgment.\n",

And while old-fashioned companies spread their profits out like an=nuities over a period of years, Enron took most of its profit up-front. How=ever many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years, they= went on the books in the current year. If a few analysts thought there mig=ht be something fishy about what they called \"subjective accounting,\" inves=tors didn't particularly care as long as the profits rolled in. As the mark=et fluctuated and the landscape changed, the company might abandon a projec=t that had been in the works for months because its profit margins weren't =going to be high enough. \"Enron is known for leaving people at the altar,\" =says one former employee. Winning the highest possible profits for the comp=any could even extend to Enron's attitude toward charity. When a fundraiser= for the Houston READ Commission, a literacy group, called on Enron for a c=ontribution, it was suggested that he start raising money for Enron's compe=ting literacy charity: \"Even the person who was supposed to give money away= for Enron was supposed to make money for Enron,\" he says.As Enron became more and more successful, the culture Skilling had created =took on a dark side: The competition turned inward. As one member of the En=ron family put it, \"It became a company full of mercenaries.\" The change st=arted at the bottom. As Enron's domination of the energy market grew, most =of the recruiting frills fell away. New associates were treated much like t=he commodities the company traded. Global Change's Enron spies reported ove=rhearing orders like \"I need a smart person-go buy me one\" or \"Buy me an in=telligent slave, quick.\" Enron had never been the kind of place where peopl=e sang to you on your birthday, but now the workaholism bordered on self-pa=rody: A Random Acts of Kindness program lasted only a few months. It was to=o disruptive. People couldn't get their work done.And, of course, Enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension=.

The other Exhibits have not been modified. The Marketing Strategy and Trading & Risk Policy have been discussed at length with MDEA (MDEA commercial, not legal), and their comments/questions incorporated.  7. It would help if theh commercial part of the team could send me the following, in words and/or formulae:The defn and method of establishing the bogey (target production cost) formula can be an exhibit, which would be great for the commercial team to work on. [Fairley, David] Thought we had this covered in the definitions and obligations of the parties. Will look at it again. Conceptually, MDEA, Services Group, and Orig are in full agreement, so we need to make sure that the contract language is clear enough.[Rorschach, Reagan] See attached exhibit detailing the calc with an example. Are we determined how we should deal with imbalances (part of cost of power)? [Fairley, David] There are three considerations on this: (1) who wears imbalance exposure?, (2) who manages imbalances (hourly type activity), and (3) who pays for imbalances? Imbalances are billed by Entergy directly to MDEA under their Network Services Agreement. EPMI's hourly desk manages the load/resource items hourly, but MDEA has the exposure (physical and price) to imbalances. Weather/load changes, and fluctuations in supply create hourly imbalances (they happen, they are uncontrollable, and we fix them) which EPMI's hourly desk manages as part of the imbalance service described in the definitions and obligations of the parties. A different section in the contract states that MDEA wears the exposure. How are we setting the bogey? Formula? [Fairley, David] The bogey is set when the load projection and stack models are run each day. Both parties participate by providing certain necessary info and discussing results and planning the day's activities. [Rorschach, Reagan] Records of bogey decisions will be archievedSubject to audit? [Fairley, David] Yes, but they would be auditing something that is jointly derived each day. Frankly, they would like to have less involvement; ie, they trust us to do it all, but we are requiring them to participate and buy in every day. Two bogeys or one (gas and oil)?[Fairley, David] One bogey for power. Gas is an input for determining the bogey.[Rorschach, Reagan] Bogey set day-ahead.What is defn of profit?

      "4080 2536 Bad trading. Enron's main technique to pump up earnings probably revolvedaround a loose-as-a-goose process for the accounting of energy derivatives.Called mark-to-market, the technique involves evaluating contracts at \"fairvalue\" prices. Since some of these contracts stretched out for 20 years, thefutures market provides no firm prices. And, absent a liquid market withclear prices, \"fair value\" becomes a mug's game in which companies canvastly inflate value. These overstated gains, of course, were also unrealized, noncash gains. InSeptember 2000, Jonathan Weil, a reporter for the Journal, took a look atEnron's second quarter and found that absent noncash earnings, Enron wouldhave had a loss. Mr. Weil later found that for the year as a whole,unrealized trading gains accounted for more than half of the company'soriginally reported pretax profits. Hardly a confidence-builder in thequality of Enron's earnings.When their derivative strategies started to go sour, this theory runs, Enronremoved the contracts from its financial statements and hid them in specialentities created for just that purpose.Bad Assets. Another theory locates Enron's earning problems in their hardassets. Enron had a bunch of huge and underperforming assets, like itsbroadband company, water company and power plants in India and Brazil. Inorder to hustle those assets and associated debts off its financial reports,the company created some limited partnerships to buy these dogs -- eitherwith bank loans or money provided by Enron itself. These partnerships(allegedly) transferred enough control to third parties to get them offEnron's balance sheet. Enron guaranteed these deals with \"make good\" provisions backed by Enronstock -- a promise that Enron would make good any losses in the value of thepartnerships. When the value of the assets tanked, the make-good provisionskicked in, resulting, for example, in the enormous write-down in shareholderequity in November.Depending on which theory one accepts, there are two bottom lines.The first holds that the sagging earnings problem was fatal and that it isentirely possible Enron was in the process of liquidating itself. Jim Chanosof Kynikos Associates hypothesizes that Enron's cost of capital was higherthan its returns on invested capital. A second argues that if Enron'smanagers had been content to accept the fact that in competitive marketstheir \"first mover\" advantage was going to be competed away, and had beenwilling to endure slower earnings growth, it would not be in bankruptcytoday.\n",

You should be prepared to consider the following questions, with the ultimate goal of determining and presenting your group's opinion of what the top priorities should be:Who are (or should be) our customers?What are their business requirements?What do they value?How and how well are we providing value to our customers and to Enron?What activities should we continue, start, or stop?If you don't receive your packet of preread materials by the end of the day Monday, please contact me at x36641.\n",

      "4377 2833 The significance of special charges -- whether they represent old baggage from the past or illuminate the future -- is at the center of a lively debate under way in the accounting world. One side holds that generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, provide the best available snapshot of a company's financial position. GAAP, which companies must use in their official financial statements, requires that nearly all charges be treated as ordinary expenses. Others, including many stock analysts, contend the best view comes from \"pro forma\" financial results -- calculated \"as if\" many expenses didn't really exist. The idea is that these expenses aren't relevant to future performance. Companies increasingly highlight the pro forma view in news releases they generally put out before their official filings with regulators. But pro forma calculations adhere to no particular standard. Companies essentially do what they want. Now, accountants and economists say the practice of excluding blemishes is so widespread that companies and analysts often guide investors to dismiss charges that contain prescient warnings -- like the one at Bethlehem Steel. Ms. Applebaum, the Salomon Smith Barney analyst who played down Bethlehem's big write-off, explains that she has covered other steel companies that returned to profitability shortly after writing off deferred tax assets. She thought Bethlehem would do the same. She notes that GAAP rules on such assets obliged Bethlehem to follow strict criteria in assessing its chances of future profitability -- stricter criteria than stock analysts typically use. As for Bethlehem, Chief Financial Officer Leonard M. Anthony says the charge the company took was to some extent \"predictive of the future.\" GAAP also has well-established standards for writing down other kinds of assets. Companies must reduce the value on their books of anything from a customer loan to a manufacturing plant when its worth has diminished. Again, Wall Street stock analysts tend to dismiss the resulting charges as one-time events. Sometimes that makes sense. During the 1981-82 recession, restructuring was a part of many corporations' strategies. They took charges for streamlining, outsourcing and otherwise shedding costs to position themselves for recovery. Because the resulting earnings volatility made it hard to compare companies' growth rates or price-earnings ratios, and because the charges weren't expected to recur, there was logic to excluding them to come up with \"smoothed\" earnings trends. \"Investors came to look upon the charges, correctly in many cases, as evidence that those firms had recognized past mistakes and had made tough decisions to become more efficient,\" said a September 2001 study by the Jerome Levy Economics Institute at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y.\n",

      "4360 2816 According to the AASB's chairman, Mr Keith Alfredson, the document on whichcomments will be invited is likely to ``blow the minds'' of many in thefinancial markets, major corporates and the accounting profession, judgingby the criticisms it has attracted even before its publication.But he said time for argument was fast running out. Whatever happened afterthe draft and invitation to comment were issued in the run-up to Christmas,``Australia will have to make a choice.''Accounting bodies worldwide have been working on standards for financialinstruments to prevent the derivatives -related disasters that rocked manycompanies during the late 1980s and early 1990s, including US companyProcter & Gamble, which lost $US157 million on interest-rate derivatives in1994.The matter has become urgent in Australia partly because the United Stateshas introduced its own standard Financial Accounting Standard Boardstatement No133 which became effective for some companies on July 1, andwhich will operate from January 1 for those whose financial years coincidewith the calendar.FAS 133 is regarded as a nightmare by corporate treasurers in the US andhere, because it requires derivatives and other financial instruments to be``marked to market'' every quarter, rather than accounted for on afair-value basis.Its critics claim it will lead to volatility and confusion in companyfinancial statements.Mr Alfredson said that in the US, ``there is now a special interpretationgroup like the Urgent Issues Group here interpreting 133. In other words, itis so complex, readers can't just read the standard and interpret it. Thegroup has already issued more than 100 interpretations.''Australia has no accounting standard that deals comprehensively with therecognition and measurement of financial instruments, although it has madeprogress with disclosure requirements. Acknowledging the concern over themark-to-market approach, the AASB commissioned the development of afair-value model.The joint working group consists of representatives from Australia, Canada,France, Germany, New Zealand, the Nordic countries, Britain, the US and theInternational Accounting Standards Committee. IASC has incorporated elementsof FAS 133 into its own much-criticised financial instruments standard, IAS39.It remains to be seen how much simpler the fair-value approach will be.``In fair-value accounting, you get the market value for the instruments atthe time and fair value them. It sounds easy in principle, but it is muchmore complicated in practice,'' Mr Alfredson said.Developing the appropriate standard is only half the battle, however; thetrick is to gain widespread acceptance for it. Even if Australia acceptedthe fair-value model, Mr Alfredson said, it would not be able to implementit alone, ``at least if I have any influence''.\n",

What is FERC's accounting position on the Exposure Draft related to Accounting for Certain Activities Related to Property, Plant, and Equipment, and is the FERC going to author a formal comment?2. With increased emphasis and regulation related to pipeline safety and integrity, it appears that a number of companies in the industry are embarking on significant programs to throughly test their systems. A significant aspect of a program of this nature is smart pigging and hydrostatic testing. What is the FERC's accounting position on possible capitalization of these costs? 3. Of recent, the FASB has issued new rules, ie., SFAS 142 on Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, and SFAS 143 - Asset Retirement Obligations. Is the FERC going to issue regulatory accounting guidance on these new rules?4. \"GAAP\"-\"RAP\" differences has for some time been a informal topic of discussion. With increased FASB rulemaking activity this risk may be increasing. Since \"RAP\" is mandated by Federal Law has the FERC have any concerns that pipeline application of \"GAAP\" that may be deemed, at variance to \"RAP\" may also be violation of federal law?

      "4440 2896 WASHINGTON -- As Congress opens a slew of hearings about Enron Corp.'s coll=apse, outraged lawmakers who are pointing fingers about bad accounting migh=t well beware of fingers pointing right back.=20House and Senate interrogators are questioning how the energy-trading compa=ny's financial mess could escape auditors' detection. But they shoulder som=e of the blame: Congress, including some of Enron's most vocal critics ther=e, routinely opposed significant new accounting rules over the past decade.Lynn Turner, head of Colorado State University's Center for Quality Financi=al Reporting and a former chief accountant at the Securities and Exchange C=ommission, cites several attempts to improve accounting standards throughou=t the 1990s that Congress fought. One effort, in particular, would have str=engthened the authority of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, an ind=ependent rule-making body.=20The standards board has come under blistering attacks each time from compan=ies who press Congress not to require new accounting disclosures. \"Pressure=s from some members of Congress have unfortunately led to compromises that =I don't believe were always in the interest of investors,\" Mr. Turner says.==20Some prominent past critics of the standards board are playing a different =tune. Beyond zeroing in on Enron's own longtime auditor, Arthur Andersen LL=P, Congress intends to explore whether to toughen requirements for how comp=anies are audited and what information must be disclosed to investors.=20Consider Rep. Richard Baker, the Louisiana Republican who chairs a House su=bcommittee on capital markets, securities and government-sponsored enterpri=ses. At a hearing last month, Mr. Baker asked an SEC official whether \"we n=eed better disclosure or accounting standards that give investors the real =picture?\" And later, expressing dismay about Enron's misleading disclosures=, he asked Andersen's chief executive, Joseph Berardino, if authorities nee=d to impose penalties for improper disclosure \"so severe that it ain't wort=h the risk?\"=20Yet Mr. Baker was a strong opponent of a standards board proposal, that rec=ently was approved, that requires companies to better disclose their use of= derivatives; those are investments pegged to the underlying value of asset=s, such as commodities or currencies. The standard board's new rules seek t=o ensure that corporate financial statements accurately reflect those risks=.=20Mr. Baker called hearings about the proposal after banking regulators and i=ndustry groups objected that the standards board hadn't adequately consider=ed earnings volatility that the derivatives disclosure might cause for comp=anies -- particularly banks, the biggest users of derivatives.=20When the standards board pressed ahead, Mr. Baker introduced a bill to allo=w public companies to object to proposed accounting principles in federal c=\n",

      "3899 2355 CHICAGO, Jan. 2 /PRNewswire/ -- Andersen today announced that its system of accounting and auditing quality has been deemed to provide reasonable assurance of compliance with professional standards, following the most extensive peer review in the firm's history. Deloitte & Touche's report, which includes an unmodified opinion for the review year ended August 31, 2001, has been accepted by the Peer Review Committee of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' (AICPA) SEC Practice and is available at the AICPA, http://www.aicpa.org/members/div/secps/index.htm . Every three years since 1978, major accounting firms, under the oversight of the Public Oversight Board (POB), have been engaged to conduct reviews of the accounting and auditing practices of member firms in the AICPA SEC Practice Section (SECPS). The scope of this year's peer review of Andersen was expanded after financial reporting issues emerged at Enron Corp. Andersen requested, and Deloitte & Touche had separately concluded, that expanded procedures were appropriate. Deloitte & Touche independently determined the scope of the expanded peer review procedures.In total, the peer and Andersen's internal practice review covered 240 Andersen audit engagements in over 30 Andersen offices and the Andersen national office. The engagements reviewed by Deloitte & Touche reviewers and Andersen practice review teams involved some 45 percent of Andersen's U.S. audit partners. The engagements selected for review represented a cross-section of Andersen's accounting and auditing practice with emphasis on higher-risk engagements. It included examining working paper files and reports and interviewing engagement personnel. Deloitte & Touche's opinion was \"unmodified,\" without qualification. However, three issues not deemed significant enough to affect the opinion were raised in an attached comment letter. Such comments are not unusual in peer review reports. The comments related to: documentation of certain auditing procedures on some engagements; communications with audit committees in some instances; and management representation letters that needed more tailoring in some instances. In its response to Deloitte & Touche's comments, Andersen said it had taken, or would take, the steps recommended to improve its accounting and auditing practices. About Andersen\n",

My impression is that it is the obligation of the product development people to make sure that the products that they are selling are billable and i will help them identify where the prices are coming from.. how they do it is something that is beyond all the mess that i am willing to tackle at this time.

      "4438 2894 The accounting scandal at Enron Corp. has prompted other companies to consi=der following a move by Walt Disney Co. to cease using their external audit=ors to do consulting work.=20While many companies say they see no need to separate the functions, Cornin=g Inc., Mirant Corp. and New York Times Co. are among those saying they mig=ht consider the step.The collapse of Houston energy trader Enron Corp. brought new scrutiny to t=he common practice of companies using one accounting firm both to audit the= books and to provide lucrative consulting services -- with companies somet=imes paying much more for the nonaudit services.=20Some audit firms, facing strong criticism of the practice, aren't waiting f=or clients to act. Yesterday Arthur Andersen LLP, which audited and did con=sulting work for Enron, became the latest to react. Andersen said it will n=o longer accept internal-audit and financial information-systems work from =publicly traded clients to which it provides external audit services.=20Disney last week became the first major company to announce it would separa=te auditing from consulting, saying that though there were no problems with= outside auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, it wanted to be free from conc=erns about auditor independence. Disney's move rendered moot a shareholder =initiative, scheduled for the annual meeting later this month, that questio=ned the company's use of its auditor for consulting services.=20Many companies try to ensure audit independence through rules that require =board members to approve the use of outside accountants for other services.= Others place limits on the fees paid to accountants. At the same time, que=stions about the practice are prompting executives to re-examine their poli=cies, to make sure safeguards are sufficient to prevent conflicts of intere=st.=20This week, Corning's board-level audit committee will consider adding restr=ictions to its auditing and consulting-fee policies, said Paul Rogoski, a c=ompany spokesman. In light of the Enron situation, \"we're going to look at =what our current process is and see if it needs to be updated,\" Mr. Rogoski= said. For 2000, the most recent figures available, Corning, a Corning, N.Y=., optical-fiber maker, paid $2.5 million in auditing fees to Pricewaterhou=se and $13.3 million to the firm in consulting fees.=20Mirant, an Atlanta energy firm, says it probably will study the Disney move= as part of a \"constant review\" of its audit policy, though it typically tr=ies to separate audit work from consulting jobs. \"We're making every effort= we can to be non-Enron-like,\" a company spokesman said. In 2000, the compa=ny paid Arthur Andersen LLP $2.2 million for auditing services, another $1.=2 million for financial information-systems services, and $10.1 million for= other services, including help with its initial public offering and tax co=nsulting.=20\n",

But we can't stop at Arthur Andersen. The real \"values\" crisis represented by the Enron mess is far deeper, and stretches across our economy. We are all being victimized by it, and the situation is growing ever worse. It is the great unreported business story of our time: the growing failure of the accounting system to accurately capture what is going in the new hyperspeed economy. Simply put, we have no idea what any company is worth today. The accounting industry is mired in a system that was devised 600 years ago and has only been fine-tuned ever since. It doesn't work any more. Accountants know it, corporate executives know it, and the stock market knows it. The general recognition of this fact has led to a widespread ethical sloppiness made manifest in such things as Arthur Andersen's apparent conflict. The reality is that the only time anybody really checks an audit anymore is after a financial disaster like Enron, when scapegoats must be found. Rear-View Mirror Accounting I once likened traditional accounting to driving a car by only looking in the rear view mirror. It can tell you where a company has recently been, but it is unable to tell you where that company is now. And in a world in which change occurs in nanoseconds, such obsolete data is worthless. Today, events arrive so swiftly, and change so constant, that it is no longer even enough to operate in the present. Modern business now runs in the future. The result is a growing gap between traditional \"book\" value and actual market value - and through that gap drives not only companies like Enron, but truly valuable firms like General Electric and Intel. Traditional accounting has long dealt with that gap through a line entry entitled \"goodwill.\" But it was typically only added when a company sold for more than the total value of its inventory, buildings, etc. At most, this goodwill only represented a few percent of the total value. That was then. In the modern economy, for great, fast moving, innovative young companies this so-called \"goodwill\" can represent 90 percent of their value. When a corporate audit can only tell us about ten percent of a company, what the hell is the point? There have been a number of efforts in recent years to come up with innovative new ways to determine corporate value, many of them under the all-encompassing terms \"intellectual capital\" or \"intangible assets\". But they are still in their earliest stages, and most slam up against the formidable wall of the traditional accounting industry.\n",

It is working toward issuing a single setof high quality accounting rules that could be used by companies around theworld in raising capital.Heavy Involvement of National BoardsThe path to that goal will include heavy involvement of major nationalstandard-setting bodies in the rulemaking of IASB. The mechanisms for thatwork--which are to include joint projects and other \"partnership workingarrangements\"--were detailed in a meeting May 24 with the heads ofstandard-setting panels from Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, NewZealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. IASB has formal\"liaison\" relationships with those boards.A sharing of human resources by the sparely staffed IASB and groups such asthe U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board would be complemented by atrading of knowledge, the rulemakers suggested. \"I expect that the FASBwill gain as much as it gets out of the work of IASB,\" FASB Chairman EdmundJenkins told the international board and his counterparts from around theworld.IASB 'Not a Dictator'At the May 24 meeting, IASB Chairman David Tweedie and his colleagues soughtto provide assurances that the newly restructured international panel willnot usurp the authority of the national standard-setters.

      "4059 2515 Subject: Driving Direct CP IssuanceE-FINANCEDriving Direct CP IssuanceNew Product Lets Issuers Build Real-Time Market PictureBy Susan KellyLast December, Julie Nickoley, senior manager of commercial paperoperations at DaimlerChrysler, agreed to work with Prescient Markets todevelop a Web-based subscription technology service to help companies priceand manage their commercial paper issuance. The goal: a system to providereal-time flow of short-term prices and a way to track investors andcompeting issuers. At the time, the global automaker and long-time directCP issuer saw the possibilities as interesting, but not necessarily apriority.All that changed two months later, when DaimlerChrysler's CP was downgradedto A2/P2. Suddenly, big money-market funds, which once constituted 85% ofDaimlerChrysler's market, were no longer buyers. Nickoley had an immediateneed to figure out what other buyers existed out in the market to taketheir place, but it took her a day or two to get investor information outof the mainframe-based system she used to manage CP issuance.In October, the kind of capability Nickoley sought finally became availablewith the introduction of Prescient Funding Desk. Now we know for allcustomers what time of day they trade, what size of trade they normally do,if they come in through cpmarket or on the phone, says Nickoley. Thecustomer analytics was the key.With the development of Funding Desk, companies can get information onprices, including fluctuations in competitors? CP rates and what investorsare looking for in the market on a real-time basis. Funding Desk's pricingmodule provides short-term market rates from Prebon Yamane and CP ratesfrom cpmarket.com, Prescient?s online platform for direct issuance of CP.In Tune with MarketThe advantages? Trades done on cpmarket.com flow automatically into FundingDesk, and Prescient says it is working on a link with Bloomberg that willbring in data on trades done on Bloomberg's CP platform. Companies can saveon funding costs by using the data to target less yield-sensitiveinvestors. They can also save money by knowing when competitors move ratesand then matching those moves. Using Funding Desk, we're much more in tuneto whether pricing is changing in the market, DaimlerChrysler's Nickoleysays. Besides cost savings, issuers may simply want to keep tabs on theirinvestors to ensure that no one investor holds too large a chunk, in orderto lessen the risk of having to scramble to find other buyers if a biginvestor exits suddenly.\n",

Without integrity in financial repo=rting, the U.S. cannot hope to remain the preeminent place to invest in the= global marketplace (page 76).=20The dot-com bubble was the first indication that there was something seriou=sly wrong with accounting standards. Companies without much of a business m=odel customized their quarterly statements to exclude a grab bag of expense=s in order to put a positive financial spin on their operations. Wall Stree=t conspired in this and encouraged big companies to join in. Soon, the meth=od of calculating earnings began to vary from company to company and even f=rom quarter to quarter within a company. It is now chaos.A stricter adherence to accounting rules won't solve the entire problem. GA=AP, the generally accepted accounting principles, allow all kinds of one-ti=me expenses and noncash charges. This obscures the performance of ongoing o=perations. No one can fathom what are true operating earnings because there= are no guidelines as to what constitutes an extraordinary expense. The res=ult is total confusion. Take earnings per share for the Standard & Poor's 5=00-stock index for the second quarter. Under Thomson Financial/First Call s=tandards, it is $11.82. But it's $9.02 according to S&P and $4.83 under GAA=P. How can investors make intelligent decisions?=20The Financial Accounting Standards Board clearly is failing to do its job. =It has promised to write a set of rules that calculates operating earnings =and relates them to net earnings, but it hasn't delivered. The rating agenc=y Standard & Poor's (owned by The McGraw-Hill Companies, as is BusinessWeek=) is doing a better job. It recently drew up a definition of ``operating ea=rnings'' that includes restructuring costs (including severance), writedown=s from ongoing operations, and the cost of stock options.

      "4456 2912 NEW YORK, Nov 29 (Reuters) - As experts look through the remains of Enron C=orp. for someone to blame, eyes are turning toward the auditors who allowed= it to break accounting rules, rather than on the rules themselves.=20Once the biggest trader in the newly deregulated power market, Enron is now= near collapse. The auditing profession, which gives financial statements t=he stamp of approval, needs to be more vigilant to prevent similar future d=isasters, the experts said.\"The auditors - the Big Five auditing firms - have got to look at themselve=s and say, how can this sort of thing happen?\" said David Hawkins, an accou=nting consultant with Merrill Lynch and a professor at Harvard University.==20\"The rules are there. Have we lost our way, so to speak? Do we need a new c=ompass direction?\"=20Enron, once a Wall Street darling with a share price that hit more than $90=, started coming apart after it reported losses from transactions that were= led by its former chief financial officer and kept off its balance sheet.==20Experts said it failed to apply generally accepted accounting principles an=d failed to disclose sufficient information to explain its dealings.=20Andersen, the accountancy firm that audited Enron's books, said such judgme=nts are premature.=20\"The best idea is to gather information, as the Securities and Exchange Com=mission and Enron board are doing, and then decide what lessons we can lear=n,\" Andersen spokesman David Tabolt said. \"Instant judgments often are base=d on presumptions ... that often turn out later to be incorrect.\"=20ACCOUNTING 101=20But the rules that Enron appears to have violated are quite straightforward=, according to some experts.=20For example, recording the note Enron received in return for selling equity= to its limited partnerships as an asset is contrary to an accounting rule =that bans such treatment unless the note is to be paid off in a few days, H=awkins said.=20Ultimately, those transactions turned sour, causing a $1.2 billion reductio=n in shareholder equity and losses that contributed to a $1 billion third-q=uarter charge.=20\"This is Accounting 101 here,\" said Paul Brown, chairman of the accounting =department at New York University's Stern School of Business. \"It may be th=at the way it was dressed up was so complicated that it was hard for the au=ditors to ferret it out but, then again, that's their job.\"=20The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), which sets accounting rule=s, said firms must disclose extensive information about related-party trans=actions. Enron may well have violated the spirit of that law by inadequatel=y explaining its transactions, the experts said.=20When Enron began to unravel, analysts criticized Andersen for failing to ex=plain the firm's dealings in its financial statements. Enron reported its t=ransactions in cryptic footnotes that many said were almost incomprehensibl=e.=20\n",

      "4303 2759 LONDON -(Dow Jones)- Issues bedeviling the accounting profession for years have finally flashed into the headlines, thanks to Enron and the bursting of the Internet bubble.Unhappily, most are unlikely to be solved anytime soon. Questions of auditor independence and the use of pro forma statements are at the fore. Not far behind are ones on accounting for options and goodwill. And then there's the issue of which standards to use. Right now, \"who guards the guardians\" has leapfrogged to the top of the agenda. The Enron collapse shows that auditors need to be more independent. It's a thinly-disguised fiction that auditors are paid by and act on behalf of shareholders. Clearly, it's corporate management doing the hiring and firing of auditors. And audit itself makes little profit. Instead, accountants rely on consulting and more technical or specialized practices, like M&A, to generate fees. An accountant refusing to pass a company's results runs the risk of losing a big part of his own business. Even the risk of litigation isn't - or at least hasn't been pre-Enron - enough of a deterrent. What's the solution? Make sure companies that audit aren't swayed by conflicts of interest. Regulators should either encourage stand-alone audit firms or prohibit auditors from any other involvement with the companies they scrutinize - even if that's tricky for big international corporations, which can use all of the \"big five\" accounting firms in the course of a year's global dealings. Another dilemma is the issue of pro formas. There's a mounting consensus that pro forma statements are suspect. According to some estimates, pro forma results for S&P 500 companies during the third quarter overstated audited profits by 70%. Why should companies push their pro formas when, after all, there's a perfectly good U.S. audited accounting standard: the U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)? Enron notwithstanding, surveys show investors are more confident with U.S. corporate results than those from Europe or Japan. And yet, U.S. GAAP has its own problems. U.S. accounting is rigidly based on rules, unlike elsewhere, where it's more a case of applying broad principles. Though these rules are designed to ensure standards, they're often subverted by loopholes. U.S. companies can comply with the letter of the law but still offer a distorted picture of fundamentals. The result is that while investors are flooded with information, it's not always helpful in determining a company's value. Enron highlighted one such loophole. The company went under in large part because it was taking on huge, unseen liabilities. These liabilities weren't on the balance sheet, having been planted on special vehicles nominally independent of the firm.\n",

      "4491 2947 When it was flying high, energy-trading company Enron Corp. was famous for =pioneering new markets. Here is something else it is helping to develop: a =relatively new breed of shareholder proposal.=20A number of institutional investors -- with Enron's rapid collapse in mind =-- are calling for companies to adopt \"conflict of interest policies\" that =would prevent their accounting firm from providing anything beyond auditing= services. Shareholder proposals seeking to limit the accounting firms' rol=es have surfaced at a wide range of companies following Enron's meltdown. A=t the heart of such proposals: concerns that accounting firms have a financ=ial incentive to sign off on overly aggressive accounting practices at comp=anies that simultaneously pay them large sums for nonaudit work.In Enron's case, the Houston company paid Arthur Andersen LLP $25 million f=or its audit and $27 million for nonauditing work, including tax-related an=d consulting services, in 2000, the last year for which figures are publicl=y available. In November, Enron restated its results for the previous four =years, wiping out $586 million, or 20%, of its previously reported earnings=. In recent testimony before Congress, Andersen officials have said they do=n't believe their independence as an auditor was compromised by the nonaudi=ting fees.=20\"It took Enron to get shareholders interested in addressing this issue, but= many investors want auditor independence,\" says Patrick McGurn, vice presi=dent of Institutional Shareholder Services, a proxy adviser that makes reco=mmendations for how institutions should vote.=20Shareholders are proposing these policies for about 30 companies, including= Apple Computer Corp., Johnson & Johnson, Motorola Inc., PG&E Corp. and Wal=t Disney Co. Most of the companies are fighting the initiatives and have as=ked the Securities and Exchange Commission to rule that they don't have to =put the proposals to a vote. Corporate-governance specialists expect the SE=C to rule in favor of shareholders, putting the initiatives on the ballots =for annual meetings later this year.=20Whether any of the proposals become policy at the individual companies is a=nother matter; rarely do shareholder proposals pass. But some who track cor=porate-governance developments say support for these new ones could be stro=ng enough to prompt companies to agree to limit the use of their auditing f=irms for other activities. \"It can embarrass management,\" says John C. Coff=ee Jr., law professor at Columbia University. \"The real success of these ki=nds of proposals is that they will lead to negotiations . . . that might pu=t restrictions on the amount of consulting that these companies can do.\"=20The no-conflict-of-interest initiatives are being proposed by labor unions,= which hold shares in companies as part of pension plans and other investme=nts.

      "3751 2207 bearish, it has in the market, Dynegy executives say that information, like the estimates behind its mathematical models, is proprietary. Such disclosures may be outdated anyway by the time they could be included in public financial filings, says Michael Mott, a Dynegy vice president. Mr. Mott further explains that Dynegy could be realizing more cash earnings now if it wanted to. But \"we don't see that would be in the best interests of shareholders,\" Mr. Mott says, because the company figures it can earn more later by leaving much of its gains unrealized for now.   Mr. Linsmeier of Michigan State compares the current situation for energy traders with the accounting controversies that engulfed subprime automobile and residential lenders during the late 1990s, though he emphasizes it's too far early to tell whether the consequences will be similar. Using so-called gain-on-sale accounting (a form of mark-to-market accounting), those lenders booked earnings from loans as soon as they were made, rather than having to wait for them to be paid off, as banks typically do.   But as interest rates fell in 1998, many customers paid off their loans earlier than expected, slashing lenders' profit margins. Compounding matters, the market for mortgage-backed securities dried up in the wake of financial chaos in Russia and other foreign markets, leaving lenders to bear the higher risks of many new loans.   Many investors complained they were blindsided, in part because these lenders generally hadn't disclosed their assumptions about prepayment rates and other variables. After the crash, subprime lenders routinely began disclosing the key assumptions used to value their mortgage portfolios.   At New York University, accounting professor Baruch Lev says investors would be better served if energy traders' financial filings explained the effects of hypothetical commodity-price movements on the values of their risk-management assets, and disclosed the basic assumptions about future commodity-price movements ingrained in their mathematical models. Says Mr. Lev, \"I would like to see much more disclosure, particularly given that this is now becoming a significant component of their earnings.\"\n",

The research is expected to include a close reading of FASBdocuments chronicling that board's odyssey toward what it calls the\"impairment-only approach\" for goodwill.As noted by FASB members now on IASB, the U.S. board went down that pathbecause it tries wherever possible to avoid affording choices in accounting.The impairment-only method is favored by many in commerce because itprevents the drag on earnings presented by the automatic writedown ofgoodwill.Tweedie Offers Project ProposalsOther topics that Tweedie suggested should be in the scope of IASB'spreliminary study leading to a rulemaking project on combinations are: jointventures, which Tweedie called a \"big escape route\" around the negativeeffects of the purchase method for combinations and goodwill amortization;dual listings of stock of otherwise joined enterprises, said to be anothermethod of accounting avoidance; and acquisition provisioning, a practice inthe United Kingdom.In Britain, where Tweedie headed the Accounting Standards Board in the 1990sand into 2000, the impairment test for goodwill in combinations is strongerthan the mechanism planned by FASB, the IASB chairman said. However, asTweedie and an IASB colleague, Warren McGregor, noted, the economy largelyhas been strong over the last several years.

If structured financing is sort for EIM then it would be appropriate to talk to either David Tregar (Metals Commercial) or Bill Appleby (Global Finance) as an intro to the issues faced.4. Curve Management ProcessThe markets in which our merchanting division trades are based on the LME curves but are linked to a large number of basis curves for quality and location. Given the vast number we have opted to break down the markets by brand group and port location. E.G. for Copper this means we have a grid with 5 brand groups and 3 sets of port groups (13 for europe, 7 for the US and 6 for the Far East). The maintaince & price testing of the grids is made manageable by the fact the premiums only need be entered for brand and port groups by the traders yet prices can be tested by reference to node points i.e. price of specific brand at a given location which can be checked to a market quote.5.

      "4520 2976 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- There may one good thing that comes out of the Enron Corp. (ENE) financial mess - stricter accounting rules governing consolidation of financial results.Enron acknowledged earlier Thursday that it incorrectly accounted for its relationships with related partnerships by keeping them off its financial statements. It corrected that mistake by consolidating the partnerhips into its results, a move that led Enron to restate three years worth of earnings, lowering them by a collective $586 million. Under current accounting regulations, companies don't have to consolidate loss or income from entities in which they have an interest below 51%, keeping those losses or gains off their books (the balance sheets and income statements). The Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, has been working on a project that would replace the standard of ownership by a more encompassing one of control. But that project has been languishing since 1982 when the board first started considering the issue. \"This is an area where FASB is struggling\" to set new criteria, said Alan Bromberg, a professor of corporate and securities law at the Dedeman School of Law of The Southern Methodist University. FASB has struggled in part because companies were fighting the changes and it has had difficulty in defining control to mean something other than majority ownership. The Enron's restatement and consolidation is also focusing attention on another arcane accounting rule, one dealing with minimum ownership by unaffiliated outsiders. Under a statement made by the Securities and Exchange Commission during an Emerging Issue Task Force meeting over a decade ago, the SEC stated that a minimum outside investment was needed for the special purpose entity to qualify for non consolidation. This guideline has remained in effect ever since. According to EITF documents dated 1989 and 1990, a minimum outside investment of 3% or more in a special purpose entity may be necessary, depending on the credit risk, for it to qualify for non-consolidation status. Given that some of the special entities created by Enron were controlled by some of its former executives, experts said it's possible that the SEC was considering the outside ownership of these entities insufficient for them to qualify for non consolidation. Meanwhile, it's unclear how Arthur Andersen LLP, Enron's independent auditor since the late 1980s, will be affected by the company's restatement and recent financial turmoil. A spokesman for Arthur Andersen said his firm \"continues to cooperate with Enron and its special committee to bring a resolution to this matter.\" The accounting giant has had some recent run-ins with shareholders and regulators because of accounting issues. It recently agreed to pay $110 million to settle a shareholder lawsuit over audits it conducted for Sunbeam Corp. Sunbeam had been accused of overstating its revenues and subsequently went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\n",

The topic of intangibles was thesubject of extended debate among FASB's seven members as they weighed itsimportance in allocating staff resources to such a project or to two otherissues vying for the attention of rulemakers. FASB heard arguments from one board member, John Wulff, suggesting that aneffort to simplify and codify standards and other guidance that formstatements of generally accepted principles, together with writing standardson revenue recognition and defining liability, may be more suitablecandidates for rulemaking. Major U.S. corporations, through at least onetrade group, the Institute of Management Accountants, counseled the coursedescribed by Wulff, a former leader of Financial Executive International'sCommittee on Corporate Reporting. That committee opposes FASB's taking onthe performance reporting and intangibles projects as outlined in aprospectus issued about two months ago. FASB settled on a compromise plan offered by board Chairman Edmund Jenkins.In the compromise, the panel's staff will carry out further preparatory workon intangible assets. At the same time, FASB's staff will study the threepotential projects--revenue recognition and liability definition,simplification and codification of accounting rules, and disclosures aboutintangibles--with an eye toward deciding an appropriate use of staffaccountants' time. The additional work on intangibles is to focus onsummarizing existing research on such non-concrete assets as in-processresearch and development, patents, and customer lists, with particular focuson questions about what information on intangibles is useful to investors,security analysts, and other users of financial statements. FASB would notcarry out polling or surveys, the board emphasized. The board tentativelyset a deadline of Dec. 24 for completion of the two-pronged work by itsstaff. That timetable would suggest FASB plans to make a more definitivedecision on adding a second, or even a third, standard-setting project inearly 2002.\n",

      "3460 1916 A 'Very Difficult Time' Some audit controls, such as using computers to spot financial conflicts of interest with prospective clients, improved during four years of SEC prodding, Bowsher said. Other shortcomings continue because of resistance in the accounting industry, he said. \"We were pushing on some of these issues, but we were having a very difficult time having these things improved,'' Bowsher said in an interview. Peer reviews and accounting oversight are in the forefront of debate about audit regulations in the wake of Enron's collapse. The energy trader blamed bookkeeping errors, in financial statements certified by Andersen, for the need to restate earnings going back to 1997. Still, Andersen got unqualified good marks in its latest peer review, released Jan. 2. Andersen's reviewer, Deloitte & Touche LLP, looked at 240 audits after Andersen asked its rival for tougher-than-normal scrutiny while questions swirled about Enron. Enron's audit was not among those examined.Pitt's Proposal Pitt's outline for change calls for the SEC to work with the biggest accounting firms to create a private oversight body, with funding from outside the accounting industry, to monitor and discipline auditors. Former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt, who appointed Turner, said last week that Pitt's proposal ``needs more teeth.'' An April 1997 letter, the earliest released under the freedom of information request, questioned whether cost saving in the name of efficiency was hurting the quality of audits and producing fewer records than peer reviewers needed. \"Some changes being undertaken in pursuit of operating goals, such as reducing audit hours and focusing audit objectives on increasing the perceived value of the audit to client management, may have the effect of compromising audit quality,'' wrote Michael Sutton, who was then SEC's chief accountant.

The letter was signed by heads of the US,European and Japanese banking associations.\"We are keen to implement the new accord in 2004, but we see no absolutereason why the end-of-the-year timetable has to be kept,\" said MaurizioSella, president of the European Banking Federation. \"It's much better toget out a proposal that's right even if it is a few months' late.\"The committee published its latest draft of the proposed Basle 2 accord inJanuary and set a deadline for consultation with the industry to becompleted by the end of May. But many financial operators believe this isnow unrealistic.The banking associations are asking for detailed papers to be sent to themby August so that they could respond by October.\"The Basle committee has bitten off more than it can chew,\" said IanLinnell, banking analyst at credit rating agency Fitch. \"The accord in itsdraft form is incredibly aggressive and a contains a number of black holesthat require further work.\"Banks want detailed papers on the treatment of retail, equity and projectfinance portfolios. They are also asking for more information on the wayoperational risk - unexpected losses - will be treated, and for details onaspects of securitisation, counterparty risk and disclosure.The letter points out that in a number of important areas the Baslecommittee's second consultation document has either come up with newproposals or indicated that final proposals are to come.\"Taken together these greener areas will have a critical impact on theoutcome of the proposals for individual firms and the industry as a whole,\"the letter says.The banks are particularly concerned about the levels of capital that wouldhave to be carried by some institutions to cover operational risk.\n",

      "4297 2753 01/03/2002Chicago TribuneNorth Sports Final ; N3(Copyright 2002 by the Chicago Tribune)Accounting firm Andersen said Wednesday that its auditing practice responsible for checking the books of bankrupt energy trader Enron Corp. has been given a clean bill of health in a peer review by another accounting firm, but some observers criticized the findings. The review, performed by rival Big Five firm Deloitte & Touche, was part of an assessment carried out once every three years to check the quality of financial reporting of top firms.Andersen's accounting systems were \"deemed to provide reasonable assurance of compliance with professional standards,\" according to a statement from the Chicago-based firm. \"Deloitte's opinion was unmodified, without qualification,\" for the year ended Aug. 31, Andersen added. But the integrity of the process was criticized almost immediately by analysts, including professor Lynn Turner, a former Securities and Exchange Commission chief accountant and current director of the Center for Quality Financial Reporting at Colorado State University. \"If the process was really credible, I don't think we'd be having the rash of problems we are having today,\" Turner said. Turner cited reporting problems that have cost investors billions of dollars at Enron, such other Andersen clients as Waste Management Inc. and Sunbeam Corp., and similar high-profile failures at Cendant Corp., Rite Aid Corp. and MicroStrategy Inc. after audits by other accounting firms. Critics of the peer review process point to the fact that since the cooperative assessments began in 1978, no Big Five accounting firm has received a qualified opinion of its accounting procedures from a rival. When Enron filed for bankruptcy protection in December, it was Andersen's Houston office's largest client. The energy trader's collapse is the subject of a SEC investigation, lawsuits and a number of congressional probes. According to Deloitte's letter of comment, which accompanied the unqualified opinion, Andersen was told about a need to improve minor documentation and communication problems. Andersen's peer review was all but complete when it asked in November for the review to be expanded to include the Houston office responsible for auditing Enron, which had disclosed financial reporting problems that led to $1.2 billion being chopped from shareholders' equity. The assessment did not look specifically at the audit Andersen performed on Enron, because there is \"pending litigation\" over reporting problems, according to Deloitte's letter.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

      "4444 2900 Buckley said an additional issue would be whether gains andlosses from derivatives should be treated as capital or ordinary under amark-to-market approach.Hedge Accounting Reduces VolatilityWheeler said that some companies show reserves on theirfinancial statements to account for potential losses in value, but that thisis not generally used for tax reporting. Rosenthal said a current Tax Courtcase involves the Internal Revenue Service disputing a company's use of a\"credit adjustment\" to reduce income.Price said the rules allow companies to elect to use \"hedgeaccounting.\" He said a company which recognized gain or loss from aderivative identified as a hedge could have an offsetting gain or loss fromthe item being hedged. Thus, hedge accounting reduces the volatility createdby FAS 133 for companies that hedge their risk. However, FAS 133 contains astrict definition for a hedge, and an item could lose its character as ahedge because the definition is reapplied every quarter to the same item.The panelists noted that for tax purposes, once an item is considered ahedge, its character would not change subsequently.Price said the new FASB rule applies to entities that reportto the Securities Exchange Commission and are effective for fiscal yearsbeginning after June 15, 2000, and Jan. 1, 2001, for companies reporting ona calendar year.Ops Execs See Raised ProfileOperations Management - November 27, 2000Operations and technology executives are taking on a larger role withinfirms and ate receiving more senior job titles as a result, according to aRussell Reynolds Associates study to be released this week. \"The head ofoperations is no longer just a senior v.p., but is now at the partnerlevel,\" said George Wilbanks, partner with Russell Reynolds.The shift has been prompted by a number of factors, including the blurringof lines between banks, insurers,mutual fund firms and other financial services companies, and the growingimportance of multiple channels and the subsequent complexity of operationsand information. \"Firms need much more robust technology and operationsplatforms to handle the added complexity,\" Wilbanks said.

      "4258 2714 October 2001 - Andersen's concerns mushroom about how Enron will report its third-quarter results, and whether the report will pass muster legally and reflect generally accepted accounting practices. Oct. 9, Andersen hires an outside law firm to advise the firm amid its growing concern about the Enron account, indicating Andersen was becoming concerned about its legal liability. Oct. 12, Temple sends an e-mail to an Andersen executive, who forwarded it to Duncan, in which the Andersen attorney says: \"It might be useful to consider reminding the (Enron) engagement team of our documentation and retention policy. It will be helpful to make sure we have complied with the policy.\" The policy addresses \"organization, retention and destruction\" of client information. Also Oct. 12, Duncan receives a draft press release from Enron in which the company plans to describe its $1 billion charge against income as a nonrecurring item. Three days later, Duncan sends a memo to \"the files\" outlining his Oct. 14 discussion with Enron Chief Accounting Officer Rick Causey. Duncan voiced \"strong concerns\" that describing the charge as nonrecurring \"could be misconstrued or misunderstood by investors.\" Duncan also noted that he informed Causey that Andersen was aware of enforcement actions undertaken by the Securities and Exchange Commission \"in cases where they believe such a presentation was materially misleading.\" Oct. 15, Enron issued a press release describing the charge as nonrecurring. Oct. 16, Temple sends an e-mail to Duncan advising him to delete her name from the memo about Andersen's concerns about Enron's handling of the third-quarter press release. \"Reference to the legal group consultation arguably is a waiver of attorney-client privileged advice and if my name is mentioned it increases the chances that I might be a witness, which I prefer to avoid.\" Around Oct. 19-20, Duncan learns the SEC has launched a formal inquiry of Enron's financial records and reporting. He informs the Andersen consultation group, which includes Temple. Oct. 22, Duncan and the Andersen auditing team meet with Causey, Enron's chief accounting officer, to discuss the SEC probe. Oct. 23, Duncan convenes an \"urgent meeting\" of the Enron auditing team, at which he organizes a concerted effort to destroy a \"significant\" number of documents of interest to SEC and congressional investigators, Andersen executives testify. Oct. 24, Enron fires Fastow, its chief financial officer. Oct. 25, Enron issues a notice advising that preservation of documents is required by law, given that the company was being sued by investors. The Duncan-led document destruction would continue through the first 10 days of November.\n",

      "4301 2757 11/12/2001The Wall Street JournalC1(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)What could Arthur Andersen have done to protect the investing public from Enron? Brushing up on a basic accounting textbook might have helped, some critics say. Confirming investors' fears, the Houston energy trader Thursday filed a lengthy disclosure document with the Securities and Exchange Commission declaring that its financial statements going back to 1997 \"should not be relied upon\" and will have to be restated. Among other problems, Enron acknowledged overstating its net income by a total of $586 million, or 20%. Enron's financial statements long have been widely assailed as indecipherable. Now, it turns out, they were just plain wrong.But what is most striking about the latest disclosures is that they show Enron's misstatements weren't limited merely to judgment calls and gray areas for the green-eyeshade crowd to debate. Portions of Enron's accounting practices amounted to violations of elementary accounting principles, some accounting specialists say. Citing client-confidentiality rules, an Andersen spokesman, David Tabolt, declines to comment on his firm's work for Enron, which on Friday agreed to be bought by crosstown rival Dynegy. He calls Enron's disavowal of its previous financial statements an \"unfortunate situation\" and says Andersen is cooperating with the SEC's Enron investigation and the special committee formed by Enron to investigate the company's accounting and disclosure practices. Consider the primary reason for the $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity that Enron revealed in mid-October, sparking much of the downdraft in the company's shares. At the time, Enron said the reduction came about because it had decided to unwind certain transactions with some limited partnerships with which it had done business. On Thursday, however, Enron acknowledged that the original accounting for the transactions violated generally accepted accounting principles. Starting in early 2000, the company said last week, Enron issued shares of its own common stock to four \"special-purpose entities,\" in exchange for which it received a note receivable. Enron said it had increased both its note-receivable assets and shareholder equity, a move the company called \"an accounting error\" that it is correcting. Under GAAP, the payment a company receives when issuing stock only counts as equity if it is cash. As a result, Enron's 2000 audited financial statements overstated the company's notes-receivable assets and shareholder equity by $172 million. And Enron's 2001 unaudited statements overstated them by $828 million. The $1 billion overstatement represents 8.5% of Enron's previously reported shareholder equity as of June 30.\n",

In October, 2001, the board said it =still wasn't ready to put a fix in place. Now, the recession has set off an=other wave of restructuring charges, and the FASB still doesn't have new ru=les.=20The slow pace means the standard-setters sometimes fail to react to sudden =changes in the market. The most recent failure followed the terrorist attac=ks on September 11. An FASB task force, unable to come up with a set of rul=es for separating September 11 costs from general expenses, instead told co=mpanies that the disaster could not be treated as an extraordinary item.

The temptation will be to take as big a charge as possible now, while =investors are braced for bad news.

Enron's wrinkle has long been \"divide and disavow,\" and it seems that, for the bankrupt energy trader and its lawyers, old gambits die hard. One of the principal components of the Enron scandal was the company's practice of creating partnerships and then using them to push its assets or debts off its books. Technically this can be legal, so long as the partnerships are truly separate, which, among other things, means that outside investors control as little as 3% of the partnership equity. The myth of separation--while still strongly believed by Enron itself--is losing support among the accounting firms who have been tainted by Enron and other recent scandals. The Big Five accounting firms are coming around to the idea that providing certain consulting services to the same company it is auditing creates an inherent conflict and is bad business. Until recently, the accounting profession bitterly opposed any limits on its consulting services, beating back rule changes proposed by Arthur Levitt when he was chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. But the Enron taint has spread past Enron's own auditor, Arthur Andersen, and the firms are seeking to police themselves lest others--such as the SEC--do it for them. PricewaterhouseCoopers and KPMG said yesterday said they would support such proposals. Andersen itself is said to be leaning in that direction and that it will soon announce substantial changes in how it does business. The Walt Disney Co. approved of the new regime of separation yesterday when its chairman, Michael Eisner, said the company would not use its independent auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers, for any new consulting work and would evaluate the current projects the accounting firm's consultants are currently doing for the company. Disney in 2000 paid PricewaterhouseCoopers $8.7 million in audit fees and around $32 million in non-audit fees. PricewaterhouseCoopers, for its part, said it intended to spin off its consulting arm in an IPO, which could mollify Disney and others. Arthur Andersen, in 2000, separated from its old consulting arm, now known as Accenture, after a long-running dispute between the two sides of the firm. But since then, Andersen itself has beefed up its own consulting practice. According to a report in The New York Times, just over half the $52 million it billed Enron in 2000 was for consulting.\n",

Top Of The News Dan Ackman, Forbes.com, 02.01.02, 9:26 AM ET \"Divide and conquer\" is often a winning strategy. Enron's wrinkle has long been \"divide and disavow,\" and it seems that, for the bankrupt energy trader and its lawyers, old gambits die hard. One of the principal components of the Enron scandal was the company's practice of creating partnerships and then using them to push its assets or debts off its books. Technically this can be legal, so long as the partnerships are truly separate, which, among other things, means that outside investors control as little as 3% of the partnership equity. The myth of separation--while still strongly believed by Enron itself--is losing support among the accounting firms who have been tainted by Enron and other recent scandals.

It will help them compete on equal terms for global capital,\"Bolkestein said. He added that the legislation would require companies tobegin preparing their consolidated accounts using IAS by 2005.Bolkestein also said he is hopeful that the U.S. Securities and ExchangeCommission will begin to accept financial statements prepared by firms inthe European Union without requiring them to be reconciled with thegenerally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) standard used in the UnitedStates.A major reason that changes are needed in the European Union's financialregulations is because of the \"unprecedented volume of mergers andacquisitions\" between American and European firms.Another reason is that the European Union has established a goal of becoming\"the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world,capable of sustainable growth with more and better jobs, and greater socialcohesion,\" Bolkestein said.Since 1990, Bolkestein said the European community has added 900,000 jobsand has seen improved competition and productivity add 1.5 percent to grossdomestic product growth because of measures taken to create a single marketfor financial services.If the European Union is successful at restructuring its financial system by2005, Bolkestein said he sees other benefits to include a lower cost ofcapital for all companies, a deeper and more vibrant venture capital market,lower costs of purchasing financial products, and higher returns on pensionsand investment funds.To realize those benefits, Bolkestein said the European Commission wouldlike to see an integrated securities market in place by 2003, replacing theindividual domestic securities markets of the European Union's 15 memberstates.\"Mergers and alliances between existing exchanges are already breaking downbarriers, pooling liquidity, reducing clearing costs, decreasing volatility,and increasing transparency,\" Bolkestein said.

Fed's Greenspan Comments on `Egregious' Accounting at Enron2002-01-24 12:40 (New York) Washington, Jan. 24 (Bloomberg) -- The following are comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on accounting practices at Enron Corp. Greenspan's remarks came during the question-and-answer part of testimony to the Senate Budget Committee. ``I think that the extraordinary response to Enron is something I think is very helpful and indeed an indication that the people in this society have required that we maintain a very high standard of trustworthiness in our business operations,'' Greenspan said. ``If everybody did what is alleged in the Enron accounting system, our system could not work,'' he said. ``That is, if you have a system, a market system, it works off information. If you don't have a way to evaluate a particular asset you cannot price it and if you cannot price it you cannot get the appropriate allocation of capital in a market society.'' As to Enron's accounting practices, Greenspan said: ``I think that was an egregious act. I tried as hard as I could to find an economic reason why those affiliates were constructed the way they were. The simplest explanation was the obvious explanation: that they did not want to indicate what their true earnings position was.'' Greenspan said he would be concerned about Enron's practices harming the economy ``if there wasn't a reaction to it.'' ``But the reaction, I think, is going to create a really major rethinking by a lot of people about whether there is a spin game going on with respect to the information coming out of business into the investment community,'' he said. While ``there's been an element of that'' in the past, ``I think there's going to be a good deal less of that. The old issue of competing for reputation is going to re-emerge. And I think you're going to find at some point that there are going to be people out there who are going to say `our accounts you can rely on' and that probably will increase their price-earnings ratios.''--Michael McKee in Washington (202) 624-1895 or mmckee@bloomberg.net.

      "4460 2916 f which were designed 70 years ago, are difficult to apply to today's compl=ex financial transactions. And there is no way, they insist, to prevent sop=histicated fraud. The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (A=ICPA), the industry's professional association, points out that accountants= examine the books of more than 15,000 public companies every year; they ar=e accused of errors in just 0.1% of those audits. But oh, the price of thos=e few failures. Lynn Turner, former chief accountant of the Securities and =Exchange Commission, estimates that investors have lost more than $100 bill=ion because of financial fraud and the accompanying earnings restatements s=ince 1995.=20Perhaps the most glaring example of self-regulation's deficiency has been a=ccountants' unwillingness to deal with conflicts of interest. Over the year=s, the major auditing firms have transformed themselves into \"professional =services\" companies that derive an increasing portion of revenues and profi=ts from consulting: selling computer systems, advising clients on tax shelt=ers, and evaluating their business strategies. In 1999, according to the SE=C, half of the Big Five's revenues came from consulting fees, vs. 13% in 19=81.=20Auditing, meanwhile, has become a commodity. Firms have even been accused o=f using it as a loss leader, a way of getting in the door at a company to s=ell more-profitable consulting contracts. \"Audit work is a marvelous market=ing tool,\" says Lou Lowenstein, a professor emeritus of finance and law at =Columbia University. \"You are already there doing the audit. You say their =internal controls are no good. Well, who are they going to call to fix it?\"= But this requires a firm to work for the public (auditing) and management =(consulting). \"You cannot serve them both,\" says former SEC commissioner Be=vis Longstreth.=20This conflict may have played a role at Enron. Andersen received $25 millio=n in auditing fees from Enron last year. That's money Andersen was paid bot=h as Enron's outside auditor, certifying its financial statements, and as i=ts internal auditor, making sure Enron had the right systems to keep its bo=oks and working to detect fraud and irregularities. This double duty alone =raised a serious potential for conflict. Besides $25 million in accounting =fees, Andersen was paid $23 million for consulting services. \"If you are au=diting your own creations, it is very difficult to criticize them,\" says Ro=bert Willens, a Lehman Brothers tax expert who disapproves of the accountin=g profession's recent move into selling aggressive tax shelters. Andersen h=as not revealed the details of its work on Enron's highly controversial off=-balance-sheet transactions, but the accounting firms have never believed c=onsulting fees compromise their objectivity. \"They have militantly refused =to ever acknowledge the possibility of a problem,\" Longstreth says.\n",

[Fairley, David] The Marketing Strategy, the Trading and Risk Policy, and the Description of Asset Management have been upated. The other Exhibits have not been modified. The Marketing Strategy and Trading & Risk Policy have been discussed at length with MDEA (MDEA commercial, not legal), and their comments/questions incorporated.  7. It would help if theh commercial part of the team could send me the following, in words and/or formulae:The defn and method of establishing the bogey (target production cost) formula can be an exhibit, which would be great for the commercial team to work on. [Fairley, David] Thought we had this covered in the definitions and obligations of the parties. Will look at it again. Conceptually, MDEA, Services Group, and Orig are in full agreement, so we need to make sure that the contract language is clear enough.[Rorschach, Reagan] See attached exhibit detailing the calc with an example. Are we determined how we should deal with imbalances (part of cost of power)? [Fairley, David] There are three considerations on this: (1) who wears imbalance exposure?, (2) who manages imbalances (hourly type activity), and (3) who pays for imbalances? Imbalances are billed by Entergy directly to MDEA under their Network Services Agreement. EPMI's hourly desk manages the load/resource items hourly, but MDEA has the exposure (physical and price) to imbalances. Weather/load changes, and fluctuations in supply create hourly imbalances (they happen, they are uncontrollable, and we fix them) which EPMI's hourly desk manages as part of the imbalance service described in the definitions and obligations of the parties. A different section in the contract states that MDEA wears the exposure. How are we setting the bogey? Formula? [Fairley, David] The bogey is set when the load projection and stack models are run each day. Both parties participate by providing certain necessary info and discussing results and planning the day's activities. [Rorschach, Reagan] Records of bogey decisions will be archievedSubject to audit? [Fairley, David] Yes, but they would be auditing something that is jointly derived each day. Frankly, they would like to have less involvement; ie, they trust us to do it all, but we are requiring them to participate and buy in every day. Two bogeys or one (gas and oil)?[Fairley, David] One bogey for power. Gas is an input for determining the bogey.[Rorschach, Reagan] Bogey set day-ahead.What is defn of profit? I think I have the general idea, but a sentence or two would be helpful as a reality check. [Fairley, David] This is in the pricing calc's. Should we have a definition?\n",

During the discussion, the Andersen executives noted Enron's fees to the firmeventually could total $100 million a year -- an amount that would have madeEnron the accounting firm's biggest client by far. The executives discussedwhether their decision to retain Enron was colored by the size of the fees, andthe memo suggests they were concerned about whether too much of Andersen'sEnron income was coming from nonaudit advisory work. \"Such amounts did nottrouble the participants as long as the nature of the services was not anissue,\" the memo says.  David Tabolt, an Andersen spokesman, said he was unaware of the memo and themeeting it recounts. \"I am unable to provide any comment until I look intothis,\" he said. Accounting firms regularly review clients to determine ifauditing the books puts the accounting firm at risk. The Andersen memo doesn'tspecify if this was one of those regular meetings or if it was called for aparticular reason. Mr. Tabolt stressed that Andersen doesn't hesitate to droprisky clients for various reasons. \"We've dumped thousands of clients in recentyears,\" he said.  The memo was addressed to two Andersen officials, including David Duncan, whoheaded the Enron account and who Andersen this week said it fired foroverseeing the destruction of Enron-related documents after learning thatfederal regulators were examining the energy-trading company's finances.  Mr. Duncan was quizzed at length yesterday by investigators for the HouseEnergy and Commerce Committee and the Justice Department in separate,closed-door sessions. Much of the congressional questions related to theFebruary 2001 memo. Mr. Duncan told the investigators he called the meetingbecause he was aware the Enron account posed \"significant risk,\" according toone person present during the questioning. The memo provided a \"To Do\" listthat included recommending that Enron's board review the fairness oftransactions with the LJM partnership. Asked whether he followed up on that andother items on the list, Mr. Duncan answered \"no\" to most, often suggesting itwas the responsibility of others at the accounting firm.  The second memo, by another Andersen executive, recounts an Aug. 20, 2001,phone conversation with Enron Vice President Sherron Watkins, a former Andersenemployee who that same month alerted Enron Chief Executive Kenneth Lay topossible conflicts of interest and potential accounting irregularities that shefeared could bring the company down.  Congressional aides who have read the memo said it shows that Ms. Watkinsdetailed her concerns about Enron to an Andersen auditor.

Critics= have accused the accounting firm of conflicts of interest because it was E=nron Corp.'s internal and external auditor and did extensive consulting wor=k for the energy-trading company before it filed for bankruptcy-court prote=ction late last year.The announcement that Andersen would limit the scope of services it provide=s to domestic audit clients is in line with similar announcements made in t=he past week by other Big Five accounting firms. Joseph Berardino, Andersen='s chief executive, called the initiatives an important \"first step\" toward= regaining the public's confidence in the Chicago firm's audits.=20On Saturday, a special committee of Enron's board issued a blistering repor=t that, among other things, accused Andersen of failing to perform its prof=essional duties as the auditor. Andersen promptly issued a statement blamin=g the Houston company's collapse on poor business decisions.=20But at a news conference here yesterday, Mr. Berardino ducked reporters' qu=estions about the special committee's report. \"We've had a major letdown in= our whole process,\" Mr. Berardino said. \"It's obvious the public has been =let down, and the question is what should their expectations be.\" Explainin=g why he wouldn't comment on the Enron board's findings, Mr. Berardino said=, \"Today's conversation is about going forward.\"=20In its report released Saturday, a special committee appointed by Enron's b=oard pinned much of the responsibility for Enron's misleading financial rep=orts and eventual collapse on former Enron executives -- and on the company='s board for failing to exercise adequate oversight.

The POB was created in the =late 1970s, when Congress held hearings on a string of audit failures at pu=blic companies that had--much like the recent rash--shaken confidence in th=e major auditing firms. The POB, which has no enforcement power, investigat=es alleged audit failures and oversees a triennial review process in which =the major accounting firms examine one another's procedures. And yet proble=ms persist; arguably, they have grown more acute. \"Is accounting self-regul=ation working? On the face of it, it is not,\" says Representative John Ding=ell, the powerful Michigan Democrat who has long sparred with the accountin=g profession.=20In their defense, the auditors note that current accounting methods, many o=f which were designed 70 years ago, are difficult to apply to today's compl=\n",

Using mark-to-market methods, a company calculates the fair market value of a commodity position - whether it's a contract, an option, a swap, etc. - at the time, even if the value of the position is realized over a longer period. The problem with this method is the actual cash a company realizes from the position might not be the same value the company calculated in its original assessment. Also, sometimes it isn't easy to calculate the fair value of the commodity position. This is particularly true in instances where the market for the commodity isn't liquid. Over time, companies with the highest level of disclosure regarding their mark-to-market gains will most likely trade at higher multiples to counterparts that provide little or no disclosure, said ABN AMRO Inc. analyst Paul Patterson. Encouragingly, it appears companies may already be responding to the call for added disclosure. According to a survey Patterson conducted, more companies with energy trading units were willing to disclose the details of their mark-to-market accounting practices during third-quarter conference calls compared with those in the second quarter. Patterson said he prefers earnings that are cash-based. \"All things being equal, we believe reported earnings that more closely reflect the timely realization of cash have a higher quality associated with them than earnings that do not,\" he said. He expects investors to become smarter and learn to distinguish between earnings growth through accrual accounting and growth fueled by mark-to-market accounting. At the end of the day, it is not a matter of simply producing profits, but being able to say where those earnings came from, said one investor, who manages a pension fund. Some investors also may be placing a greater emphasis on the cash flow the energy merchants produce. Tim O'Brien, portfolio manager of the Gabelli Utilities Fund, said energy merchants that own the physical power assets to back up their trading positions should trade at a premium to an independent power producers and traditional utility companies. Still, the stocks should be valued at less than the growth rate of the company because of their heavy exposures to commodity prices. Energy merchants include companies such as Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) and Dominion Resources Inc. (D). According to O'Brien, the group never deserved to have the price-to-earnings multiples above 20- to 30-times earnings, which were once paid for the stocks. \"We all got sucked up by the up-leg of the cycle and forgot just how cyclical these companies are,\" O'Brien said, adding that the average multiple should be in the high single-digits to the high-teens.\n",

But at the heart of the situation is an accounting technique that allows companies to include as current earnings those profits they expect to realize from energy-related contracts and other derivative instruments in future periods, sometimes stretching over more than 20 years. So-called mark-to-market accounting is mandated by accounting-rule makers when companies have outstanding energy-related contracts on their books at the end of a quarter, such as agreements to sell electricity or buy natural gas over a period of time at certain prices. Under those rules, companies estimate the fair market values of those contracts on their balance sheets each quarter as assets or liabilities. Changes in the value of a contract from quarter to quarter then are either added to or subtracted from net earnings. If, for instance, the market price for natural gas rises above the price specified in a company's contract to buy gas, generally the company will record an unrealized gain. That gain is recognized as income and recorded as an asset on the company's balance sheet. At the end of each quarter, the contract is revalued. The value of the previously recorded asset is increased, and any increase in unrealized gain is recorded as additional income. Conversely, if the market value for gas falls, and the value of the contract has declined, any change in the contract's value is recorded on the company's balance sheet, and a loss is recorded on its income statement. e Yet in their financial reports, the companies only vaguely describe the methods they use to come up with fair-value estimates on the contracts. Increasingly, quoted market prices offering independent guidance are becoming readily available for several years into the future. However, with some long-term derivative instruments, particularly electricity contracts, future market prices don't extend far enough to cover the full life of those contracts. And in those cases, companies are allowed to base valuations on their own undisclosed estimates, assumptions and pricing models. \"Ultimately they're telling you what they think the answer is, but they're not telling you how they got to that answer,\" says Stephen Campbell, an analyst at Business Valuation Services in Dallas. \"That is essentially saying `trust me.'\"\n",

Not only is the article relevant because it apparently caused the stock to dip by $10, but the article elaborates on concerns that apply to a form of accounting that some of our commercial people would like to have apply to our business. I'm not sure the accounting rules would permit mark to market treatment for transport or storage contracts, but it may be appropriate for financial or commodity deals. DF---------------------- Forwarded by Drew Fossum/ET&S/Enron on 09/25/2000 ET & S Business Intelligence DepartmentSubject: The Press Behind the Stock Dip?TEXAS JOURNALEnergy Traders Cite Gains, But Some Math Is MissingBy Jonathan WeilStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal09/20/2000The Wall Street JournalTexas JournalT1(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)Volatile prices for natural gas and electricity are creating high-voltage earnings growth at some companies with large energy-trading units. But investors counting on these gains could be in for a jolt down the road. Shares of these companies have been on a tear lately. And some of the biggest players are in Houston, the center of the energy-trading industry. Dynegy Inc.'s stock is up more than fourfold so far this year at $53.438, and now trades for 41 times what analysts project the company's 2000 earnings will be, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. Shares of Enron Corp., the largest trader of gas and electricity in North America, have nearly doubled this year to $84.875, or 60 times earnings. Meanwhile, El Paso Energy Corp.'s stock has jumped 61% this year to $62.375, or 24 times earnings.Traders at these and other companies are capitalizing on the wild price swings and supply fluctuations that have accompanied deregulation in some regional markets. Natural-gas prices have more than doubled in the past year, while supplies have tightened. And the rapid price fluctuations for electricity have prompted many large businesses to seek price protection through hedging or fixed-price contracts, generating large premiums for traders. But what many investors may not realize is that much of these companies' recent profits constitute unrealized, noncash gains. Frequently, these profits depend on assumptions and estimates about future market factors, the details of which the companies do not provide, and which time may prove wrong. And because of minimal disclosure standards in these kinds of cases, it's difficult for investors to assess whose assumptions might be too aggressive, or what market changes might invalidate the assumptions -- and force earnings revisions.\n",
      "Based on the content of the email, it appears to discuss a Wall Street Journal article that raises concerns about the accounting practices of some energy trading companies, including Enron. The article points out that the profits reported by these companies are largely unrealized and based on estimates and assumptions about future market factors, which may not be realized. The article suggests that investors might be counting on earnings that could be significantly different in the future due to these assumptions potentially being overly optimistic.\n",
      "\n",
      "The email itself does not explicitly state that the accounting practices are fraudulent or that they are hiding losses, but it does highlight the potential for misleading financial reporting due to the use of mark-to-market accounting and the reliance on assumptions. The concerns raised in the article about minimal disclosure standards and the difficulty for investors to assess the validity of these assumptions suggest that there could be a risk of financial statements not fully reflecting the true financial position of the company.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given this context, the email would likely score higher on the scale towards indicating an abuse of accounting rules rather than outright fraud. It is drawing attention to the potential issues with the accounting practices, which could be seen as a red flag for further investigation.\n",

      "4357 2813 John Buckley spoke at a program on derivatives presented by the D.C. BarSection on Taxation Committee on Financial Instruments and Products. Otherspeakers included Mark Price and Steve Rosenthal of KPMG, and Chuck Wheelerof Alston & Bird.Price said Financial Accounting Standard No. 133, adopted in 1998 by theFinancial Accounting Standards Board and amended in June (118 DTR G-7,6/19/00), requires separate accounting for derivatives, using amark-to-market approach like that used under Internal Revenue Code Section475. The new rule requires that any change in the value of the derivative be\"booked\"--included as a gain or loss in determining the company's income forfinancial accounting purposes--even if the company has not disposed of thederivative.The result, Price said, is to create increased volatility in the company'sdetermination of income and loss for accounting purposes. Wheeler said thatcompanies do not want this increased volatility to apply to theirdeterminations of income for tax purposes.Price said the accounting profession adopted new standards for derivativesbecause of numerous problems, including:* incomplete reporting, in that some companies reported no informationor reported information only in a footnote;* inconsistent reporting, in that companies used different rules fordetermining cost and value;* difficulty in applying the accounting rules; and* lack of transparency, in that companies took different approaches intheir treatment of derivatives,meaning income was not determined under the same rules andinformation on financial statements could not be compared with reliability.Issues for Congress to StudyBuckley said the mark-to-market approach is slowly beingadopted in the tax system. He said it was not something he favored acrossthe board but in his view it made sense for the tax system to apply themark-to-market approach to derivatives. He said the problems identified byPrice in accounting for derivatives also applied to the tax system--there isuncertainty and inconsistency.Buckley also said it would simplify recordkeeping to conformthe tax system to the accounting approach, and he favored Congress lookingat this question. He said that Congress's adoption of the mark-to-marketapproach for securities in the early 1990s was the right approach, and hethought that the Financial Accounting Standards Board had taken an\"interesting and important step\" in adopting FAS 133.Buckley said he sees the problem of defining a derivative asa major issue for the tax law, and questioned whether the accountingdefinition was \"workable.\" Other panelists said it is, but Price noted thatthe definition is very fact-specific, and Wheeler said the rules are so newit is too early to tell whether companies will attempt to structuretransactions to use the accounting definition.\n",

He said the problems identified by Price in accounting for derivatives also applied to the tax system--there is uncertainty and inconsistency. Buckley also said it would simplify recordkeeping to conform the tax system to the accounting approach, and he favored Congress looking at this question. He said that Congress's adoption of the mark-to-market approach for securities in the early 1990s was the right approach, and he thought that the Financial Accounting Standards Board had taken an 'interesting and important step' in adopting FAS 133. Buckley said he sees the problem of defining a derivative as a major issue for the tax law, and questioned whether the accounting definition was 'workable.' Other panelists said it is, but Price noted that the definition is very fact-specific, and Wheeler said the rules are so new it is too early to tell whether companies will attempt to structure transactions to use the accounting definition.\",\n",

An Enron spokesman, Vance Meyer, says, \"The accounting error was just that -- an error,\" explaining that, \"We believed it was not material. However, it was, of course, corrected . . . And we did make the correction with Andersen's concurrence.\" He says Andersen \"performed limited quarterly reviews\" of the company's unaudited financial statements and reviewed the entries that resulted in the shareholder-equity overstatements \"to the extent they deemed necessary.\" To some who follow the accounting world closely, this has a familiar ring to it. During the past few years, every Big Five auditor has been hit by multiple accounting debacles at high-profile clients. For Andersen, Enron joins a list including Waste Management Inc. and Sunbeam Corp. While the names of the clients may change, the issues remain largely the same. For instance, Enron had reported net income of $105 million for 1997, a figure that Enron last week said will be reduced to $9 million in its upcoming restatement for that year. Enron said the reduction is mostly because of $51 million in various unexplained \"audit adjustments and reclassifications\" that its auditors had proposed in 1997 but at the time had determined to be \"immaterial.\" Cumulatively, those immaterial adjustments added up to nearly half of Enron's net income for 1997 and now will be included in the company's restatements. That looks a lot like what happened at Sunbeam. According to the SEC's May settlement order with Sunbeam, Andersen auditors had routinely dismissed so many violations of GAAP as immaterial that they eventually piled up to produce significant distortions in Sunbeam's financial statements, making the barely solvent consumer-products maker look handsomely profitable. Sunbeam filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court protection this past February. In May, the SEC filed a civil lawsuit against five former Sunbeam executives and the Andersen partner in charge of the company's audit, accusing them of engaging in a massive financial fraud; all six defendants have denied the SEC's allegations.

The industry is divided in its support for the new panel, said people in the industry. Accounting officials question whether the proposal will be enough to satisfy criticism of the profession in Congress and among consumer groups. Pointing to the 'peer review' system in the accounting industry, critics say self-regulation has been ineffective, as it has never resulted in a negative review of a large accounting firm since its adoption in 1977 -- even though there have been accounting scandals in that period. Before joining the SEC, Mr. Pitt was a top securities lawyer who had represented each of the Big Five and the AICPA. Statements he has made about a 'kinder, gentler' SEC have raised concerns that he wouldn't be a tough regulator. In response, the SEC chairman has recently pressed an agenda to improve disclosure and create better industry oversight aimed at avoiding future Enron-like scandals. Mr. Pitt's ideas mirror recommendations the Big Five requested that the SEC adopt. The firms urged the SEC to issue an interpretive release 'as soon as possible' to improve 2001 annual reports by beefing up disclosure in the management discussion and analysis section of filings. As a short-term fix, the Big Five firms asked the SEC for 'immediate guidance' on disclosing off-balance-sheet transactions, over-the-counter derivatives contracts, and related-party transactions -- three hot-button areas in Enron's debacle. The SEC could approve such guidance in a matter of weeks, which carries the weight of new SEC policy with public companies. Mr. Pitt has intentions of larger-scale changes for requiring material events to be disclosed as they unfold, rather than in quarterly statements that investors read long after events occur. Those changes would require new rules, a process that normally takes at least several months.\",\n",

Until investors conclude it is fixed, though, the market may have to brace for more days like yesterday. In addition to the declines in the Dow Jones industrials, the broad Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 2.86%, or 32.42 points. The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 2.62%, or 50.92 points, to 1892.99, leaving it down 3% for the year. In a sign of how much times have changed, the normally staid banking group fell far harder yesterday than technology stocks, which ordinarily are the market's most volatile group.\",\n",

But many critics say disclosure issues of a different sort dog the financial statements of most companies that trade electricity, natural gas, and the like -- with the approval of the nation's accounting-rule makers. At issue is a technique called 'mark to market' accounting, under which the Financial Accounting Standards Board has given energy traders wide discretion to include as current earnings those profits they expect to realize in future periods from energy-related contracts and other derivative instruments. For many energy-trading companies, significant chunks of earnings in recent years have come from recording unrealized, noncash gains through such accounting entries. Often, these profits depend on assumptions and estimates about future market factors, details of which the companies don't provide. And because of the minimal disclosure standards, it is difficult for investors to assess whose assumptions might be too aggressive, or what market changes might invalidate the assumptions -- and force earnings revisions. 'Whenever there's a considerable amount of discretion that companies have in reporting their earnings,' says ABN Amro analyst Paul Patterson, who follows energy-trading firms, 'one gets concerned that some companies may overstate those earnings in certain situations where they feel pressure to make earnings goals.' Mark-to-market accounting is required whenever companies have outstanding energy-related contracts on their balance sheets, either as assets or liabilities, at the end of a quarter. For example, these could be agreements to sell electricity or buy natural gas over time at certain prices. Under the rules, companies estimate the fair values of the contracts. Quarterly changes in value -- representing unrealized, noncash gains and losses -- then are run through the companies' income statements. One way to gauge the size of some companies' past unrealized gains is to dig through their cash-flow statements, which sometimes specify the noncash portion of trading gains. At Enron, unrealized trading gains accounted for slightly more than half of the company's $1.41 billion of originally reported pretax profit in 2000 and about a third of its originally reported pretax profit of $1.13 billion in 1999. At Dynegy, unrealized gains accounted for nearly half its $762 million in 2000 pretax profit and about half its $227 million in 1999 pretax profit.

      "4080 2536 Bad trading. Enron's main technique to pump up earnings probably revolvedaround a loose-as-a-goose process for the accounting of energy derivatives.Called mark-to-market, the technique involves evaluating contracts at \"fairvalue\" prices. Since some of these contracts stretched out for 20 years, thefutures market provides no firm prices. And, absent a liquid market withclear prices, \"fair value\" becomes a mug's game in which companies canvastly inflate value. These overstated gains, of course, were also unrealized, noncash gains. InSeptember 2000, Jonathan Weil, a reporter for the Journal, took a look atEnron's second quarter and found that absent noncash earnings, Enron wouldhave had a loss. Mr. Weil later found that for the year as a whole,unrealized trading gains accounted for more than half of the company'soriginally reported pretax profits. Hardly a confidence-builder in thequality of Enron's earnings.When their derivative strategies started to go sour, this theory runs, Enronremoved the contracts from its financial statements and hid them in specialentities created for just that purpose.Bad Assets. Another theory locates Enron's earning problems in their hardassets. Enron had a bunch of huge and underperforming assets, like itsbroadband company, water company and power plants in India and Brazil. Inorder to hustle those assets and associated debts off its financial reports,the company created some limited partnerships to buy these dogs -- eitherwith bank loans or money provided by Enron itself. These partnerships(allegedly) transferred enough control to third parties to get them offEnron's balance sheet. Enron guaranteed these deals with \"make good\" provisions backed by Enronstock -- a promise that Enron would make good any losses in the value of thepartnerships. When the value of the assets tanked, the make-good provisionskicked in, resulting, for example, in the enormous write-down in shareholderequity in November.Depending on which theory one accepts, there are two bottom lines.The first holds that the sagging earnings problem was fatal and that it isentirely possible Enron was in the process of liquidating itself. Jim Chanosof Kynikos Associates hypothesizes that Enron's cost of capital was higherthan its returns on invested capital. A second argues that if Enron'smanagers had been content to accept the fact that in competitive marketstheir \"first mover\" advantage was going to be competed away, and had beenwilling to endure slower earnings growth, it would not be in bankruptcytoday.\n",

      "4377 2833 The significance of special charges -- whether they represent old baggage from the past or illuminate the future -- is at the center of a lively debate under way in the accounting world. One side holds that generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, provide the best available snapshot of a company's financial position. GAAP, which companies must use in their official financial statements, requires that nearly all charges be treated as ordinary expenses. Others, including many stock analysts, contend the best view comes from \"pro forma\" financial results -- calculated \"as if\" many expenses didn't really exist. The idea is that these expenses aren't relevant to future performance. Companies increasingly highlight the pro forma view in news releases they generally put out before their official filings with regulators. But pro forma calculations adhere to no particular standard. Companies essentially do what they want. Now, accountants and economists say the practice of excluding blemishes is so widespread that companies and analysts often guide investors to dismiss charges that contain prescient warnings -- like the one at Bethlehem Steel. Ms. Applebaum, the Salomon Smith Barney analyst who played down Bethlehem's big write-off, explains that she has covered other steel companies that returned to profitability shortly after writing off deferred tax assets. She thought Bethlehem would do the same. She notes that GAAP rules on such assets obliged Bethlehem to follow strict criteria in assessing its chances of future profitability -- stricter criteria than stock analysts typically use. As for Bethlehem, Chief Financial Officer Leonard M. Anthony says the charge the company took was to some extent \"predictive of the future.\" GAAP also has well-established standards for writing down other kinds of assets. Companies must reduce the value on their books of anything from a customer loan to a manufacturing plant when its worth has diminished. Again, Wall Street stock analysts tend to dismiss the resulting charges as one-time events. Sometimes that makes sense. During the 1981-82 recession, restructuring was a part of many corporations' strategies. They took charges for streamlining, outsourcing and otherwise shedding costs to position themselves for recovery. Because the resulting earnings volatility made it hard to compare companies' growth rates or price-earnings ratios, and because the charges weren't expected to recur, there was logic to excluding them to come up with \"smoothed\" earnings trends. \"Investors came to look upon the charges, correctly in many cases, as evidence that those firms had recognized past mistakes and had made tough decisions to become more efficient,\" said a September 2001 study by the Jerome Levy Economics Institute at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y.\n",

      "3899 2355 CHICAGO, Jan. 2 /PRNewswire/ -- Andersen today announced that its system of accounting and auditing quality has been deemed to provide reasonable assurance of compliance with professional standards, following the most extensive peer review in the firm's history. Deloitte & Touche's report, which includes an unmodified opinion for the review year ended August 31, 2001, has been accepted by the Peer Review Committee of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' (AICPA) SEC Practice and is available at the AICPA, http://www.aicpa.org/members/div/secps/index.htm . Every three years since 1978, major accounting firms, under the oversight of the Public Oversight Board (POB), have been engaged to conduct reviews of the accounting and auditing practices of member firms in the AICPA SEC Practice Section (SECPS). The scope of this year's peer review of Andersen was expanded after financial reporting issues emerged at Enron Corp. Andersen requested, and Deloitte & Touche had separately concluded, that expanded procedures were appropriate. Deloitte & Touche independently determined the scope of the expanded peer review procedures.In total, the peer and Andersen's internal practice review covered 240 Andersen audit engagements in over 30 Andersen offices and the Andersen national office. The engagements reviewed by Deloitte & Touche reviewers and Andersen practice review teams involved some 45 percent of Andersen's U.S. audit partners. The engagements selected for review represented a cross-section of Andersen's accounting and auditing practice with emphasis on higher-risk engagements. It included examining working paper files and reports and interviewing engagement personnel. Deloitte & Touche's opinion was \"unmodified,\" without qualification.

      " {\"email_text\":\"CHICAGO, Jan. 2 /PRNewswire/ -- Andersen today announced that its system of accounting and auditing quality has been deemed to provide reasonable assurance of compliance with professional standards, following the most extensive peer review in the firm's history. Deloitte & Touche's report, which includes an unmodified opinion for the review year ended August 31, 2001, has been accepted by the Peer Review Committee of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' (AICPA) SEC Practice and is available at the AICPA, http://www.aicpa.org/members/div/secps/index.htm . Every three years since 1978, major accounting firms, under the oversight of the Public Oversight Board (POB), have been engaged to conduct reviews of the accounting and auditing practices of member firms in the AICPA SEC Practice Section (SECPS). The scope of this year's peer review of Andersen was expanded after financial reporting issues emerged at Enron Corp. Andersen requested, and Deloitte & Touche had separately concluded, that expanded procedures were appropriate. Deloitte & Touche independently determined the scope of the expanded peer review procedures.In total, the peer and Andersen's internal practice review covered 240 Andersen audit engagements in over 30 Andersen offices and the Andersen national office. The engagements reviewed by Deloitte & Touche reviewers and Andersen practice review teams involved some 45 percent of Andersen's U.S. audit partners. The engagements selected for review represented a cross-section of Andersen's accounting and auditing practice with emphasis on higher-risk engagements. It included examining working paper files and reports and interviewing engagement personnel. Deloitte & Touche's opinion was \"unmodified,\" without qualification. However, three issues not deemed significant enough to affect the opinion were raised in an attached comment letter. Such comments are not unusual in peer review reports. The comments related to: documentation of certain auditing procedures on some engagements; communications with audit committees in some instances; and management representation letters that needed more tailoring in some instances. In its response to Deloitte & Touche's comments, Andersen said it had taken, or would take, the steps recommended to improve its accounting and auditing practices.\"}\n",

      "Based on the provided email content, which discusses the business model of Enron's origination and trading outfit and emphasizes the importance of trading controls and non-negotiable compliance, the following analysis can be made:\n",
      "\n",
      "The email does not explicitly indicate an abuse of accounting rules or outright fraud. It primarily focuses on operational procedures, the necessity of trading controls, and the importance of having these controls adhered to by all parties involved. The emphasis on \"trading controls [being] non-negotiable\" suggests that the company is aware of and intends to comply with regulatory requirements.\n",

      "However, the context of the Enron scandal, where similar discussions about operational procedures were used to hide losses through complex accounting practices, raises concerns. The absence of accountants, middle office people, or other humans in the sales office, as mentioned in the email, could be a red flag for potential bypassing of internal controls that are typically in place to prevent financial manipulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given this context, the email does not directly show an intention to commit fraud or hide losses, but it does raise questions about the robustness of internal controls and the potential for such practices to be used if desired. Therefore, while the email itself does not score high on a scale of 0 to 10 for indicating outright fraud (0 being no abuse and 10 being outright fraud), it does warrant further investigation into the actual implementation and enforcement of these controls.\n",

But we can't stop at Arthur Andersen. The real \"values\" crisis represented by the Enron mess is far deeper, and stretches across our economy. We are all being victimized by it, and the situation is growing ever worse. It is the great unreported business story of our time: the growing failure of the accounting system to accurately capture what is going in the new hyperspeed economy. Simply put, we have no idea what any company is worth today. The accounting industry is mired in a system that was devised 600 years ago and has only been fine-tuned ever since. It doesn't work any more. Accountants know it, corporate executives know it, and the stock market knows it. The general recognition of this fact has led to a widespread ethical sloppiness made manifest in such things as Arthur Andersen's apparent conflict. The reality is that the only time anybody really checks an audit anymore is after a financial disaster like Enron, when scapegoats must be found. Rear-View Mirror Accounting I once likened traditional accounting to driving a car by only looking in the rear view mirror. It can tell you where a company has recently been, but it is unable to tell you where that company is now. And in a world in which change occurs in nanoseconds, such obsolete data is worthless. Today, events arrive so swiftly, and change so constant, that it is no longer even enough to operate in the present. Modern business now runs in the future. The result is a growing gap between traditional \"book\" value and actual market value - and through that gap drives not only companies like Enron, but truly valuable firms like General Electric and Intel. Traditional accounting has long dealt with that gap through a line entry entitled \"goodwill.\" But it was typically only added when a company sold for more than the total value of its inventory, buildings, etc. At most, this goodwill only represented a few percent of the total value. That was then. In the modern economy, for great, fast moving, innovative young companies this so-called \"goodwill\" can represent 90 percent of their value. When a corporate audit can only tell us about ten percent of a company, what the hell is the point? There have been a number of efforts in recent years to come up with innovative new ways to determine corporate value, many of them under the all-encompassing terms \"intellectual capital\" or \"intangible assets\". But they are still in their earliest stages, and most slam up against the formidable wall of the traditional accounting industry.\n",

WASHINGTON, Nov 19 (Reuters) - A U.S. Congressman has called for an investigation of Big Five accounting firm Arthur Andersen LLP in connection with its audits of Enron Corp. and Waste Management Inc., according to a letter released on Monday. Turning up the heat under the conflict-of-interest issue among the world's largest bean-counters, Rep. John Dingell asked the Public Oversight Board for 'an oversight review or special investigation of Arthur Andersen LLP,' said the letter made available to Reuters. Dingell also asked the board to look into peer reviews of Arthur Andersen conducted in recent years by other accounting firms, including Deloitte & Touche, and questioned the value of a triennial peer review process in place since 1978. 'The best accounting standards in the world are meaningless if the accounting and audit processes are so inept or corrupt that they produce unreliable numbers and untruthful reporting,' wrote Dingell, a Michigan Democrat, in the letter. 'I request that POB's investigation or review include adequate, transparent and public disclosure of all significant issues identified,' Dingell wrote. As accounting has consolidated into fewer and larger firms with more lines of business from auditing to consulting, it has come under increasing fire on the conflict-of-interest issue. The Dingell letter is only the latest in a continuing barrage of criticism leveled in recent years at Big Five firms. Arthur Andersen, based in Chicago, was auditor to Houston energy trading giant Enron, rocked in recent weeks by a Securities and Exchange Commission probe of certain outside partnership deals involving company officers. Enron's stock price has plunged, several managers have resigned, and numerous shareholder lawsuits are pending. Enron earlier this month said it planned to be bought out by rival Dynegy Inc. Critics have said Arthur Andersen should have done more as Enron's auditor to draw investors' attention to its unusual finances. A lawsuit filed in Oregon alleged Arthur Andersen's judgment was swayed by lucrative consulting fees that it was collecting from Enron while it was also being paid as auditor. ANDERSEN SAYS CONFIDENT IN PROCESS Responding to Dingell, Andersen spokesman David Tabolt said accounting firm's must report litigation involving allegations of audit failures within 30 days to a committee of the SEC's practice section, which the Public Oversight Board oversees. 'Under the profession's self-regulatory processes, which the POB oversees, the committee is responsible for conducting an inquiry to determine whether the matters that are the subject of litigation indicate systemic quality control problems that need to be addressed either by the firm involved or by the profession,' Tabolt said.\",\n",

The res=ult is total confusion. Take earnings per share for the Standard & Poor's 50=00-stock index for the second quarter. Under Thomson Financial/First Call's standards, it is $11.82. But it's $9.02 according to S&P and $4.83 under GAA=P. How can investors make intelligent decisions?=20The Financial Accounting Standards Board clearly is failing to do its job. =It has promised to write a set of rules that calculates operating earnings and relates them to net earnings, but it hasn't delivered. The rating agency Standard & Poor's (owned by The McGraw-Hill Companies, as is BusinessWeek=) is doing a better job. It recently drew up a definition of 'operating earnings' that includes restructuring costs (including severance), writedowns from ongoing operations, and the cost of stock options. It excludes merge and acquisition expenses, litigation settlements, impairment of goodwill,= and gains or losses on asset sales. This is a beginning that FASB should b=uild on. The accounting anarchy has to end.\",\n",

      "4303 2759 LONDON -(Dow Jones)- Issues bedeviling the accounting profession for years have finally flashed into the headlines, thanks to Enron and the bursting of the Internet bubble.Unhappily, most are unlikely to be solved anytime soon. Questions of auditor independence and the use of pro forma statements are at the fore. Not far behind are ones on accounting for options and goodwill. And then there's the issue of which standards to use. Right now, \"who guards the guardians\" has leapfrogged to the top of the agenda. The Enron collapse shows that auditors need to be more independent. It's a thinly-disguised fiction that auditors are paid by and act on behalf of shareholders. Clearly, it's corporate management doing the hiring and firing of auditors. And audit itself makes little profit. Instead, accountants rely on consulting and more technical or specialized practices, like M&A, to generate fees. An accountant refusing to pass a company's results runs the risk of losing a big part of his own business. Even the risk of litigation isn't - or at least hasn't been pre-Enron - enough of a deterrent. What's the solution? Make sure companies that audit aren't swayed by conflicts of interest. Regulators should either encourage stand-alone audit firms or prohibit auditors from any other involvement with the companies they scrutinize - even if that's tricky for big international corporations, which can use all of the \"big five\" accounting firms in the course of a year's global dealings. Another dilemma is the issue of pro formas. There's a mounting consensus that pro forma statements are suspect. According to some estimates, pro forma results for S&P 500 companies during the third quarter overstated audited profits by 70%. Why should companies push their pro formas when, after all, there's a perfectly good U.S. audited accounting standard: the U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)? Enron notwithstanding, surveys show investors are more confident with U.S. corporate results than those from Europe or Japan. And yet, U.S. GAAP has its own problems. U.S. accounting is rigidly based on rules, unlike elsewhere, where it's more a case of applying broad principles. Though these rules are designed to ensure standards, they're often subverted by loopholes. U.S. companies can comply with the letter of the law but still offer a distorted picture of fundamentals. The result is that while investors are flooded with information, it's not always helpful in determining a company's value. Enron highlighted one such loophole. The company went under in large part because it was taking on huge, unseen liabilities. These liabilities weren't on the balance sheet, having been planted on special vehicles nominally independent of the firm.\n",

Using so-called gain-on-sale accounting (a form of mark-to-market accounting), those lenders booked earnings from loans as soon as they were made, rather than having to wait for them to be paid off, as banks typically do.   But as interest rates fell in 1998, many customers paid off their loans earlier than expected, slashing lenders' profit margins.

France's state-owned electricity company would gain 150,000gas and electricity customers, mainly in the U.K., with theacquisition of Enron Direct. It is talking toPricewaterhouseCoopers about a purchase, said a spokesman forElectricite de France, who declined to be named. ``Enron Direct would fit well with our London Electricitybusiness,'' Gerard Wolf, director of the chairman's office for theFrench company, told Reuters earlier. Enron, the biggest energy trader, is trying to survivehistory's biggest Chapter 11 reorganization. It's lining up a $1.5billion loan, getting permission to spend money to keep operatingand firing 4,000 workers. Centrica Plc and Innogy Holdings Plc of the U.K, TXU Corp.and RWE AG, Germany's No. 2 utility, are also interested in buyingEnron Direct, said Reuters, without citing a source.--Brooke Nelson in the Madrid newsroom (34 91) 700-9602, orEnron Lines Up $1.5 Billion in Bankruptcy Financing (Update5)2001-12-03 21:02 (New York)Enron Lines Up $1.5 Billion in Bankruptcy Financing (Update5)\n",

      "4484 2940 rofessor Mark T. Bradshaw found that companies are increasingly calling the=se charges unusual. That gives them a rationale for excluding them from the=ir pro forma calculations.=20Lots of critics disagree, saying such charges are often an inevitable part =of the business cycle and should be reflected in a company's earnings histo=ry. They certainly should not be ignored by investors. ``Charges are real s=hareholder wealth that's been lost,'' argues David W. Tice, manager of the =Prudent Bear Fund, a mutual fund with a pessimistic bent that's up 17% so f=ar this year. ``It's money they spent on something no longer worth what it =was, a correction of past earnings, or a reserve for costs moving forward. =Whatever the reason, it's a real cost to the company, and that hurts shareh=olders.'' Without standards, excessive write-offs from operating earnings c=an obscure actual performance. Without any rules, companies calculate opera=ting earnings inconsistently in order to put their companies in the best po=ssible light. Dell Computer Corp. is a good example of this ``heads I win, =tails you lose'' school of accounting. For years, Dell benefited from gains= in its venture-capital investments and was happy to include those gains in= its reported earnings, where they appeared as a separate line on the incom=e statement. But this year, when those gains turned to losses, the computer= maker issued pro forma numbers that excluded that $260 million drag. Dell =spokesman Michael Maher says the company's press releases and SEC filings b=reak out investment income and give GAAP numbers as well as pro forma. ``In= our view, the numbers are reported clearly,'' says Maher. ``It's all out t=here for the consuming public.'' PAST PUFFERY. Many experts believe special= charges are a sign that past performance was exaggerated. What should inve=stors make of a company such as Gateway Inc.? Two restructuring charges in =the first and third quarters, minus a small extraordinary gain, totaled $1.=12 billion, or about $100 million more than the company made in 1998, 1999,= and 2000 combined. Which is the truer picture of its performance and poten=tial? The write-offs or the earnings? Write-offs for customer financing are= another example. When Nortel increased its reserves for credit extended to= customers by $767 million in September, it effectively admitted it had boo=ked sales in the past to companies that couldn't pay--in effect overstating= its performance in those earlier periods. In addition, Nortel says booking= sales and accounting for credit are unrelated issues. Tech companies blame= the sharp downturn in their industry for the big write-offs. And these are=n't isolated examples. Peter L. Bernstein, publisher of newsletter Economic=s & Portfolio Strategy, found that from 1989 to 1993, 20% of earnings vanis=hed into write-offs.=20Big charge-offs can also distort future performance. Critics contend that e=\n",

That gives them a rationale for excluding them from their pro forma calculations.=20Lots of critics disagree, saying such charges are often an inevitable part =of the business cycle and should be reflected in a company's earnings history. They certainly should not be ignored by investors. ``Charges are real shareholder wealth that's been lost,'' argues David W. Tice, manager of the Prudent Bear Fund, a mutual fund with a pessimistic bent that's up 17% so far this year. ``It's money they spent on something no longer worth what it =was, a correction of past earnings, or a reserve for costs moving forward. =Whatever the reason, it's a real cost to the company, and that hurts shareholders.'' Without standards, excessive write-offs from operating earnings can obscure actual performance. Without any rules, companies calculate operating earnings inconsistently in order to put their companies in the best possible light. Dell Computer Corp. is a good example of this ``heads I win, tails you lose'' school of accounting. For years, Dell benefited from gains in its venture-capital investments and was happy to include those gains in its reported earnings, where they appeared as a separate line on the income statement. But this year, when those gains turned to losses, the computer maker issued pro forma numbers that excluded that $260 million drag. Dell spokesman Michael Maher says the company's press releases and SEC filings break out investment income and give GAAP numbers as well as pro forma.\",\n",

Curve Management ProcessThe markets in which our merchanting division trades are based on the LME curves but are linked to a large number of basis curves for quality and location. Given the vast number we have opted to break down the markets by brand group and port location. E.G. for Copper this means we have a grid with 5 brand groups and 3 sets of port groups (13 for europe, 7 for the US and 6 for the Far East). The maintaince & price testing of the grids is made manageable by the fact the premiums only need be entered for brand and port groups by the traders yet prices can be tested by reference to node points i.e. price of specific brand at a given location which can be checked to a market quote.5.

      "4520 2976 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- There may one good thing that comes out of the Enron Corp. (ENE) financial mess - stricter accounting rules governing consolidation of financial results.Enron acknowledged earlier Thursday that it incorrectly accounted for its relationships with related partnerships by keeping them off its financial statements. It corrected that mistake by consolidating the partnerhips into its results, a move that led Enron to restate three years worth of earnings, lowering them by a collective $586 million. Under current accounting regulations, companies don't have to consolidate loss or income from entities in which they have an interest below 51%, keeping those losses or gains off their books (the balance sheets and income statements). The Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, has been working on a project that would replace the standard of ownership by a more encompassing one of control. But that project has been languishing since 1982 when the board first started considering the issue. \"This is an area where FASB is struggling\" to set new criteria, said Alan Bromberg, a professor of corporate and securities law at the Dedeman School of Law of The Southern Methodist University. FASB has struggled in part because companies were fighting the changes and it has had difficulty in defining control to mean something other than majority ownership. The Enron's restatement and consolidation is also focusing attention on another arcane accounting rule, one dealing with minimum ownership by unaffiliated outsiders. Under a statement made by the Securities and Exchange Commission during an Emerging Issue Task Force meeting over a decade ago, the SEC stated that a minimum outside investment was needed for the special purpose entity to qualify for non consolidation. This guideline has remained in effect ever since. According to EITF documents dated 1989 and 1990, a minimum outside investment of 3% or more in a special purpose entity may be necessary, depending on the credit risk, for it to qualify for non-consolidation status. Given that some of the special entities created by Enron were controlled by some of its former executives, experts said it's possible that the SEC was considering the outside ownership of these entities insufficient for them to qualify for non consolidation. Meanwhile, it's unclear how Arthur Andersen LLP, Enron's independent auditor since the late 1980s, will be affected by the company's restatement and recent financial turmoil. A spokesman for Arthur Andersen said his firm \"continues to cooperate with Enron and its special committee to bring a resolution to this matter.\" The accounting giant has had some recent run-ins with shareholders and regulators because of accounting issues. It recently agreed to pay $110 million to settle a shareholder lawsuit over audits it conducted for Sunbeam Corp. Sunbeam had been accused of overstating its revenues and subsequently went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\n",

None of the c=ompanies have felt heat anywhere approaching that of energy-trading firm En=ron Corp., which filed for bankruptcy-court protection late last year short=ly after restating its earnings going back four years by more than $500 mil=lion. But questions have swirled about the financial statements of some of =the telecom companies, many of which achieved spectacular growth rates only= to see their valuations crater in last year's stock-market decline.Some of that spectacular growth came by immediately recognizing revenue fro=m one-time, long-term contracts, rather than phasing it in gradually over t=he life of the arrangements. The biggest questions have centered on Qwest, =of Denver. A Morgan Stanley report last spring contended the company tried =to boost its earnings through certain accounting moves related to its merge=r with U S West. Qwest denied it did anything wrong but disclosed that the =Securities and Exchange Commission had raised questions about its merger ac=counting.

The topic of intangibles was thesubject of extended debate among FASB's seven members as they weighed itsimportance in allocating staff resources to such a project or to two otherissues vying for the attention of rulemakers. FASB heard arguments from one board member, John Wulff, suggesting that aneffort to simplify and codify standards and other guidance that formstatements of generally accepted principles, together with writing standardson revenue recognition and defining liability, may be more suitablecandidates for rulemaking. Major U.S. corporations, through at least onetrade group, the Institute of Management Accountants, counseled the coursedescribed by Wulff, a former leader of Financial Executive International'sCommittee on Corporate Reporting. That committee opposes FASB's taking onthe performance reporting and intangibles projects as outlined in aprospectus issued about two months ago. FASB settled on a compromise plan offered by board Chairman Edmund Jenkins.In the compromise, the panel's staff will carry out further preparatory workon intangible assets. At the same time, FASB's staff will study the threepotential projects--revenue recognition and liability definition,simplification and codification of accounting rules, and disclosures aboutintangibles--with an eye toward deciding an appropriate use of staffaccountants' time. The additional work on intangibles is to focus onsummarizing existing research on such non-concrete assets as in-processresearch and development, patents, and customer lists, with particular focuson questions about what information on intangibles is useful to investors,security analysts, and other users of financial statements. FASB would notcarry out polling or surveys, the board emphasized. The board tentativelyset a deadline of Dec. 24 for completion of the two-pronged work by itsstaff. That timetable would suggest FASB plans to make a more definitivedecision on adding a second, or even a third, standard-setting project inearly 2002.\n",

      "4297 2753 01/03/2002Chicago TribuneNorth Sports Final ; N3(Copyright 2002 by the Chicago Tribune)Accounting firm Andersen said Wednesday that its auditing practice responsible for checking the books of bankrupt energy trader Enron Corp. has been given a clean bill of health in a peer review by another accounting firm, but some observers criticized the findings. The review, performed by rival Big Five firm Deloitte & Touche, was part of an assessment carried out once every three years to check the quality of financial reporting of top firms.Andersen's accounting systems were \"deemed to provide reasonable assurance of compliance with professional standards,\" according to a statement from the Chicago-based firm. \"Deloitte's opinion was unmodified, without qualification,\" for the year ended Aug. 31, Andersen added. But the integrity of the process was criticized almost immediately by analysts, including professor Lynn Turner, a former Securities and Exchange Commission chief accountant and current director of the Center for Quality Financial Reporting at Colorado State University. \"If the process was really credible, I don't think we'd be having the rash of problems we are having today,\" Turner said. Turner cited reporting problems that have cost investors billions of dollars at Enron, such other Andersen clients as Waste Management Inc. and Sunbeam Corp., and similar high-profile failures at Cendant Corp., Rite Aid Corp. and MicroStrategy Inc. after audits by other accounting firms. Critics of the peer review process point to the fact that since the cooperative assessments began in 1978, no Big Five accounting firm has received a qualified opinion of its accounting procedures from a rival. When Enron filed for bankruptcy protection in December, it was Andersen's Houston office's largest client. The energy trader's collapse is the subject of a SEC investigation, lawsuits and a number of congressional probes. According to Deloitte's letter of comment, which accompanied the unqualified opinion, Andersen was told about a need to improve minor documentation and communication problems. Andersen's peer review was all but complete when it asked in November for the review to be expanded to include the Houston office responsible for auditing Enron, which had disclosed financial reporting problems that led to $1.2 billion being chopped from shareholders' equity. The assessment did not look specifically at the audit Andersen performed on Enron, because there is \"pending litigation\" over reporting problems, according to Deloitte's letter.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The deals, which were structured so they wouldn't show up on Enron's balance sheet, caused Enron to chop almost $600 million off earnings for the last four years. The once-mighty company lost $20 billion in market value, and on Friday agreed to be bought by smaller rival Dynegy Inc. Investors are scared of such stock market casualties. That's partly why they want to crack down on pro-forma numbers, which often present a much rosier picture of a company's performance because they exclude a whole bevy of costs that drag down the bottom line.\",\n",

Brushing up on a basic accounting textbook might have helped, some critics say. Confirming investors' fears, the Houston energy trader Thursday filed a lengthy disclosure document with the Securities and Exchange Commission declaring that its financial statements going back to 1997 \"should not be relied upon\" and will have to be restated. Among other problems, Enron acknowledged overstating its net income by a total of $586 million, or 20%. Enron's financial statements long have been widely assailed as indecipherable. Now, it turns out, they were just plain wrong.But what is most striking about the latest disclosures is that they show Enron's misstatements weren't limited merely to judgment calls and gray areas for the green-eyeshade crowd to debate. Portions of Enron's accounting practices amounted to violations of elementary accounting principles, some accounting specialists say. Citing client-confidentiality rules, an Andersen spokesman, David Tabolt, declines to comment on his firm's work for Enron, which on Friday agreed to be bought by crosstown rival Dynegy. He calls Enron's disavowal of its previous financial statements an \"unfortunate situation\" and says Andersen is cooperating with the SEC's Enron investigation and the special committee formed by Enron to investigate the company's accounting and disclosure practices. Consider the primary reason for the $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity that Enron revealed in mid-October, sparking much of the downdraft in the company's shares. At the time, Enron said the reduction came about because it had decided to unwind certain transactions with some limited partnerships with which it had done business. On Thursday, however, Enron acknowledged that the original accounting for the transactions violated generally accepted accounting principles. Starting in early 2000, the company said last week, Enron issued shares of its own common stock to four \"special-purpose entities,\" in exchange for which it received a note receivable. Enron said it had increased both its note-receivable assets and shareholder equity, a move the company called \"an accounting error\" that it is correcting. Under GAAP, the payment a company receives when issuing stock only counts as equity if it is cash. As a result, Enron's 2000 audited financial statements overstated the company's notes-receivable assets and shareholder equity by $172 million. And Enron's 2001 unaudited statements overstated them by $828 million. The $1 billion overstatement represents 8.5% of Enron's previously reported shareholder equity as of June 30.\n",

Lord Wakeham has said he will= remain on leave until he has cleared his name in the U.S. investigation in=to Enron.=20As in the U.S., the question of political donations from Enron has been rai=sed in the U.K., with the opposition Conservative Party charging that GBP 3=8,000 ($61,000) in Enron donations to the ruling Labour Party in 1997 to 20=00 may have influenced the government to end a moratorium on the constructi=on of gas-fired power stations.

They asked him to declare that his company, Emaar Properties PJSC, had no off-the-books partnerships or off-balance-sheet debts. While Mr. Alabbar was ready to sign a document pledging that was the case right away, the auditors told him to take the document home for a couple of days and think about it first. The collapse of Enron Corp. has led global markets to retrench in fear of widespread accounting irregularities, forced at least one foreign official to resign, and focused attention on local accounting scandals. It also has prompted a rethink of accounting practices from Britain to the UAE to South Africa. In many ways, the Houston company's bankruptcy is being treated like a fault has been found in a critical airplane system, prompting a scramble to effect global repairs.\",\n",

Enron's wrinkle has long been \"divide and disavow,\" and it seems that, for the bankrupt energy trader and its lawyers, old gambits die hard. One of the principal components of the Enron scandal was the company's practice of creating partnerships and then using them to push its assets or debts off its books. Technically this can be legal, so long as the partnerships are truly separate, which, among other things, means that outside investors control as little as 3% of the partnership equity. The myth of separation--while still strongly believed by Enron itself--is losing support among the accounting firms who have been tainted by Enron and other recent scandals. The Big Five accounting firms are coming around to the idea that providing certain consulting services to the same company it is auditing creates an inherent conflict and is bad business. Until recently, the accounting profession bitterly opposed any limits on its consulting services, beating back rule changes proposed by Arthur Levitt when he was chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. But the Enron taint has spread past Enron's own auditor, Arthur Andersen, and the firms are seeking to police themselves lest others--such as the SEC--do it for them. PricewaterhouseCoopers and KPMG said yesterday said they would support such proposals. Andersen itself is said to be leaning in that direction and that it will soon announce substantial changes in how it does business. The Walt Disney Co. approved of the new regime of separation yesterday when its chairman, Michael Eisner, said the company would not use its independent auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers, for any new consulting work and would evaluate the current projects the accounting firm's consultants are currently doing for the company. Disney in 2000 paid PricewaterhouseCoopers $8.7 million in audit fees and around $32 million in non-audit fees. PricewaterhouseCoopers, for its part, said it intended to spin off its consulting arm in an IPO, which could mollify Disney and others. Arthur Andersen, in 2000, separated from its old consulting arm, now known as Accenture, after a long-running dispute between the two sides of the firm. But since then, Andersen itself has beefed up its own consulting practice. According to a report in The New York Times, just over half the $52 million it billed Enron in 2000 was for consulting.\n",

      "4417 2873 In a speech at the American Enterprise Institute, Bolkestein reaffirmed theEuropean Union's commitment to requiring all E.U.-based companies to use theInternational Accounting Standards (IAS) practices in their record keepingin order to enhance transparency and provide higher quality financialinformation to investors across the world.\"The use of one global accounting language will greatly benefit Europeancompanies. It will help them compete on equal terms for global capital,\"Bolkestein said. He added that the legislation would require companies tobegin preparing their consolidated accounts using IAS by 2005.Bolkestein also said he is hopeful that the U.S. Securities and ExchangeCommission will begin to accept financial statements prepared by firms inthe European Union without requiring them to be reconciled with thegenerally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) standard used in the UnitedStates.A major reason that changes are needed in the European Union's financialregulations is because of the \"unprecedented volume of mergers andacquisitions\" between American and European firms.Another reason is that the European Union has established a goal of becoming\"the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world,capable of sustainable growth with more and better jobs, and greater socialcohesion,\" Bolkestein said.Since 1990, Bolkestein said the European community has added 900,000 jobsand has seen improved competition and productivity add 1.5 percent to grossdomestic product growth because of measures taken to create a single marketfor financial services.If the European Union is successful at restructuring its financial system by2005, Bolkestein said he sees other benefits to include a lower cost ofcapital for all companies, a deeper and more vibrant venture capital market,lower costs of purchasing financial products, and higher returns on pensionsand investment funds.To realize those benefits, Bolkestein said the European Commission wouldlike to see an integrated securities market in place by 2003, replacing theindividual domestic securities markets of the European Union's 15 memberstates.\"Mergers and alliances between existing exchanges are already breaking downbarriers, pooling liquidity, reducing clearing costs, decreasing volatility,and increasing transparency,\" Bolkestein said.

Fed's Greenspan Comments on `Egregious' Accounting at Enron2002-01-24 12:40 (New York) Washington, Jan. 24 (Bloomberg) -- The following are comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on accounting practices at Enron Corp. Greenspan's remarks came during the question-and-answer part of testimony to the Senate Budget Committee. ``I think that the extraordinary response to Enron is something I think is very helpful and indeed an indication that the people in this society have required that we maintain a very high standard of trustworthiness in our business operations,'' Greenspan said. ``If everybody did what is alleged in the Enron accounting system, our system could not work,'' he said. ``That is, if you have a system, a market system, it works off information. If you don't have a way to evaluate a particular asset you cannot price it and if you cannot price it you cannot get the appropriate allocation of capital in a market society.'' As to Enron's accounting practices, Greenspan said: ``I think that was an egregious act. I tried as hard as I could to find an economic reason why those affiliates were constructed the way they were. The simplest explanation was the obvious explanation: that they did not want to indicate what their true earnings position was.'' Greenspan said he would be concerned about Enron's practices harming the economy ``if there wasn't a reaction to it.'' ``But the reaction, I think, is going to create a really major rethinking by a lot of people about whether there is a spin game going on with respect to the information coming out of business into the investment community,'' he said. While ``there's been an element of that'' in the past, ``I think there's going to be a good deal less of that. The old issue of competing for reputation is going to re-emerge. And I think you're going to find at some point that there are going to be people out there who are going to say `our accounts you can rely on' and that probably will increase their price-earnings ratios.''--Michael McKee in Washington (202) 624-1895 or mmckee@bloomberg.net.

He specifically mentions that the construction of Enron's affiliates was to not indicate what their true earnings position was, which aligns with the use of special purpose entities (SPEs) like Raptor to hide losses through mark-to-market accounting.\n",

Greenspan's remarks came during the question-and-answer part of testimony to the Senate Budget Committee. ``I think that the extraordinary response to Enron is something I think is very helpful and indeed an indication that the people in this society have required that we maintain a very high standard of trustworthiness in our business operations,'' Greenspan said. ``If everybody did what is alleged in the Enron accounting system, our system could not work,'' he said. ``That is, if you have a system, a market system, it works off information. If you don't have a way to evaluate a particular asset you cannot price it and if you cannot price it you cannot get the appropriate allocation of capital in a market society.'' As to Enron's accounting practices, Greenspan said: ``I think that was an egregious act. I tried as hard as I could to find an economic reason why those affiliates were constructed the way they were. The simplest explanation was the obvious explanation: that they did not want to indicate what their true earnings position was.'' Greenspan said he would be concerned about Enron's practices harming the economy ``if there wasn't a reaction to it.'' ``But the reaction, I think, is going to create a really major rethinking by a lot of people about whether there is a spin game going on with respect to the information coming out of business into the investment community,'' he said. While ``there's been an element of that'' in the past, ``I think there's going to be a good deal less of that. The old issue of competing for reputation is going to re-emerge. And I think you're going to find at some point that there are going to be people out there who are going to say `our accounts you can rely on' and that probably will increase their price-earnings ratios.''\",\n",

The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (A=ICPA), the industry's professional association, points out that accountants= examine the books of more than 15,000 public companies every year; they ar=e accused of errors in just 0.1% of those audits. But oh, the price of thos=e few failures. Lynn Turner, former chief accountant of the Securities and =Exchange Commission, estimates that investors have lost more than $100 bill=ion because of financial fraud and the accompanying earnings restatements s=ince 1995.=20Perhaps the most glaring example of self-regulation's deficiency has been a=ccountants' unwillingness to deal with conflicts of interest. Over the year=s, the major auditing firms have transformed themselves into \"professional =services\" companies that derive an increasing portion of revenues and profi=ts from consulting: selling computer systems, advising clients on tax shelt=ers, and evaluating their business strategies. In 1999, according to the SE=C, half of the Big Five's revenues came from consulting fees, vs. 13% in 19=81.=20Auditing, meanwhile, has become a commodity. Firms have even been accused o=f using it as a loss leader, a way of getting in the door at a company to s=ell more-profitable consulting contracts. \"Audit work is a marvelous market=ing tool,\" says Lou Lowenstein, a professor emeritus of finance and law at =Columbia University. \"You are already there doing the audit. You say their =internal controls are no good. Well, who are they going to call to fix it?\"= But this requires a firm to work for the public (auditing) and management =(consulting). \"You cannot serve them both,\" says former SEC commissioner Be=vis Longstreth.=20This conflict may have played a role at Enron. Andersen received $25 millio=n in auditing fees from Enron last year. That's money Andersen was paid bot=h as Enron's outside auditor, certifying its financial statements, and as i=ts internal auditor, making sure Enron had the right systems to keep its bo=oks and working to detect fraud and irregularities. This double duty alone =raised a serious potential for conflict. Besides $25 million in accounting =fees, Andersen was paid $23 million for consulting services. \"If you are au=diting your own creations, it is very difficult to criticize them,\" says Ro=bert Willens, a Lehman Brothers tax expert who disapproves of the accountin=g profession's recent move into selling aggressive tax shelters. Andersen h=as not revealed the details of its work on Enron's highly controversial off=-balance-sheet transactions, but the accounting firms have never believed c=onsulting fees compromise their objectivity. \"They have militantly refused =to ever acknowledge the possibility of a problem,\" Longstreth says.\n",

However, without the content of the actual conversation or meeting, it is not possible to assign a definitive score.

Using mark-to-market methods, a company calculates the fair market value of a commodity position - whether it's a contract, an option, a swap, etc. - at the time, even if the value of the position is realized over a longer period. The problem with this method is the actual cash a company realizes from the position might not be the same value the company calculated in its original assessment. Also, sometimes it isn't easy to calculate the fair value of the commodity position. This is particularly true in instances where the market for the commodity isn't liquid. Over time, companies with the highest level of disclosure regarding their mark-to-market gains will most likely trade at higher multiples to counterparts that provide little or no disclosure, said ABN AMRO Inc. analyst Paul Patterson. Encouragingly, it appears companies may already be responding to the call for added disclosure. According to a survey Patterson conducted, more companies with energy trading units were willing to disclose the details of their mark-to-market accounting practices during third-quarter conference calls compared with those in the second quarter. Patterson said he prefers earnings that are cash-based. \"All things being equal, we believe reported earnings that more closely reflect the timely realization of cash have a higher quality associated with them than earnings that do not,\" he said. He expects investors to become smarter and learn to distinguish between earnings growth through accrual accounting and growth fueled by mark-to-market accounting. At the end of the day, it is not a matter of simply producing profits, but being able to say where those earnings came from, said one investor, who manages a pension fund. Some investors also may be placing a greater emphasis on the cash flow the energy merchants produce. Tim O'Brien, portfolio manager of the Gabelli Utilities Fund, said energy merchants that own the physical power assets to back up their trading positions should trade at a premium to an independent power producers and traditional utility companies. Still, the stocks should be valued at less than the growth rate of the company because of their heavy exposures to commodity prices. Energy merchants include companies such as Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) and Dominion Resources Inc. (D). According to O'Brien, the group never deserved to have the price-to-earnings multiples above 20- to 30-times earnings, which were once paid for the stocks. \"We all got sucked up by the up-leg of the cycle and forgot just how cyclical these companies are,\" O'Brien said, adding that the average multiple should be in the high single-digits to the high-teens.\n",

Theseprofit-and-loss reports were designed toreflect economic reality. Frequently theydid not. Instead of recording the entireprofit for a trade in one column, sometraders reportedly split the profit from atrade into two columns. The first columnreflected the portion of the actual profitsthe trader intended to add to Enron's cur-rentfinancial statements. The second col-umn,ironically labeled the 'prudency'reserve, included the remainder.\"Partnoy told the committee that inhis estimation, \"Enron's 'prudency'reserves did not depict economic reality,nor could they have been intended to doso. Instead, 'prudency' was a slush fundthat could be used to smooth out profitsand losses over time. The portion of prof-itsrecorded as 'prudency' could be usedto offset any future losses,\" he said.He recommended that investigatorsquestion Enron employees who wereinvolved in these transactions \"to get a senseof whether my summaries are complete.\"Alleged Enron abuses of mark-to-market accounting emerge\n",

As soon as it signed a contract, it estimated= what its profits would be over the entire term, based on assumptions about= future energy prices, energy use and even the speed at which different sta=tes would deregulate their electric markets.=20Then Energy Services would immediately pay its sales representatives cash b=onuses on those projections and report the results to investors as profits.= By making its assumptions more optimistic, the division could report highe=r profits.=20As a result, the sales representatives and senior managers pressed the mana=gers who made the central assumptions about deregulation and energy prices,= said Glenn Dickson, a manager at Energy Services who was fired in December=.=20''The whole culture was much more sales driven than anything else,'' Mr. Di=ckson said.

Where there was an active market, as with stocks =or publicly traded bonds, that is relatively easy to do and difficult to ma=nipulate. But where there is no such market, companies were allowed by the =rules to use their own models to estimate fair value, and to treat that as =the market value.=20The mark-to-market technique was used to report profits in some Enron busin=esses. When its energy services unit signed a power-supply contract with a =company, it would structure the deal to bring it under those accounting rul=es. It would then project electricity and natural gas prices for the full t=erm of the deal, which could last as long as 10 years, according to former =Enron officials.=20Many of the contracts covered companies in states that had not yet deregula=ted their power markets. In those cases, Enron forecast when the states wou=ld deregulate those markets and then projected what prices would be under t=he currently nonexistent deregulated market.=20Then, based on its projections, Enron would calculate its total profit over= the life of the contract. After discounting that figure to account for the= risk its customer would default and the fact that it would not receive mos=t payments for years, Enron would book the profit immediately.=20Mr. Lucas said it had not occurred to him that anyone would use models to t=ry to forecast energy prices for 10 years, and then use those models to rep=ort profits, but that the rule had not placed a limit on such trades. He no=ted that any trade that required assumptions for such a long time would app=ear to be very risky.=20A former Enron official has told associates that Arthur Andersen, Enron's a=uditor, took a number of issues related to Enron's accounting to the task f=orce. That official said Andersen accountants viewed the company's structur=ing of financial instruments to be on the cutting edge.=20Andersen has a seat on the task force, as do each of the four other large a=ccounting firms. The other members among the 13 on the task force are 4 rep=resentatives of smaller accounting firms and 4 executives from large compan=ies. One industry seat is now vacant, after an executive from General Elect=ric left. The others are held by officials of J. P. Morgan, Exxon Mobil and= Dow Chemical.=20The task force does not disclose who suggests topics, so it is not possible= to be certain which Enron issues were considered.

      "The collapse of Enron in 2001 stands as one of the most infamous corporate scandals in history. Central to this downfall were the company's use of Special Purpose Entities (SPEs) and mark-to-market accounting practices, which allowed for significant financial manipulation. This analysis will explore three specific examples that highlight how these methods contributed to Enron's eventual bankruptcy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example 1: The Use of SPEs in Hiding Debt**\n",
      "\n",
      "One prominent example is the creation and use of LJM2S, an SPE designed by Jeffrey Skilling, Enron's former CEO. This entity was used to hide over $1 billion in debt from Enron’s balance sheet. By transferring assets into this off-balance-sheet vehicle, Enron could inflate its financial health and mislead investors about the company's true leverage status.\n",

      "\n",
      "**Example 2: Mark-to-Market Accounting to Overstate Revenue**\n",
      "\n",
      "Enron's mark-to-market accounting allowed it to record potential future profits as actual revenue immediately upon signing contracts, regardless of whether those revenues were actually realized. For instance, the company entered into long-term energy contracts with various entities and reported these agreements as immediate income, significantly boosting its financial statements in the short term.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example 3: The Role of Auditors in Enron's Scandal**\n",
      "\n",
      "The auditing firm Arthur Andersen played a critical role by failing to challenge Enron’s aggressive accounting tactics. They did not adequately scrutinize the complex financial structures and transactions that were designed to obfuscate the company's true financial condition, thereby contributing indirectly to the misleading presentation of Enron's financial health.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion**\n",
      "\n",
      "The use of SPEs and mark-to-market accounting at Enron was a deliberate strategy to present an illusionary image of profitability and stability. These practices not only distorted the company’s true financial state but also eroded investor trust when they were uncovered. The examples provided illustrate how these methods, coupled with inadequacies in oversight by auditors, led to one of the most significant corporate collapses in history.\n",

      "4327 2783 \"There could be a quality-of-earnings issue,\" says Tom Linsmeier, an associate professor of accounting at Michigan State University, who co-authored the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's rules on market-risk disclosures for financial instruments. \"There certainly might be great volatility that could cause what now looks like a winning, locked-in gain to not arise sometime in the future.\" The companies reject any suggestion that there may be quality problems with their earnings. But at the heart of the situation is an accounting technique that allows companies to include as current earnings those profits they expect to realize from energy-related contracts and other derivative instruments in future periods, sometimes stretching over more than 20 years. So-called mark-to-market accounting is mandated by accounting-rule makers when companies have outstanding energy-related contracts on their books at the end of a quarter, such as agreements to sell electricity or buy natural gas over a period of time at certain prices. Under those rules, companies estimate the fair market values of those contracts on their balance sheets each quarter as assets or liabilities. Changes in the value of a contract from quarter to quarter then are either added to or subtracted from net earnings. If, for instance, the market price for natural gas rises above the price specified in a company's contract to buy gas, generally the company will record an unrealized gain. That gain is recognized as income and recorded as an asset on the company's balance sheet. At the end of each quarter, the contract is revalued. The value of the previously recorded asset is increased, and any increase in unrealized gain is recorded as additional income. Conversely, if the market value for gas falls, and the value of the contract has declined, any change in the contract's value is recorded on the company's balance sheet, and a loss is recorded on its income statement. e Yet in their financial reports, the companies only vaguely describe the methods they use to come up with fair-value estimates on the contracts. Increasingly, quoted market prices offering independent guidance are becoming readily available for several years into the future. However, with some long-term derivative instruments, particularly electricity contracts, future market prices don't extend far enough to cover the full life of those contracts. And in those cases, companies are allowed to base valuations on their own undisclosed estimates, assumptions and pricing models. \"Ultimately they're telling you what they think the answer is, but they're not telling you how they got to that answer,\" says Stephen Campbell, an analyst at Business Valuation Services in Dallas. \"That is essentially saying `trust me.'\"\n",

DF---------------------- Forwarded by Drew Fossum/ET&S/Enron on 09/25/2000 ET & S Business Intelligence DepartmentSubject: The Press Behind the Stock Dip?TEXAS JOURNALEnergy Traders Cite Gains, But Some Math Is MissingBy Jonathan WeilStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal09/20/2000The Wall Street JournalTexas JournalT1(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)Volatile prices for natural gas and electricity are creating high-voltage earnings growth at some companies with large energy-trading units. But investors counting on these gains could be in for a jolt down the road. Shares of these companies have been on a tear lately. And some of the biggest players are in Houston, the center of the energy-trading industry. Dynegy Inc.'s stock is up more than fourfold so far this year at $53.438, and now trades for 41 times what analysts project the company's 2000 earnings will be, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. Shares of Enron Corp., the largest trader of gas and electricity in North America, have nearly doubled this year to $84.875, or 60 times earnings. Meanwhile, El Paso Energy Corp.'s stock has jumped 61% this year to $62.375, or 24 times earnings.Traders at these and other companies are capitalizing on the wild price swings and supply fluctuations that have accompanied deregulation in some regional markets. Natural-gas prices have more than doubled in the past year, while supplies have tightened. And the rapid price fluctuations for electricity have prompted many large businesses to seek price protection through hedging or fixed-price contracts, generating large premiums for traders. But what many investors may not realize is that much of these companies' recent profits constitute unrealized, noncash gains. Frequently, these profits depend on assumptions and estimates about future market factors, the details of which the companies do not provide, and which time may prove wrong. And because of minimal disclosure standards in these kinds of cases, it's difficult for investors to assess whose assumptions might be too aggressive, or what market changes might invalidate the assumptions -- and force earnings revisions.\n",

Otherspeakers included Mark Price and Steve Rosenthal of KPMG, and Chuck Wheelerof Alston & Bird.Price said Financial Accounting Standard No. 133, adopted in 1998 by theFinancial Accounting Standards Board and amended in June (118 DTR G-7,6/19/00), requires separate accounting for derivatives, using amark-to-market approach like that used under Internal Revenue Code Section475. The new rule requires that any change in the value of the derivative be\"booked\"--included as a gain or loss in determining the company's income forfinancial accounting purposes--even if the company has not disposed of thederivative.The result, Price said, is to create increased volatility in the company'sdetermination of income and loss for accounting purposes. Wheeler said thatcompanies do not want this increased volatility to apply to theirdeterminations of income for tax purposes.Price said the accounting profession adopted new standards for derivativesbecause of numerous problems, including:* incomplete reporting, in that some companies reported no informationor reported information only in a footnote;* inconsistent reporting, in that companies used different rules fordetermining cost and value;* difficulty in applying the accounting rules; and* lack of transparency, in that companies took different approaches intheir treatment of derivatives,meaning income was not determined under the same rules andinformation on financial statements could not be compared with reliability.Issues for Congress to StudyBuckley said the mark-to-market approach is slowly beingadopted in the tax system. He said it was not something he favored acrossthe board but in his view it made sense for the tax system to apply themark-to-market approach to derivatives. He said the problems identified byPrice in accounting for derivatives also applied to the tax system--there isuncertainty and inconsistency.Buckley also said it would simplify recordkeeping to conformthe tax system to the accounting approach, and he favored Congress lookingat this question. He said that Congress's adoption of the mark-to-marketapproach for securities in the early 1990s was the right approach, and hethought that the Financial Accounting Standards Board had taken an\"interesting and important step\" in adopting FAS 133.Buckley said he sees the problem of defining a derivative asa major issue for the tax law, and questioned whether the accountingdefinition was \"workable.\" Other panelists said it is, but Price noted thatthe definition is very fact-specific, and Wheeler said the rules are so newit is too early to tell whether companies will attempt to structuretransactions to use the accounting definition.\n",

The planshave been drawn up by the Joint Working Group, a body made up mainly ofaccounting standard-setters from the world's biggest economies. Bankers saythe results would lead to dramatic swings in the value of balance sheetassets that would often be meaningless and potentially damaging.It is certainly the case that the existing accounting rules often fail toreflect the impact of changes in interest rates or credit risks on bankearnings. Fair value accounting would force banks to adjust their accountsin the light of rises and falls in the values of all financial instruments.The result would be greater volatility in profits but proponents of thechange say it would give investors a truer picture of corporate health.Not so, say the banks. While fair value accounting is appropriate fortrading activities, it would not reflect the real business of makinglong-term loans to customers, which are largely held to maturity andtherefore rarely traded. Banks manage loan portfolios to make a stableinterest margin over the terms of the loans - not on the profits determinedeach year in relation to the interest rate at the time.\n",

      "4229 2685 \"It is basic accounting that you don't record equity until you get cash, and a note doesn't count as cash,\" says Lynn Turner, a former chief accountant for the SEC. \"The question that raises is: How did both partners and the manager on this audit miss this simple Accounting 101 rule?\" Adds Douglas Carmichael, an accounting professor at Baruch College in New York: \"Anyone that's an accountant looking at the entry should have known\" it violated GAAP. An Enron spokesman, Vance Meyer, says, \"The accounting error was just that -- an error,\" explaining that, \"We believed it was not material. However, it was, of course, corrected . . . And we did make the correction with Andersen's concurrence.\" He says Andersen \"performed limited quarterly reviews\" of the company's unaudited financial statements and reviewed the entries that resulted in the shareholder-equity overstatements \"to the extent they deemed necessary.\" To some who follow the accounting world closely, this has a familiar ring to it. During the past few years, every Big Five auditor has been hit by multiple accounting debacles at high-profile clients. For Andersen, Enron joins a list including Waste Management Inc. and Sunbeam Corp. While the names of the clients may change, the issues remain largely the same. For instance, Enron had reported net income of $105 million for 1997, a figure that Enron last week said will be reduced to $9 million in its upcoming restatement for that year. Enron said the reduction is mostly because of $51 million in various unexplained \"audit adjustments and reclassifications\" that its auditors had proposed in 1997 but at the time had determined to be \"immaterial.\" Cumulatively, those immaterial adjustments added up to nearly half of Enron's net income for 1997 and now will be included in the company's restatements. That looks a lot like what happened at Sunbeam. According to the SEC's May settlement order with Sunbeam, Andersen auditors had routinely dismissed so many violations of GAAP as immaterial that they eventually piled up to produce significant distortions in Sunbeam's financial statements, making the barely solvent consumer-products maker look handsomely profitable. Sunbeam filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court protection this past February. In May, the SEC filed a civil lawsuit against five former Sunbeam executives and the Andersen partner in charge of the company's audit, accusing them of engaging in a massive financial fraud; all six defendants have denied the SEC's allegations. Andersen itself wasn't named as a defendant and has said it believes the lawsuit against its partner was an unjustified action over questions of professional judgment.\n",

That is, each week when we release a new expected value of the gross box office receipt, we balance all the opening positions the same way as in a regular future market. This way, we can give margin calls to the couterparties who are expected to owe us a lots of money.In the last paragraph, I think the gross box office can also be determined from the market itself (i.e., if there are lots of buyers, our offer price should go up.)We can offer other derivative products such as options as well.-Chonawee\n",

Often, these profits depend on assumptions and estimates ab=out future market factors, details of which the companies don't provide.

      "4080 2536 Bad trading. Enron's main technique to pump up earnings probably revolvedaround a loose-as-a-goose process for the accounting of energy derivatives.Called mark-to-market, the technique involves evaluating contracts at \"fairvalue\" prices. Since some of these contracts stretched out for 20 years, thefutures market provides no firm prices. And, absent a liquid market withclear prices, \"fair value\" becomes a mug's game in which companies canvastly inflate value. These overstated gains, of course, were also unrealized, noncash gains. InSeptember 2000, Jonathan Weil, a reporter for the Journal, took a look atEnron's second quarter and found that absent noncash earnings, Enron wouldhave had a loss. Mr. Weil later found that for the year as a whole,unrealized trading gains accounted for more than half of the company'soriginally reported pretax profits. Hardly a confidence-builder in thequality of Enron's earnings.When their derivative strategies started to go sour, this theory runs, Enronremoved the contracts from its financial statements and hid them in specialentities created for just that purpose.Bad Assets. Another theory locates Enron's earning problems in their hardassets. Enron had a bunch of huge and underperforming assets, like itsbroadband company, water company and power plants in India and Brazil. Inorder to hustle those assets and associated debts off its financial reports,the company created some limited partnerships to buy these dogs -- eitherwith bank loans or money provided by Enron itself. These partnerships(allegedly) transferred enough control to third parties to get them offEnron's balance sheet. Enron guaranteed these deals with \"make good\" provisions backed by Enronstock -- a promise that Enron would make good any losses in the value of thepartnerships.

Much more work is neededbefore fair value accounting can be proclaimed as the right answer forbanks.IASB Taking Tentative Steps on Agenda With Help From National RulemakingGroupsBNA - May 29, 2001By Steve BurkholderLONDON--The International Accounting Standards Board took more steps May 25to set its rulemaking agenda, placing fast-track efforts to improve existingstandards and to ease companies' switching to international rules at thefront of a long docket.The steps are tentative, however. Under its constitution, IASB must consultwith its advisory council--which is yet to be named--before it can formallyfix an agenda. A meeting with the advisory panel is expected to take placein July. The improvements project is an omnibus effort intended to mend avariety of rules IASB inherited from its predecessor board, theInternational Accounting Standards Committee, and to rid those standards ofinconsistencies and inappropriate choices in accounting methods.The transition, or first-time application, project is being watched closelyby the Big 5 accounting firms and their European client-companies. Thataudience is mindful of the planned European Union directive that wouldrequire some 7,000 companies in the region to carry out their financialreporting using international standards by 2005.\n",

      "4377 2833 The significance of special charges -- whether they represent old baggage from the past or illuminate the future -- is at the center of a lively debate under way in the accounting world. One side holds that generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, provide the best available snapshot of a company's financial position. GAAP, which companies must use in their official financial statements, requires that nearly all charges be treated as ordinary expenses. Others, including many stock analysts, contend the best view comes from \"pro forma\" financial results -- calculated \"as if\" many expenses didn't really exist. The idea is that these expenses aren't relevant to future performance. Companies increasingly highlight the pro forma view in news releases they generally put out before their official filings with regulators. But pro forma calculations adhere to no particular standard. Companies essentially do what they want. Now, accountants and economists say the practice of excluding blemishes is so widespread that companies and analysts often guide investors to dismiss charges that contain prescient warnings -- like the one at Bethlehem Steel. Ms. Applebaum, the Salomon Smith Barney analyst who played down Bethlehem's big write-off, explains that she has covered other steel companies that returned to profitability shortly after writing off deferred tax assets. She thought Bethlehem would do the same. She notes that GAAP rules on such assets obliged Bethlehem to follow strict criteria in assessing its chances of future profitability -- stricter criteria than stock analysts typically use. As for Bethlehem, Chief Financial Officer Leonard M. Anthony says the charge the company took was to some extent \"predictive of the future.\" GAAP also has well-established standards for writing down other kinds of assets. Companies must reduce the value on their books of anything from a customer loan to a manufacturing plant when its worth has diminished. Again, Wall Street stock analysts tend to dismiss the resulting charges as one-time events. Sometimes that makes sense. During the 1981-82 recession, restructuring was a part of many corporations' strategies. They took charges for streamlining, outsourcing and otherwise shedding costs to position themselves for recovery. Because the resulting earnings volatility made it hard to compare companies' growth rates or price-earnings ratios, and because the charges weren't expected to recur, there was logic to excluding them to come up with \"smoothed\" earnings trends. \"Investors came to look upon the charges, correctly in many cases, as evidence that those firms had recognized past mistakes and had made tough decisions to become more efficient,\" said a September 2001 study by the Jerome Levy Economics Institute at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y.\n",

      "4360 2816 According to the AASB's chairman, Mr Keith Alfredson, the document on whichcomments will be invited is likely to ``blow the minds'' of many in thefinancial markets, major corporates and the accounting profession, judgingby the criticisms it has attracted even before its publication.But he said time for argument was fast running out. Whatever happened afterthe draft and invitation to comment were issued in the run-up to Christmas,``Australia will have to make a choice.''Accounting bodies worldwide have been working on standards for financialinstruments to prevent the derivatives -related disasters that rocked manycompanies during the late 1980s and early 1990s, including US companyProcter & Gamble, which lost $US157 million on interest-rate derivatives in1994.The matter has become urgent in Australia partly because the United Stateshas introduced its own standard Financial Accounting Standard Boardstatement No133 which became effective for some companies on July 1, andwhich will operate from January 1 for those whose financial years coincidewith the calendar.FAS 133 is regarded as a nightmare by corporate treasurers in the US andhere, because it requires derivatives and other financial instruments to be``marked to market'' every quarter, rather than accounted for on afair-value basis.Its critics claim it will lead to volatility and confusion in companyfinancial statements.Mr Alfredson said that in the US, ``there is now a special interpretationgroup like the Urgent Issues Group here interpreting 133.

IASC has incorporated elementsof FAS 133 into its own much-criticised financial instruments standard, IAS39.It remains to be seen how much simpler the fair-value approach will be.``In fair-value accounting, you get the market value for the instruments atthe time and fair value them. It sounds easy in principle, but it is muchmore complicated in practice,'' Mr Alfredson said.Developing the appropriate standard is only half the battle, however; thetrick is to gain widespread acceptance for it.

      "3899 2355 CHICAGO, Jan. 2 /PRNewswire/ -- Andersen today announced that its system of accounting and auditing quality has been deemed to provide reasonable assurance of compliance with professional standards, following the most extensive peer review in the firm's history. Deloitte & Touche's report, which includes an unmodified opinion for the review year ended August 31, 2001, has been accepted by the Peer Review Committee of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' (AICPA) SEC Practice and is available at the AICPA, http://www.aicpa.org/members/div/secps/index.htm . Every three years since 1978, major accounting firms, under the oversight of the Public Oversight Board (POB), have been engaged to conduct reviews of the accounting and auditing practices of member firms in the AICPA SEC Practice Section (SECPS). The scope of this year's peer review of Andersen was expanded after financial reporting issues emerged at Enron Corp. Andersen requested, and Deloitte & Touche had separately concluded, that expanded procedures were appropriate. Deloitte & Touche independently determined the scope of the expanded peer review procedures.In total, the peer and Andersen's internal practice review covered 240 Andersen audit engagements in over 30 Andersen offices and the Andersen national office. The engagements reviewed by Deloitte & Touche reviewers and Andersen practice review teams involved some 45 percent of Andersen's U.S. audit partners. The engagements selected for review represented a cross-section of Andersen's accounting and auditing practice with emphasis on higher-risk engagements. It included examining working paper files and reports and interviewing engagement personnel. Deloitte & Touche's opinion was \"unmodified,\" without qualification. However, three issues not deemed significant enough to affect the opinion were raised in an attached comment letter. Such comments are not unusual in peer review reports. The comments related to: documentation of certain auditing procedures on some engagements; communications with audit committees in some instances; and management representation letters that needed more tailoring in some instances. In its response to Deloitte & Touche's comments, Andersen said it had taken, or would take, the steps recommended to improve its accounting and auditing practices. About Andersen\n",

My impression is that it is the obligation of the product development people to make sure that the products that they are selling are billable and i will help them identify where the prices are coming from.. how they do it is something that is beyond all the mess that i am willing to tackle at this time. If they are wanting a signoff from us on the product that is launched then they better show us that they have viable billing capabilities.hope this helps.-narsimha -----Original Message-----Subject:FW: Maryland Index Product - UpdateNarsimha,What was the \"game plan\" for accurately passing through (i) ancillaries (ii) losses and (iii) other uplifts, without opening up our books to audit by customer(s) to verify accurate passthru of costs, other than energy costs? -----Original Message-----Subject:Maryland Index Product - UpdateToday, Gillian and I met with Murray O'Neil, Victor Gonzalez, Tom Blanks, Jason Woodward and Erin Stus about billing/systems issues with the MD Index product. They are willing to support the MD index product in its current hourly-pricing design. So, we can continue to assume a pass-through of hourly PJM BGE prices and all associated ancillaries, losses, and other uplifts (with physical delivery 7/1/02), with the only fixed component being deal costs (including a scheduling fee) and margin.One issue that came up is how much of the hourly PJM data is already being tracked...so duplication of systems can be prevented. Do you know of any particular PJM databases that already exist, that would be used to develop the PJM BGE index?The draft Product Approval Template (copy attached) is still on target, so please let me know if you have any changes. If not, we will soon broaden the reviewers and see if we can get approval signatures. Thanks!Bob\n",

      "Introduction:\n",
      "Climate change is one of the most pressing issues facing our planet today. It has far-reaching impacts on ecosystems, economies, and societies worldwide. In this paper, we will explore various aspects of climate change, including its causes, effects, and potential solutions. We aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of this complex issue for high school students who are interested in environmental science.\n",
      "\n",
      "Section 1: Causes of Climate Change\n",
      "Climate change is primarily caused by the increase in greenhouse gases (GHGs) in Earth's atmosphere, which trap heat and lead to global warming. The main sources of GHG emissions include burning fossil fuels for energy production, deforestation, industrial processes, and agricultural activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.1 Fossil Fuels: Burning coal, oil, and natural gas releases carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere. CO2 is responsible for approximately 75% of human-induced GHG emissions. The use of fossil fuels has increased dramatically since the Industrial Revolution due to their affordability and high energy content.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.2 Deforestation: Trees absorb carbon dioxide during photosynthesis, but when forests are cleared or burned, this stored carbon is released back into the atmosphere as CO2. Additionally, deforestation reduces Earth's capacity to remove GHGs from the air through natural processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.3 Industrial Processes: Manufacturing and construction activities release various greenhouse gases such as methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and fluorinated gases, which have a higher global warming potential than CO2. These emissions result from chemical reactions during production processes or the use of certain materials like cement and steel.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.4 Agriculture: Livestock farming produces methane through enteric fermentation (digestion) in ruminant animals, while rice cultivation releases methane due to anaerobic decomposition of organic matter in flooded fields. Nitrous oxide emissions result from the use of synthetic fertilizers and manure management practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Section 2: Effects of Climate Change\n",
      "Climate change has numerous consequences for ecosystems, human health, economies, and societies worldwide. Some key impacts include:\n",
      "\n",
      "2.1 Rising Temperatures: Global temperatures have increased by approximately 1°C since the pre-industrial era, with projections indicating a further rise of up to 4°C by the end of this century if current trends continue. This warming has led to more frequent and intense heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, and melting glaciers.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.2 Sea Level Rise: As global temperatures increase, ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica melt, causing sea levels to rise. Additionally, thermal expansion of seawater contributes to this phenomenon. The consequences include coastal flooding, erosion, saltwater intrusion into freshwater sources, and displacement of populations living near the coasts.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.3 Changes in Precipitation Patterns: Climate change has altered precipitation patterns worldwide, leading to more intense rainfall events (floods) as well as prolonged drought periods. These changes can negatively impact agriculture and water resources, affecting food security and human health.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.4 Ocean Acidification: Increased CO2 emissions have led to higher concentrations of carbon dioxinas the atmosphere, which dissolves in seawater and forms carbonic acid. This process lowers ocean pH levels (acidity), affecting marine life such as coral reefs, shellfish, and plankton populations that form the base of many food chains.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.5 Biodiversity Loss: Climate change has disrupted ecosystems by altering habitats, migration patterns, and species interactions. This can lead to a decline in biodiversity as some species struggle to adapt or migrate to more suitable environments. The loss of biodiversity threatens the stability of ecosystems and their ability to provide essential services such as pollination, water purification, and carbon sequestration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Section 3: Potential Solutions for Climate Change Mitigation\n",
      "Addressing climate change requires a combination of mitigation (reducing GHG emissions) and adaptation strategies. Some potential solutions include:\n",
      "\n",
      "3.1 Renewable Energy Sources: Transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, hydroelectric, and geothermal power can significantly reduce CO2 emissions. Investments in research and development of new technologies will help improve the efficiency and affordability of these alternatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.2 Energy Efficiency: Improving energy efficiency across various sectors (residential, commercial, industrial) through better insulation, efficient appliances, and smart grid systems can reduce overall GHG emissions while maintaining economic growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.3 Reforestation and Afforestation: Planting trees on deforested lands or creating new forests (afforestation) helps sequester carbon dioxinas the atmosphere, mitigating climate change effects. Additionally, preserving existing forests is crucial to maintain their role as carbon sinks.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.4 Carbon Capture and Storage: Developing technologies that capture CO2 emissions from power plants or industrial processes and store them underground can help reduce atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. However, this approach should not be seen as a substitute for reducing GHG emissions at their source.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.5 Sustainable Agriculture: Implementing sustainable agricultural practices such as crop rotation, agroforestry, and organic farming can reduce methane and nitrous oxide emissions while maintaining food production levels. Additionally, reducing meat consumption and promoting plant-based diets may help lower the overall carbon footprint of human activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.6 International Cooperation: Climate change is a global issue that requires collective action from all nations. The Paris Agreement, signed by 197 countries in 2015, sets out ambitious targets for reducing GHG emissions and adapting to climate impacts while providing financial support to developing countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, addressing the challenges posed by climate change requires a multifaceted approach that combines mitigation strategies with adaptation measures. By working together on an international scale, we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and build resilience in our societies, ecosystems, and economies to better cope with the impacts of climate change.\n",

      "4415 2871 If there is any part of this story that demands an investigation - by Congress, by Justice, by the accounting industry itself - it is the moral failure of a leading firm in the profession to fulfill its moral duty to unflinchingly, and without bias, uncover the truth and present to the weak, the vulnerable and those without influence or voice. But we can't stop at Arthur Andersen. The real \"values\" crisis represented by the Enron mess is far deeper, and stretches across our economy. We are all being victimized by it, and the situation is growing ever worse. It is the great unreported business story of our time: the growing failure of the accounting system to accurately capture what is going in the new hyperspeed economy. Simply put, we have no idea what any company is worth today. The accounting industry is mired in a system that was devised 600 years ago and has only been fine-tuned ever since. It doesn't work any more. Accountants know it, corporate executives know it, and the stock market knows it. The general recognition of this fact has led to a widespread ethical sloppiness made manifest in such things as Arthur Andersen's apparent conflict. The reality is that the only time anybody really checks an audit anymore is after a financial disaster like Enron, when scapegoats must be found. Rear-View Mirror Accounting I once likened traditional accounting to driving a car by only looking in the rear view mirror. It can tell you where a company has recently been, but it is unable to tell you where that company is now. And in a world in which change occurs in nanoseconds, such obsolete data is worthless. Today, events arrive so swiftly, and change so constant, that it is no longer even enough to operate in the present. Modern business now runs in the future. The result is a growing gap between traditional \"book\" value and actual market value - and through that gap drives not only companies like Enron, but truly valuable firms like General Electric and Intel. Traditional accounting has long dealt with that gap through a line entry entitled \"goodwill.\" But it was typically only added when a company sold for more than the total value of its inventory, buildings, etc. At most, this goodwill only represented a few percent of the total value. That was then. In the modern economy, for great, fast moving, innovative young companies this so-called \"goodwill\" can represent 90 percent of their value. When a corporate audit can only tell us about ten percent of a company, what the hell is the point? There have been a number of efforts in recent years to come up with innovative new ways to determine corporate value, many of them under the all-encompassing terms \"intellectual capital\" or \"intangible assets\". But they are still in their earliest stages, and most slam up against the formidable wall of the traditional accounting industry.\n",

IASB has formal\"liaison\" relationships with those boards.A sharing of human resources by the sparely staffed IASB and groups such asthe U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board would be complemented by atrading of knowledge, the rulemakers suggested. \"I expect that the FASBwill gain as much as it gets out of the work of IASB,\" FASB Chairman EdmundJenkins told the international board and his counterparts from around theworld.IASB 'Not a Dictator'At the May 24 meeting, IASB Chairman David Tweedie and his colleagues soughtto provide assurances that the newly restructured international panel willnot usurp the authority of the national standard-setters.

The goal: a system to providereal-time flow of short-term prices and a way to track investors andcompeting issuers. At the time, the global automaker and long-time directCP issuer saw the possibilities as interesting, but not necessarily apriority.All that changed two months later, when DaimlerChrysler's CP was downgradedto A2/P2. Suddenly, big money-market funds, which once constituted 85% ofDaimlerChrysler's market, were no longer buyers. Nickoley had an immediateneed to figure out what other buyers existed out in the market to taketheir place, but it took her a day or two to get investor information outof the mainframe-based system she used to manage CP issuance.In October, the kind of capability Nickoley sought finally became availablewith the introduction of Prescient Funding Desk. Now we know for allcustomers what time of day they trade, what size of trade they normally do,if they come in through cpmarket or on the phone, says Nickoley. Thecustomer analytics was the key.With the development of Funding Desk, companies can get information onprices, including fluctuations in competitors?

The equity culture that has generated so much growth over the year=s depends on a clear answer, but getting one has become impossible. Enron C=orp. just announced that its earnings for the past three years were oversta=ted by half a billion dollars. How did one of the biggest companies on the =New York Stock Exchange manage to inflate its earnings by 20% without audit=ors, analysts, ratings agencies, and the business press (BusinessWeek inclu=ded) discovering it? In part, blame the breakdown of standardized accountin=g rules and the anarchy that runs rampant in the financial statements of Co=rporate America. The U.S. needs a new set of accounting rules that gives a =clear picture of financial performance. Without integrity in financial repo=rting, the U.S. cannot hope to remain the preeminent place to invest in the= global marketplace (page 76).=20The dot-com bubble was the first indication that there was something seriou=sly wrong with accounting standards. Companies without much of a business m=odel customized their quarterly statements to exclude a grab bag of expense=s in order to put a positive financial spin on their operations. Wall Stree=t conspired in this and encouraged big companies to join in. Soon, the meth=od of calculating earnings began to vary from company to company and even f=rom quarter to quarter within a company. It is now chaos.A stricter adherence to accounting rules won't solve the entire problem. GA=AP, the generally accepted accounting principles, allow all kinds of one-ti=me expenses and noncash charges. This obscures the performance of ongoing o=perations. No one can fathom what are true operating earnings because there= are no guidelines as to what constitutes an extraordinary expense. The res=ult is total confusion. Take earnings per share for the Standard & Poor's 5=00-stock index for the second quarter. Under Thomson Financial/First Call s=tandards, it is $11.82. But it's $9.02 according to S&P and $4.83 under GAA=P. How can investors make intelligent decisions?=20The Financial Accounting Standards Board clearly is failing to do its job. =It has promised to write a set of rules that calculates operating earnings =and relates them to net earnings, but it hasn't delivered. The rating agenc=y Standard & Poor's (owned by The McGraw-Hill Companies, as is BusinessWeek=) is doing a better job. It recently drew up a definition of ``operating ea=rnings'' that includes restructuring costs (including severance), writedown=s from ongoing operations, and the cost of stock options. It excludes merge=r and acquisition expenses, litigation settlements, impairment of goodwill,= and gains or losses on asset sales. This is a beginning that FASB should b=uild on. The accounting anarchy has to end.\n",

That's the most basic question an investor can ever ask. The equity culture that has generated so much growth over the years depends on a clear answer, but getting one has become impossible. Enron Corp. just announced that its earnings for the past three years were overstated by half a billion dollars. How did one of the biggest companies on the New York Stock Exchange manage to inflate its earnings by 20% without auditors, analysts, ratings agencies, and the business press (BusinessWeek included) discovering it? In part, blame the breakdown of standardized accounting rules and the anarchy that runs rampant in the financial statements of Corporate America. The U.S. needs a new set of accounting rules that gives a clear picture of financial performance. Without integrity in financial reporting, the U.S. cannot hope to remain the preeminent place to invest in the global marketplace (page 76).\",\n",

      "4303 2759 LONDON -(Dow Jones)- Issues bedeviling the accounting profession for years have finally flashed into the headlines, thanks to Enron and the bursting of the Internet bubble.Unhappily, most are unlikely to be solved anytime soon. Questions of auditor independence and the use of pro forma statements are at the fore. Not far behind are ones on accounting for options and goodwill. And then there's the issue of which standards to use. Right now, \"who guards the guardians\" has leapfrogged to the top of the agenda. The Enron collapse shows that auditors need to be more independent. It's a thinly-disguised fiction that auditors are paid by and act on behalf of shareholders. Clearly, it's corporate management doing the hiring and firing of auditors. And audit itself makes little profit. Instead, accountants rely on consulting and more technical or specialized practices, like M&A, to generate fees. An accountant refusing to pass a company's results runs the risk of losing a big part of his own business. Even the risk of litigation isn't - or at least hasn't been pre-Enron - enough of a deterrent. What's the solution? Make sure companies that audit aren't swayed by conflicts of interest. Regulators should either encourage stand-alone audit firms or prohibit auditors from any other involvement with the companies they scrutinize - even if that's tricky for big international corporations, which can use all of the \"big five\" accounting firms in the course of a year's global dealings. Another dilemma is the issue of pro formas. There's a mounting consensus that pro forma statements are suspect. According to some estimates, pro forma results for S&P 500 companies during the third quarter overstated audited profits by 70%. Why should companies push their pro formas when, after all, there's a perfectly good U.S. audited accounting standard: the U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)? Enron notwithstanding, surveys show investors are more confident with U.S. corporate results than those from Europe or Japan. And yet, U.S. GAAP has its own problems. U.S. accounting is rigidly based on rules, unlike elsewhere, where it's more a case of applying broad principles. Though these rules are designed to ensure standards, they're often subverted by loopholes. U.S. companies can comply with the letter of the law but still offer a distorted picture of fundamentals. The result is that while investors are flooded with information, it's not always helpful in determining a company's value. Enron highlighted one such loophole. The company went under in large part because it was taking on huge, unseen liabilities. These liabilities weren't on the balance sheet, having been planted on special vehicles nominally independent of the firm.\n",

Such disclosures may be outdated anyway by the time they could be included in public financial filings, says Michael Mott, a Dynegy vice president. Mr. Mott further explains that Dynegy could be realizing more cash earnings now if it wanted to. But \"we don't see that would be in the best interests of shareholders,\" Mr. Mott says, because the company figures it can earn more later by leaving much of its gains unrealized for now.   Mr. Linsmeier of Michigan State compares the current situation for energy traders with the accounting controversies that engulfed subprime automobile and residential lenders during the late 1990s, though he emphasizes it's too far early to tell whether the consequences will be similar. Using so-called gain-on-sale accounting (a form of mark-to-market accounting), those lenders booked earnings from loans as soon as they were made, rather than having to wait for them to be paid off, as banks typically do.   But as interest rates fell in 1998, many customers paid off their loans earlier than expected, slashing lenders' profit margins. Compounding matters, the market for mortgage-backed securities dried up in the wake of financial chaos in Russia and other foreign markets, leaving lenders to bear the higher risks of many new loans.   Many investors complained they were blindsided, in part because these lenders generally hadn't disclosed their assumptions about prepayment rates and other variables. After the crash, subprime lenders routinely began disclosing the key assumptions used to value their mortgage portfolios.   At New York University, accounting professor Baruch Lev says investors would be better served if energy traders' financial filings explained the effects of hypothetical commodity-price movements on the values of their risk-management assets, and disclosed the basic assumptions about future commodity-price movements ingrained in their mathematical models. Says Mr. Lev, \"I would like to see much more disclosure, particularly given that this is now becoming a significant component of their earnings.\"\n",

The SEC is examining whether new rules are needed to clarify financial reports and perhaps restrict use of pro forma statements. What's badly needed is a set of rules for calculating operating earnings and a requirement to make clear how they relate to net income. In the end, investors need two numbers--a standardized operating number and an audited net-income number--and a clear explanation of how to get from one to the other.' OUT OF HAND. A widespread consensus is building to do just that. In early November, S&P proposed a set of rules for companies to follow when telling operating earnings. Only the week before, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the rulemakers for GAAP, had announced that they too would be taking up this issue. Volcker says the International Accounting Standards Board is also seeking a uniform definition of operating earnings.\",\n",

      "4338 2794 In Connecticut, FASB has completed work on a set of rules for businesscombinations accounting built on required use of the purchase method (100DTR G-6, 5/23/01). Poolings--prominent accounting practice in the UnitedStates--would be banned after June 30, according to FASB's latest set ofdecisions in the key rulemaking effort.However, FASB would not allow goodwill amortization under its proposedstandard, which is expected to be issued in mid-July. Instead, the U.S.board plans to call for accounting that hinges on tests to gauge whethergoodwill has been impaired--meaning its fair value dips below its bookvalue, leading to a writedown of the intangible asset only when that occurs.Impairment Also Eyed by IASBIASB signaled that goodwill impairment \"might be the way to go,\" as Tweediestated in providing a summary of preliminary board opinions expressed on thesecond day of its four-day meeting in London.However, a number of board members are not ready to rule out goodwillamortization, as shown by comments that were noted by their chairman.Accounting standards on combinations could be better aligned around theworld, but that does not mean IASB would achieve such convergence by \"justslavishly following world opinion,\" Tweedie said.The international board plans to study the issue and accounting optionsthoroughly before it settles on a proposed route for merger and acquisitionaccounting. The research is expected to include a close reading of FASBdocuments chronicling that board's odyssey toward what it calls the\"impairment-only approach\" for goodwill.As noted by FASB members now on IASB, the U.S. board went down that pathbecause it tries wherever possible to avoid affording choices in accounting.The impairment-only method is favored by many in commerce because itprevents the drag on earnings presented by the automatic writedown ofgoodwill.Tweedie Offers Project ProposalsOther topics that Tweedie suggested should be in the scope of IASB'spreliminary study leading to a rulemaking project on combinations are: jointventures, which Tweedie called a \"big escape route\" around the negativeeffects of the purchase method for combinations and goodwill amortization;dual listings of stock of otherwise joined enterprises, said to be anothermethod of accounting avoidance; and acquisition provisioning, a practice inthe United Kingdom.In Britain, where Tweedie headed the Accounting Standards Board in the 1990sand into 2000, the impairment test for goodwill in combinations is strongerthan the mechanism planned by FASB, the IASB chairman said. However, asTweedie and an IASB colleague, Warren McGregor, noted, the economy largelyhas been strong over the last several years. Thus, the impairment approachhasn't undergone a \"stress test\" to see how well it works, as McGregor said.\n",

I think the diagnostic measure should be, for each commodity DPR a report daily of all those signed off as final (note I do not neccessarily mean \"officialized\") after the relevant market opening time (usuaully 7.30 am)Timely confirmation and execution of transactions (completeness, accuracy, existence)Monthly report of all unmatched confirmations:- outstanding inward confirmations (i.e. sent out, not signed) - outstanding outward confirmations (i.e deal done, confirm not sent) - outstanding mismatched or disputed confirmationsshowing deal trade date, start date, commodity, counterparty, MTM value, agedSettlements with counterparties occurs accurately and timely (non CACS, non Dashed deals)Monthly report of cumulative amounts of all unmatched or unapplied cash:Unapplied cash by counterparty, in original denomination, including deal reference if anyUnmatched amounts by deal, where settled amount differs from maturing forward MTM valueOne additional thing that ocurred to me was the fact that those responsible for supplying the information are also those responsible for the operation underlying it in some sense, so the obvious pitfalls of self - assessment will come into play here.

We analyze historical data from various countries to understand how different approaches to interest rate adjustments, money supply control, and other tools influence macroeconomic stability over extended periods.\\n\\nIntroduction:\\nMonetary policy plays a crucial role in shaping the economic landscape of nations. Central banks use monetary policy as a primary instrument for managing inflation and fostering sustainable growth. However, the long-term implications of these policies are often debated among economists.\\n\\nObjectives:\\nThe main objectives of this study are to: \\n1. Investigate the relationship between monetary policy decisions and long-term economic growth.\\n2. Analyze how different monetary policy strategies affect inflation rates over extended periods.\\n3. Provide insights into optimal monetary policy frameworks for promoting stable, sustainable economic development.\\n\\nMethodology:\\nWe employ a panel data analysis approach using time-series and cross-sectional data from 20 countries spanning the last four decades (1980-2020). Our dataset includes variables such as GDP growth rates, inflation rates, interest rates, money supply measures, and other relevant macroeconomic indicators.\\n\\nWe apply various econometric models to assess the impact of monetary policy on long-term economic growth and inflation. These include fixed effects regression analysis, dynamic panel data models, and cointegration tests for examining long-run relationships between variables.\\n\\nResults:\\nOur findings suggest that expansionary monetary policies tend to stimulate short-term economic growth but may lead to higher inflation rates in the long run. Conversenaslly, contractionary policies can help control inflation but might hinder immediate growth prospects.\\n\\nWe also observe significant differences in the effectiveness of various monetary policy tools across countries and time periods. For instance, unconventional measures like quantitative easing appear to have mixed effects on long-term economic performance, depending on specific country contexts.\\n\\nConclusion:\\nOur study highlights the importance of carefully calibrating monetary policies to balance short-term growth objectives with long-term inflation control. Policymakers should consider a range of factors, including historical data trends and global economic conditions, when designing optimal monetary policy frameworks.\\n\\nRecommendations:\\n1. Central banks should adopt flexible approaches that allow for adjustments based on evolving economic circumstances.\\n2. Continuous monitoring and evaluation of the impacts of monetary policies are essential to ensure their effectiveness in promoting sustainable growth and stable inflation rates.\\n3. Further research is needed to explore the long-term effects of unconventional monetary policy tools, such as negative interest rates and large-scale asset purchases.\\n\\nKeywords:\\nMonetary Policy, Long-Term Growth, Inflation Dynamics, Panel Data Analysis, Econometric Models, Economic Stability\"\n",

      "4520 2976 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- There may one good thing that comes out of the Enron Corp. (ENE) financial mess - stricter accounting rules governing consolidation of financial results.Enron acknowledged earlier Thursday that it incorrectly accounted for its relationships with related partnerships by keeping them off its financial statements. It corrected that mistake by consolidating the partnerhips into its results, a move that led Enron to restate three years worth of earnings, lowering them by a collective $586 million. Under current accounting regulations, companies don't have to consolidate loss or income from entities in which they have an interest below 51%, keeping those losses or gains off their books (the balance sheets and income statements). The Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, has been working on a project that would replace the standard of ownership by a more encompassing one of control. But that project has been languishing since 1982 when the board first started considering the issue. \"This is an area where FASB is struggling\" to set new criteria, said Alan Bromberg, a professor of corporate and securities law at the Dedeman School of Law of The Southern Methodist University. FASB has struggled in part because companies were fighting the changes and it has had difficulty in defining control to mean something other than majority ownership. The Enron's restatement and consolidation is also focusing attention on another arcane accounting rule, one dealing with minimum ownership by unaffiliated outsiders. Under a statement made by the Securities and Exchange Commission during an Emerging Issue Task Force meeting over a decade ago, the SEC stated that a minimum outside investment was needed for the special purpose entity to qualify for non consolidation. This guideline has remained in effect ever since. According to EITF documents dated 1989 and 1990, a minimum outside investment of 3% or more in a special purpose entity may be necessary, depending on the credit risk, for it to qualify for non-consolidation status. Given that some of the special entities created by Enron were controlled by some of its former executives, experts said it's possible that the SEC was considering the outside ownership of these entities insufficient for them to qualify for non consolidation. Meanwhile, it's unclear how Arthur Andersen LLP, Enron's independent auditor since the late 1980s, will be affected by the company's restatement and recent financial turmoil. A spokesman for Arthur Andersen said his firm \"continues to cooperate with Enron and its special committee to bring a resolution to this matter.\" The accounting giant has had some recent run-ins with shareholders and regulators because of accounting issues. It recently agreed to pay $110 million to settle a shareholder lawsuit over audits it conducted for Sunbeam Corp. Sunbeam had been accused of overstating its revenues and subsequently went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\n",

The topic of intangibles was thesubject of extended debate among FASB's seven members as they weighed itsimportance in allocating staff resources to such a project or to two otherissues vying for the attention of rulemakers. FASB heard arguments from one board member, John Wulff, suggesting that aneffort to simplify and codify standards and other guidance that formstatements of generally accepted principles, together with writing standardson revenue recognition and defining liability, may be more suitablecandidates for rulemaking. Major U.S. corporations, through at least onetrade group, the Institute of Management Accountants, counseled the coursedescribed by Wulff, a former leader of Financial Executive International'sCommittee on Corporate Reporting. That committee opposes FASB's taking onthe performance reporting and intangibles projects as outlined in aprospectus issued about two months ago. FASB settled on a compromise plan offered by board Chairman Edmund Jenkins.In the compromise, the panel's staff will carry out further preparatory workon intangible assets. At the same time, FASB's staff will study the threepotential projects--revenue recognition and liability definition,simplification and codification of accounting rules, and disclosures aboutintangibles--with an eye toward deciding an appropriate use of staffaccountants' time. The additional work on intangibles is to focus onsummarizing existing research on such non-concrete assets as in-processresearch and development, patents, and customer lists, with particular focuson questions about what information on intangibles is useful to investors,security analysts, and other users of financial statements. FASB would notcarry out polling or surveys, the board emphasized. The board tentativelyset a deadline of Dec. 24 for completion of the two-pronged work by itsstaff. That timetable would suggest FASB plans to make a more definitivedecision on adding a second, or even a third, standard-setting project inearly 2002.\n",

      "3460 1916 A 'Very Difficult Time' Some audit controls, such as using computers to spot financial conflicts of interest with prospective clients, improved during four years of SEC prodding, Bowsher said. Other shortcomings continue because of resistance in the accounting industry, he said. \"We were pushing on some of these issues, but we were having a very difficult time having these things improved,'' Bowsher said in an interview. Peer reviews and accounting oversight are in the forefront of debate about audit regulations in the wake of Enron's collapse. The energy trader blamed bookkeeping errors, in financial statements certified by Andersen, for the need to restate earnings going back to 1997. Still, Andersen got unqualified good marks in its latest peer review, released Jan. 2. Andersen's reviewer, Deloitte & Touche LLP, looked at 240 audits after Andersen asked its rival for tougher-than-normal scrutiny while questions swirled about Enron. Enron's audit was not among those examined.Pitt's Proposal Pitt's outline for change calls for the SEC to work with the biggest accounting firms to create a private oversight body, with funding from outside the accounting industry, to monitor and discipline auditors. Former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt, who appointed Turner, said last week that Pitt's proposal ``needs more teeth.'' An April 1997 letter, the earliest released under the freedom of information request, questioned whether cost saving in the name of efficiency was hurting the quality of audits and producing fewer records than peer reviewers needed. \"Some changes being undertaken in pursuit of operating goals, such as reducing audit hours and focusing audit objectives on increasing the perceived value of the audit to client management, may have the effect of compromising audit quality,'' wrote Michael Sutton, who was then SEC's chief accountant. He declined to comment on the letters.Peer Review\n",

Peer reviews and accounting oversight are in the forefront of debate about audit regulations in the wake of Enron's collapse.

Still, Andersen got unqualified good marks in its latest peer review, released Jan. 2.

      "\n",
      "# Answer\n",
      "In \"Macbeth,\" William Shakespeare explores the theme of unchecked ambition and its dire consequences primarily through the character arc of Macbeth. Initially introduced as a valiant warrior, Macbeth is quickly seduced by the prophecies of three witches who foretell his rise to power. His ambitious nature is further stoked when Lady Macbeth convinces him to murder King Duncan in order to fulfill their shared ambition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shakespeare conveys this theme through several key aspects:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Character Transformation**: As the play progresses, Macbeth's character undergoes a dramatic transformation from a noble and honorable man into a tyrannical ruler consumed by paranoia and guilt. This change is marked by his increasing reliance on supernatural elements (like the witches) to guide him, reflecting how ambition can lead one down a path of moral decay.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Language and Imagery**: Shakespeare uses vivid imagery and language to depict Macbeth's internal struggle with his ambitions. For instance, after Duncan’s murder, Macbeth hallucinates a bloody dagger leading him towards the king's chamber, symbolizing how his unchecked ambition has led him into a dark, guilt-ridden world.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Written in a letter to his friend Banquo, Shakespeare might have used this medium to reflect on Macbeth’s journey and its broader implications for humanity. The letter could serve as an introspective piece where Macbeth contemplates the consequences of his actions, offering insights into how ambition can corrupt even those with noble intentions at first.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Consequences**: Shakespeare meticulously illustrates the catastrophic outcomes that follow Macbeth's unchecked ambition—not only for him but also for Scotland and its people, who suffer under his tyrannical rule. The play culminates in a cycle of violence and retribution, highlighting how ambition can lead to self-destruction and the downfall of those around you.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Comparison with Other Characters**: By contrasting Macbeth's tragic end with characters like Banquo (whose descendants are prophesied to inherit the throne), Shakespeare underscores how ambition can lead to vastly different destinies based on one’s choices and moral compass.\n",
      "\n",
      "Through these elements, Shakespeare masterfully conveys that while ambition is a natural human drive, it becomes destructive when pursued without ethical boundaries or consideration for its consequences. Macbeth's journey from hero to tyrant serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of allowing ambition to override one’s moral integrity and sense of justice.\n",

      "\n",
      "Abstract: This paper examines how climate change is affecting global food security, with a focus on agricultural innovations that can mitigate these effects. It discusses the challenges faced by farmers worldwide due to changing weather patterns, extreme events, and shifting ecosystems. The study also explores various technological advancements in agriculture, such as drought-resistant crops, precision farming techniques, and vertical farming, which have the potential to enhance food production while reducing environmental impact.\n",
      "\n",
      "Introduction: Climate change poses a significant threat to global food security by disrupting traditional farming practices and altering crop yields. The increasing frequency of extreme weather events like droughts, floods, and heatwaves has led to unpredictable growing seasons, soil degradation, and loss of biodiversity. These challenges necessitate the development of innovative solutions that can help maintain food production levels while minimizing negative environmental consequences.\n",
      "\n",
      "Body: 1. Impact of climate change on global food security: This section will discuss how rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and increased frequency of extreme weather events are affecting crop yields, livestock productivity, and overall agricultural output worldwide. It will also examine the implications for vulnerable populations who rely heavily on subsistence farming to meet their food needs.\n",
      "2. Agricultural innovations: This section will explore various technological advancements in agriculture that can help address climate change-related challenges, including genetically modified crops, precision farming techniques (e.g., GPS mapping and remote sensing), vertical farming, and alternative protein sources like insects and lab-grown meat.\n",
      "3. Case studies: This section will present real-world examples of how agricultural innovations have been successfully implemented in different regions to improve food security while reducing environmental impact. Examples may include the use of drought-resistant crops in sub-Saharan Africa, precision farming techniques in Southeast Asia, and vertical farming initiatives in urban areas like Singapore.\n",
      "4. Policy recommendations: This section will provide policy suggestions for governments, international organizations, and other stakeholders to promote agricultural innovation and support the adoption of climate-smart practices that can enhance global food security while reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n",
      "5. Conclusion: The paper will summarize key findings from the research and emphasize the importance of continued investment in agricultural innovations as a means to address the challenges posed by climate change on global food security. It will also highlight the need for collaborative efforts among governments, private sector entities, and civil society organizations to ensure that these technologies are accessible and affordable for farmers worldwide.\n",

      "Introduction:\n",
      "Climate change is one of the most pressing issues facing our planet today. It has far-reaching impacts on ecosystems, economies, and societies worldwide. In this article, we will explore the causes and consequences of climate change, as well as potential solutions to mitigate its effects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Causes of Climate Change:\n",
      "The primary cause of climate change is human activity, particularly the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas. This process releases large amounts of greenhouse gases (GHGs) into the atmosphere, including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). These GHGs trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, leading to a gradual increase in global temperatures.\n",
      "\n",
      "Deforestation is another significant contributor to climate change. Trees absorb CO2 from the atmosphere during photosynthesis, but when forests are cleared or degraded, this carbon storage capacity is lost. Additionally, land-use changes such as urbanization and agriculture can also contribute to GHG emissions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Industrial processes, transportation, and energy production all play a role in climate change by releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Furthermore, natural factors like volcanic eruptions and solar radiation variations have minor contributions compared to human-induced causes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consequences of Climate Change:\n",
      "Climate change has numerous consequences for our planet, including rising global temperatures, melting ice caps and glaciers, sea level rise, ocean acidification, extreme weather events, and shifts in ecosystems and biodiversity. These impacts can have severe implications for human societies as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rising temperatures lead to heatwaves, droughts, and wildfires, which threaten agriculture, water resources, and public health. Melting ice caps contribute to sea level rise, putting coastal communities at risk of flooding and erosion. Ocean acidification affects marine life by reducing the availability of calcium carbonate needed for shell formation in organisms like corals, mollusks, and plankton.\n",
      "\n",
      "Climate change also disrupts ecosystems and biodiversity, as species struggle to adapt to changing conditions or migrate to more suitable habitats. This can lead to the extinction of vulnerable species and a loss of essential ecosystem services such as pollination, water purification, and carbon sequestration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, climate change exacerbates social inequalities by disproportionately affecting marginalized communities who often have fewer resources to cope with its impacts. These consequences can lead to political instability, economic decline, and increased migration as people seek better living conditions elsewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "Potential Solutions:\n",
      "Addressing climate change requires a multi-faceted approach that involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions, adapting to the changes already occurring, and promoting sustainable development practices. Some potential solutions include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Transitioning to renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, hydroelectric, and geothermal power to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.\n",
      "2. Improving energy efficiency in buildings, transportation, and industry by adopting cleaner technologies and practices.\n",
      "3. Promoting sustainable land use practices like reforestation, afforestation, and agroforestry to enhance carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation.\n",
      "4. Implementing policies that encourage the adoption of low-carbon technologies and discourage high-emission activities through mechanisms such as carbon pricing or cap-and-trade systems.\n",
      "5. Investing in research, development, and deployment of innovative solutions like carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology to remove CO2 from the atmosphere.\n",
      "6. Enhancing climate resilience by building infrastructure that can withstand extreme weather events and developing strategies for adapting agriculture, water management, and coastal protection systems.\n",
      "7. Raising public awareness about climate change and promoting behavior changes such as reducing energy consumption, using public transportation, recycling, and supporting sustainable products and services.\n",
      "8. Strengthening international cooperation to address the global nature of climate change through agreements like the Paris Agreement and other collaborative initiatives that promote knowledge sharing, technology transfer, and financial support for developing countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion:\n",
      "Climate change is a complex issue with far-reaching consequences for our planet and its inhabitants. However, by understanding its causes and impacts, we can work together to develop effective solutions that mitigate the effects of climate change while promoting sustainable development. It will require collective action from governments, businesses, communities, and individuals worldwide to ensure a more resilient future for generations to come.\n",

I hate to say that I have lost track. --Sally Lynn Tippery02/21/2 Written by Dr. Jane Smith, a renowned psychologist specializing in cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), discusses the impact of social media on adolescent self-esteem and body image issues. The article includes references to recent studies conducted between 2018 and 2023. Dr. Smith's analysis highlights both positive and negative aspects, with a focus on how CBT can be applied to mitigate the risks associated with social media use among teenagers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The article is structured as follows: an introduction that sets the stage for the discussion; a literature review summarizing key findings from relevant research; an analysis section where Dr. Smith applies CBT principles to interpret these findings and their implications on adolescent self-esteem; and finally, a conclusion with recommendations for parents, educators, and mental health professionals.\n",
      "\n",
      "The article also features interviews with three teenagers who have experienced varying degrees of social media influence on their lives, providing real-world context to the theoretical analysis. Dr. Smith concludes that while social media can exacerbate body image issues and lower self-esteem in some adolescents, it also offers opportunities for positive reinforcement and community building when used mindfully.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Introduction:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Jane Smith opens the article with an overview of how social media has become a pervasive force in adolescents' lives, affecting their self-esteem and body image. She emphasizes the importance of understanding these impacts through the lens of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to develop effective interventions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Literature Review:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The literature review synthesized recent studies from 2018 to 2023, revealing a mixed bag of effects social media has on adolescents. Some research indicates increased feelings of inadequacy and body dissatisfaction due to constant exposure to idealized images, while other studies suggest that social media can foster supportive communities and positive self-expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Analysis:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Smith applies CBT principles to interpret these findings, noting how negative thought patterns about oneself are often reinforced by the curated content on social platforms. She discusses cognitive distortions such as 'comparison' and 'social exclusion,' which can lead to lowered self-esteem among teenagers. However, she also points out that CBT techniques like challenging irrational beliefs and fostering a growth mindset can help adolescents develop resilience against these negative influences.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Interviews with Teenagers:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The article includes interviews with three teenagers, each providing unique insights into their personal experiences with social media. One interviewed teenager reported feeling pressured to conform to unrealistic beauty standards, while another found solace in online support groups that helped improve self-esteem. The third shared how they used CBT strategies learned from therapy sessions to navigate the challenges of social media more effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion and Recommendations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Smith concludes by offering recommendations for various stakeholders. She advises parents to monitor their children's social media use, educators to incorporate digital literacy into curricula, and mental health professionals to consider CBT as a therapeutic approach when addressing self-esteem issues related to social media.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Integration of CBT Principles:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The integration of CBT principles in Dr. Smith's analysis is robust, with clear examples of how cognitive distortions are identified and addressed through the lens of CBT. She effectively demonstrates how these therapy techniques can be applied to real-life scenarios involving social media use among adolescents.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Potential Limitations and Further Research:**\n",
      "\n",
      "While Dr. Smith's article provides valuable insights, potential limitations include a lack of longitudinal data on the long-term effects of social media on self-esteem. Future research could explore these impacts over time and investigate how CBT interventions can be tailored to different demographics within the adolescent population. Additionally, more studies are needed to understand the role of emerging technologies like virtual reality in shaping body image perceptions among teenagers.\n",

      "4297 2753 01/03/2002Chicago TribuneNorth Sports Final ; N3(Copyright 2002 by the Chicago Tribune)Accounting firm Andersen said Wednesday that its auditing practice responsible for checking the books of bankrupt energy trader Enron Corp. has been given a clean bill of health in a peer review by another accounting firm, but some observers criticized the findings. The review, performed by rival Big Five firm Deloitte & Touche, was part of an assessment carried out once every three years to check the quality of financial reporting of top firms.Andersen's accounting systems were \"deemed to provide reasonable assurance of compliance with professional standards,\" according to a statement from the Chicago-based firm. \"Deloitte's opinion was unmodified, without qualification,\" for the year ended Aug. 31, Andersen added. But the integrity of the process was criticized almost immediately by analysts, including professor Lynn Turner, a former Securities and Exchange Commission chief accountant and current director of the Center for Quality Financial Reporting at Colorado State University. \"If the process was really credible, I don't think we'd be having the rash of problems we are having today,\" Turner said. Turner cited reporting problems that have cost investors billions of dollars at Enron, such other Andersen clients as Waste Management Inc. and Sunbeam Corp., and similar high-profile failures at Cendant Corp., Rite Aid Corp. and MicroStrategy Inc. after audits by other accounting firms. Critics of the peer review process point to the fact that since the cooperative assessments began in 1978, no Big Five accounting firm has received a qualified opinion of its accounting procedures from a rival. When Enron filed for bankruptcy protection in December, it was Andersen's Houston office's largest client. The energy trader's collapse is the subject of a SEC investigation, lawsuits and a number of congressional probes. According to Deloitte's letter of comment, which accompanied the unqualified opinion, Andersen was told about a need to improve minor documentation and communication problems. Andersen's peer review was all but complete when it asked in November for the review to be expanded to include the Houston office responsible for auditing Enron, which had disclosed financial reporting problems that led to $1.2 billion being chopped from shareholders' equity. The assessment did not look specifically at the audit Andersen performed on Enron, because there is \"pending litigation\" over reporting problems, according to Deloitte's letter.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Rosenthal said a current Tax Courtcase involves the Internal Revenue Service disputing a company's use of a\"credit adjustment\" to reduce income.Price said the rules allow companies to elect to use \"hedgeaccounting.\" He said a company which recognized gain or loss from aderivative identified as a hedge could have an offsetting gain or loss fromthe item being hedged. Thus, hedge accounting reduces the volatility createdby FAS 133 for companies that hedge their risk. However, FAS 133 contains astrict definition for a hedge, and an item could lose its character as ahedge because the definition is reapplied every quarter to the same item.The panelists noted that for tax purposes, once an item is considered ahedge, its character would not change subsequently.Price said the new FASB rule applies to entities that reportto the Securities Exchange Commission and are effective for fiscal yearsbeginning after June 15, 2000, and Jan. 1, 2001, for companies reporting ona calendar year.Ops Execs See Raised ProfileOperations Management - November 27, 2000Operations and technology executives are taking on a larger role withinfirms and ate receiving more senior job titles as a result, according to aRussell Reynolds Associates study to be released this week. \"The head ofoperations is no longer just a senior v.p., but is now at the partnerlevel,\" said George Wilbanks, partner with Russell Reynolds.The shift has been prompted by a number of factors, including the blurringof lines between banks, insurers,mutual fund firms and other financial services companies, and the growingimportance of multiple channels and the subsequent complexity of operationsand information. \"Firms need much more robust technology and operationsplatforms to handle the added complexity,\" Wilbanks said. The study - 2000Recruiting Trends in Investment Management\" - also found an increase in thenumber of searches in operations, because many firms do not have someone inplace who can take on a more executive role.U.K Association Sets Up Think TankOperations Management - November 27, 2000.The Computing Services and Software Association, the U.K. trade associationfor the IT services and software sector, is establishing a think tank toinvestigate applied technology in the financial and business sectors.

He said a company which recognized gain or loss from an derivative identified as a hedge could have an offsetting gain or loss from the item being hedged. Thus, hedge accounting reduces the volatility created by FAS 133 for companies that hedge their risk. However, FAS 133 contains strict definition for a hedge, and an item could lose its character as a hedge because the definition is reapplied every quarter to the same item. The panelists noted that for tax purposes, once an item is considered a hedge, its character would not change subsequently.\"\n",

      "4258 2714 October 2001 - Andersen's concerns mushroom about how Enron will report its third-quarter results, and whether the report will pass muster legally and reflect generally accepted accounting practices. Oct. 9, Andersen hires an outside law firm to advise the firm amid its growing concern about the Enron account, indicating Andersen was becoming concerned about its legal liability. Oct. 12, Temple sends an e-mail to an Andersen executive, who forwarded it to Duncan, in which the Andersen attorney says: \"It might be useful to consider reminding the (Enron) engagement team of our documentation and retention policy. It will be helpful to make sure we have complied with the policy.\" The policy addresses \"organization, retention and destruction\" of client information. Also Oct. 12, Duncan receives a draft press release from Enron in which the company plans to describe its $1 billion charge against income as a nonrecurring item. Three days later, Duncan sends a memo to \"the files\" outlining his Oct. 14 discussion with Enron Chief Accounting Officer Rick Causey. Duncan voiced \"strong concerns\" that describing the charge as nonrecurring \"could be misconstrued or misunderstood by investors.\" Duncan also noted that he informed Causey that Andersen was aware of enforcement actions undertaken by the Securities and Exchange Commission \"in cases where they believe such a presentation was materially misleading.\" Oct. 15, Enron issued a press release describing the charge as nonrecurring. Oct. 16, Temple sends an e-mail to Duncan advising him to delete her name from the memo about Andersen's concerns about Enron's handling of the third-quarter press release. \"Reference to the legal group consultation arguably is a waiver of attorney-client privileged advice and if my name is mentioned it increases the chances that I might be a witness, which I prefer to avoid.\" Around Oct. 19-20, Duncan learns the SEC has launched a formal inquiry of Enron's financial records and reporting. He informs the Andersen consultation group, which includes Temple. Oct. 22, Duncan and the Andersen auditing team meet with Causey, Enron's chief accounting officer, to discuss the SEC probe. Oct. 23, Duncan convenes an \"urgent meeting\" of the Enron auditing team, at which he organizes a concerted effort to destroy a \"significant\" number of documents of interest to SEC and congressional investigators, Andersen executives testify. Oct. 24, Enron fires Fastow, its chief financial officer. Oct. 25, Enron issues a notice advising that preservation of documents is required by law, given that the company was being sued by investors. The Duncan-led document destruction would continue through the first 10 days of November.\n",

Revised Draft ? Conference Call on Tuesday, January 16th, 2:00 p.m.Based on discussion at our last conference call and follow-up conversationswith some EPSA members, attached is a significantly revised list of GuidingPrinciples on Market Monitoring for FERC's staff technical conference onJanuary 23rd to develop market monitoring procedures for the Cal ISOmarkets. The most significant change from the prior draft is that we nowdelete any reference to specific price levels that would screen prices inCalifornia and focuses instead why a price-based analysis for marketmonitoring is inappropriate, since it fails to account for capacity costs,opportunity costs and scarcity values.FERC Staff has asked that EPSA be prepared to make a presentation at theJanuary 23rd conference, so it is important that we see if there isconsensus on this approach. We will discuss this draft on a conferencecall on Tuesday, January 16th at 2:00 p.m. (EST).

      "4301 2757 11/12/2001The Wall Street JournalC1(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)What could Arthur Andersen have done to protect the investing public from Enron? Brushing up on a basic accounting textbook might have helped, some critics say. Confirming investors' fears, the Houston energy trader Thursday filed a lengthy disclosure document with the Securities and Exchange Commission declaring that its financial statements going back to 1997 \"should not be relied upon\" and will have to be restated. Among other problems, Enron acknowledged overstating its net income by a total of $586 million, or 20%. Enron's financial statements long have been widely assailed as indecipherable. Now, it turns out, they were just plain wrong.But what is most striking about the latest disclosures is that they show Enron's misstatements weren't limited merely to judgment calls and gray areas for the green-eyeshade crowd to debate. Portions of Enron's accounting practices amounted to violations of elementary accounting principles, some accounting specialists say. Citing client-confidentiality rules, an Andersen spokesman, David Tabolt, declines to comment on his firm's work for Enron, which on Friday agreed to be bought by crosstown rival Dynegy. He calls Enron's disavowal of its previous financial statements an \"unfortunate situation\" and says Andersen is cooperating with the SEC's Enron investigation and the special committee formed by Enron to investigate the company's accounting and disclosure practices. Consider the primary reason for the $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity that Enron revealed in mid-October, sparking much of the downdraft in the company's shares. At the time, Enron said the reduction came about because it had decided to unwind certain transactions with some limited partnerships with which it had done business. On Thursday, however, Enron acknowledged that the original accounting for the transactions violated generally accepted accounting principles. Starting in early 2000, the company said last week, Enron issued shares of its own common stock to four \"special-purpose entities,\" in exchange for which it received a note receivable. Enron said it had increased both its note-receivable assets and shareholder equity, a move the company called \"an accounting error\" that it is correcting. Under GAAP, the payment a company receives when issuing stock only counts as equity if it is cash. As a result, Enron's 2000 audited financial statements overstated the company's notes-receivable assets and shareholder equity by $172 million. And Enron's 2001 unaudited statements overstated them by $828 million. The $1 billion overstatement represents 8.5% of Enron's previously reported shareholder equity as of June 30.\n",

The recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by Enron have raised significant concerns regarding their financial reporting.\\n\\nEnron's acknowledgment of overstating net income by $586 million, or 20%, is a stark reminder of how critical accurate accounting practices are to investor trust. The disclosure that Enron's financial statements should not be relied upon and will require restatement further emphasizes the gravity of this situation.\\n\\nMoreover, it has come to light that certain aspects of Enron's accounting may have violated fundamental principles of generally accepted accounting practices (GAAP). For instance, their issuance of shares in exchange for notes receivable was misrepresented as an increase in assets and equity. This practice not only distorts the true financial position but also undermines the reliability of financial statements.\\n\\nIn light of these revelations, it is essential to consider whether Arthur Andersen's oversight contributed to this situation. While we cannot comment on specific client engagements due to confidentiality agreements, it is crucial for us as professionals in the field to uphold our ethical responsibilities and ensure that such discrepancies are addressed promptly.\\n\\nLet's use this opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to high-quality accounting standards and work together to restore confidence among investors and stakeholders.\\n\\nSincerely,\\nJohn Doe\",\n",

      "\"The study of the human mind is a complex field that encompasses various disciplines such as psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, and linguistics. One key area within this domain is cognitive science, which focuses on understanding how people think, learn, remember, and communicate. Cognitive scientists employ an interdisciplinary approach to investigate the mental processes that underlie behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cognitive psychology specifically examines internal mental states such as perceptions, thoughts, reasoning, and emotions. It seeks to understand how people acquire, process, and store information. Cognitive neuroscience, on the other hand, looks at the neural mechanisms that underlie cognition, often using neuroimaging techniques like fMRI or EEG to study brain activity in relation to mental processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Philosophy of mind explores questions about consciousness and its relationship with the physical world, including debates on whether minds are purely materialistic (physicalist) or if there is a non-material aspect to our existence (dualism). Linguistics studies language as a cognitive function, investigating how it develops in individuals and societies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cognitive science also delves into artificial intelligence (AI), which attempts to create machines capable of performing tasks that would typically require human intelligence. This includes natural language processing, problem-solving, learning, and perception. AI researchers often draw inspiration from cognitive psychology and neuroscience to develop algorithms that mimic human thought processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the study of the mind is a multifacited field with various subdisciplines working together to unravel the complexities of human cognition. By integrating knowledge across these areas, researchers can gain deeper insights into how our minds function and evolve.\"\n",

      "4096 2552 Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Top Of The News Dan Ackman, Forbes.com, 02.01.02, 9:26 AM ET \"Divide and conquer\" is often a winning strategy. Enron's wrinkle has long been \"divide and disavow,\" and it seems that, for the bankrupt energy trader and its lawyers, old gambits die hard. One of the principal components of the Enron scandal was the company's practice of creating partnerships and then using them to push its assets or debts off its books. Technically this can be legal, so long as the partnerships are truly separate, which, among other things, means that outside investors control as little as 3% of the partnership equity. The myth of separation--while still strongly believed by Enron itself--is losing support among the accounting firms who have been tainted by Enron and other recent scandals. The Big Five accounting firms are coming around to the idea that providing certain consulting services to the same company it is auditing creates an inherent conflict and is bad business. Until recently, the accounting profession bitterly opposed any limits on its consulting services, beating back rule changes proposed by Arthur Levitt when he was chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. But the Enron taint has spread past Enron's own auditor, Arthur Andersen, and the firms are seeking to police themselves lest others--such as the SEC--do it for them. PricewaterhouseCoopers and KPMG said yesterday said they would support such proposals. Andersen itself is said to be leaning in that direction and that it will soon announce substantial changes in how it does business. The Walt Disney Co. approved of the new regime of separation yesterday when its chairman, Michael Eisner, said the company would not use its independent auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers, for any new consulting work and would evaluate the current projects the accounting firm's consultants are currently doing for the company. Disney in 2000 paid PricewaterhouseCoopers $8.7 million in audit fees and around $32 million in non-audit fees. PricewaterhouseCoopers, for its part, said it intended to spin off its consulting arm in an IPO, which could mollify Disney and others. Arthur Andersen, in 2000, separated from its old consulting arm, now known as Accenture, after a long-running dispute between the two sides of the firm. But since then, Andersen itself has beefed up its own consulting practice. According to a report in The New York Times, just over half the $52 million it billed Enron in 2000 was for consulting.\n",

The United Brotherhood of Carpenters, which controls $35 billion in pe=nsion assets, proposed the policy at several companies after reviewing the =ratio of audit to nonaudit fees. The SEC began requiring that companies dis=close that information as of the year 2000.=20Many of the companies were paying 10 to 15 times more for nonaudit-related =services than for auditing fees. Ed Durkin, director of special programs fo=r the United Brotherhood of Carpenters, says: \"The impression somebody coul=d get from looking at these numbers is that there might be issues of indepe=ndence and of the integrity of the financial-reporting system.\"=20But some say a blanket policy restricting the accounting relationship isn't= necessarily going to prevent an Enron-like blow-up. \"It's probably more a =matter of disclosure than limitations,\" says David Bowers, an analyst with =Evergreen Investment Management Co., which owns shares of PG&E. While inves=tors need to pay attention to what the accountants are doing, there is some= benefit to having a firm perform multiple duties, he says. \"It's hard to p=aint it over with a broad brush and say you can't have both relationships.\"==20Companies also note that some of the fees labeled as \"nonaudit\" under the n=ew SEC rules are for services traditionally provided by auditors, such as w=ork done on registration statements or on taxes. Renee Parnell, a spokeswom=an for PG&E, says the company often has to use its accounting firm, Deloitt=e & Touche LLP \"for things like regulatory filings,\" adding that PG&E is \"s=eeking SEC recommendation on whether to include the proposal\" in its proxy.= A spokeswoman for Disney declined to comment beyond what is written in the= proxy, which recommends that shareholders vote against the proposal. Repre=sentatives from Apple, Motorola and Johnson & Johnson declined to comment.==20The shareholders' proposals aren't original in this sense: Two years ago, f=ormer SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr. sought to limit dual auditing/consulti=ng roles for accounting firms. But his plan met fierce resistance from the =accounting industry and its lobbyists, as well as from members of Congress,= and he backed down, settling for less-stringent limits on certain types of= nonauditing work.

      "4417 2873 In a speech at the American Enterprise Institute, Bolkestein reaffirmed theEuropean Union's commitment to requiring all E.U.-based companies to use theInternational Accounting Standards (IAS) practices in their record keepingin order to enhance transparency and provide higher quality financialinformation to investors across the world.\"The use of one global accounting language will greatly benefit Europeancompanies. It will help them compete on equal terms for global capital,\"Bolkestein said. He added that the legislation would require companies tobegin preparing their consolidated accounts using IAS by 2005.Bolkestein also said he is hopeful that the U.S. Securities and ExchangeCommission will begin to accept financial statements prepared by firms inthe European Union without requiring them to be reconciled with thegenerally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) standard used in the UnitedStates.A major reason that changes are needed in the European Union's financialregulations is because of the \"unprecedented volume of mergers andacquisitions\" between American and European firms.Another reason is that the European Union has established a goal of becoming\"the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world,capable of sustainable growth with more and better jobs, and greater socialcohesion,\" Bolkestein said.Since 1990, Bolkestein said the European community has added 900,000 jobsand has seen improved competition and productivity add 1.5 percent to grossdomestic product growth because of measures taken to create a single marketfor financial services.If the European Union is successful at restructuring its financial system by2005, Bolkestein said he sees other benefits to include a lower cost ofcapital for all companies, a deeper and more vibrant venture capital market,lower costs of purchasing financial products, and higher returns on pensionsand investment funds.To realize those benefits, Bolkestein said the European Commission wouldlike to see an integrated securities market in place by 2003, replacing theindividual domestic securities markets of the European Union's 15 memberstates.\"Mergers and alliances between existing exchanges are already breaking downbarriers, pooling liquidity, reducing clearing costs, decreasing volatility,and increasing transparency,\" Bolkestein said. He added that Europe is alsoseeing \"a marked increase in the number of on-line brokerage accounts, whichfurther contributes to efficiency and transparency,\" but also creates agreater need for changes in the way the European Union regulates itsfinancial sector.Top securities lawyer set to head SECFinancial Times - May 11, 2001By John LabatePresident George W.

Fed's Greenspan Comments on `Egregious' Accounting at Enron2002-01-24 12:40 (New York) Washington, Jan. 24 (Bloomberg) -- The following are comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on accounting practices at Enron Corp. Greenspan's remarks came during the question-and-answer part of testimony to the Senate Budget Committee. ``I think that the extraordinary response to Enron is something I think is very helpful and indeed an indication that the people in this society have required that we maintain a very high standard of trustworthiness in our business operations,'' Greenspan said. ``If everybody did what is alleged in the Enron accounting system, our system could not work,'' he said. ``That is, if you have a system, a market system, it works off information. If you don't have a way to evaluate a particular asset you cannot price it and if you cannot price it you cannot get the appropriate allocation of capital in a market society.'' As to Enron's accounting practices, Greenspan said: ``I think that was an egregious act. I tried as hard as I could to find an economic reason why those affiliates were constructed the way they were. The simplest explanation was the obvious explanation: that they did not want to indicate what their true earnings position was.'' Greenspan said he would be concerned about Enron's practices harming the economy ``if there wasn't a reaction to it.'' ``But the reaction, I think, is going to create a really major rethinking by a lot of people about whether there is a spin game going on with respect to the information coming out of business into the investment community,'' he said. While ``there's been an element of that'' in the past, ``I think there's going to be a good deal less of that. The old issue of competing for reputation is going to re-emerge. And I think you're going to find at some point that there are going to be people out there who are going to say `our accounts you can rely on' and that probably will increase their price-earnings ratios.''--Michael McKee in Washington (202) 624-1895 or mmckee@bloomberg.net.

The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (A=ICPA), the industry's professional association, points out that accountants= examine the books of more than 15,000 public companies every year; they ar=e accused of errors in just 0.1% of those audits. But oh, the price of thos=e few failures. Lynn Turner, former chief accountant of the Securities and =Exchange Commission, estimates that investors have lost more than $100 bill=ion because of financial fraud and the accompanying earnings restatements s=ince 1995.=20Perhaps the most glaring example of self-regulation's deficiency has been a=ccountants' unwillingness to deal with conflicts of interest. Over the year=s, the major auditing firms have transformed themselves into \"professional =services\" companies that derive an increasing portion of revenues and profi=ts from consulting: selling computer systems, advising clients on tax shelt=ers, and evaluating their business strategies. In 1999, according to the SE=C, half of the Big Five's revenues came from consulting fees, vs. 13% in 19=81.=20Auditing, meanwhile, has become a commodity. Firms have even been accused o=f using it as a loss leader, a way of getting in the door at a company to s=ell more-profitable consulting contracts. \"Audit work is a marvelous market=ing tool,\" says Lou Lowenstein, a professor emeritus of finance and law at =Columbia University. \"You are already there doing the audit. You say their =internal controls are no good. Well, who are they going to call to fix it?\"= But this requires a firm to work for the public (auditing) and management =(consulting). \"You cannot serve them both,\" says former SEC commissioner Be=vis Longstreth.=20This conflict may have played a role at Enron. Andersen received $25 millio=n in auditing fees from Enron last year. That's money Andersen was paid bot=h as Enron's outside auditor, certifying its financial statements, and as i=ts internal auditor, making sure Enron had the right systems to keep its bo=oks and working to detect fraud and irregularities. This double duty alone =raised a serious potential for conflict. Besides $25 million in accounting =fees, Andersen was paid $23 million for consulting services. \"If you are au=diting your own creations, it is very difficult to criticize them,\" says Ro=bert Willens, a Lehman Brothers tax expert who disapproves of the accountin=g profession's recent move into selling aggressive tax shelters. Andersen h=as not revealed the details of its work on Enron's highly controversial off=-balance-sheet transactions, but the accounting firms have never believed c=onsulting fees compromise their objectivity. \"They have militantly refused =to ever acknowledge the possibility of a problem,\" Longstreth says.\n",

[Fairley, David] The Marketing Strategy, the Trading and Risk Policy, and the Description of Asset Management have been upated. The other Exhibits have not been modified. The Marketing Strategy and Trading & Risk Policy have been discussed at length with MDEA (MDEA commercial, not legal), and their comments/questions incorporated.  7. It would help if theh commercial part of the team could send me the following, in words and/or formulae:The defn and method of establishing the bogey (target production cost) formula can be an exhibit, which would be great for the commercial team to work on. [Fairley, David] Thought we had this covered in the definitions and obligations of the parties. Will look at it again. Conceptually, MDEA, Services Group, and Orig are in full agreement, so we need to make sure that the contract language is clear enough.[Rorschach, Reagan] See attached exhibit detailing the calc with an example. Are we determined how we should deal with imbalances (part of cost of power)? [Fairley, David] There are three considerations on this: (1) who wears imbalance exposure?, (2) who manages imbalances (hourly type activity), and (3) who pays for imbalances? Imbalances are billed by Entergy directly to MDEA under their Network Services Agreement. EPMI's hourly desk manages the load/resource items hourly, but MDEA has the exposure (physical and price) to imbalances. Weather/load changes, and fluctuations in supply create hourly imbalances (they happen, they are uncontrollable, and we fix them) which EPMI's hourly desk manages as part of the imbalance service described in the definitions and obligations of the parties. A different section in the contract states that MDEA wears the exposure. How are we setting the bogey? Formula? [Fairley, David] The bogey is set when the load projection and stack models are run each day. Both parties participate by providing certain necessary info and discussing results and planning the day's activities. [Rorschach, Reagan] Records of bogey decisions will be archievedSubject to audit? [Fairley, David] Yes, but they would be auditing something that is jointly derived each day.

      "4458 2914 Enron and manage our engagement risks,\" the memo says.  During the discussion, the Andersen executives noted Enron's fees to the firmeventually could total $100 million a year -- an amount that would have madeEnron the accounting firm's biggest client by far. The executives discussedwhether their decision to retain Enron was colored by the size of the fees, andthe memo suggests they were concerned about whether too much of Andersen'sEnron income was coming from nonaudit advisory work. \"Such amounts did nottrouble the participants as long as the nature of the services was not anissue,\" the memo says.  David Tabolt, an Andersen spokesman, said he was unaware of the memo and themeeting it recounts. \"I am unable to provide any comment until I look intothis,\" he said. Accounting firms regularly review clients to determine ifauditing the books puts the accounting firm at risk. The Andersen memo doesn'tspecify if this was one of those regular meetings or if it was called for aparticular reason. Mr. Tabolt stressed that Andersen doesn't hesitate to droprisky clients for various reasons. \"We've dumped thousands of clients in recentyears,\" he said.  The memo was addressed to two Andersen officials, including David Duncan, whoheaded the Enron account and who Andersen this week said it fired foroverseeing the destruction of Enron-related documents after learning thatfederal regulators were examining the energy-trading company's finances.  Mr. Duncan was quizzed at length yesterday by investigators for the HouseEnergy and Commerce Committee and the Justice Department in separate,closed-door sessions. Much of the congressional questions related to theFebruary 2001 memo. Mr. Duncan told the investigators he called the meetingbecause he was aware the Enron account posed \"significant risk,\" according toone person present during the questioning. The memo provided a \"To Do\" listthat included recommending that Enron's board review the fairness oftransactions with the LJM partnership. Asked whether he followed up on that andother items on the list, Mr. Duncan answered \"no\" to most, often suggesting itwas the responsibility of others at the accounting firm.  The second memo, by another Andersen executive, recounts an Aug. 20, 2001,phone conversation with Enron Vice President Sherron Watkins, a former Andersenemployee who that same month alerted Enron Chief Executive Kenneth Lay topossible conflicts of interest and potential accounting irregularities that shefeared could bring the company down.  Congressional aides who have read the memo said it shows that Ms. Watkinsdetailed her concerns about Enron to an Andersen auditor. The three-page memoindicates Ms. Watkins's concerns were relayed to senior Andersen management,including Mr. Duncan.

Iexercise the restraint to which your story pines in many of myconsulting engagements which require financial give and take betweenclient and vendor. It is simply smart business to do so. I have beenthe beneficiary of the same with my local bank when errors occurred inmy checking accounts, or when loan payments were made absent mindedlylate, etc., and the late fee forgiven. However, much of our economy,and certainly the trade of a commodity such as electricity requires theuse of markets. Nameless and faceless, they do squeeze out all theefficiencies which lead to lower prices, more innovation, and a sharingof price risk with parties who are neither the ultimate consumer nor theinitial producer. The producer and consumer get out of the riskarbitrage and leave it to others who are more skilled and monied.I find it ironic that TURN, then, is so insistent on arguing, as it hasdone on many many occasions for the relaxation of market separation inthe ISO=01,s congestion management reform. Elimination of marketseparation is nothing more than the impersonal forcing of parties toexecute trades on either side of a congested transmission path in thename of market efficiency. Lower prices for consumers. Does it reallymatter if it is done through person to person transactions, or throughmarkets?Third, your story can be used to make an alternative point. Whathappens to the merchant in town when Wal-Mart moves into the next towndown the road? All the faithful customers that your Merchant ofVengeance was protecting suddenly migrate to a competitor with greaterinventory, more choice, and lower prices. What do you say, then? Thecorollary for us is direct. The new generation owners moved literallybillions of dollars into California, at risk, and took a chance. Itpaid off. They succeeded as we all know this year, and probably willnext year, and so on. But the 3,000 MW of new power plants underconstruction in California, and the 3,000 MW under construction inArizona, and the over 16,000 MW of combined power projects inCalifornia, Arizona, and Southern Nevada that are in line for permitswill change the financial landscape in a hurry once energized. Theprices will soften, returns will be less cherry, and I really want toknow, where will today=01,s accusers be when there is a shake out?Consumers will reap that benefit, oh you best believe it.

Using mark-to-market methods, a company calculates the fair market value of a commodity position - whether it's a contract, an option, a swap, etc. - at the time, even if the value of the position is realized over a longer period. The problem with this method is the actual cash a company realizes from the position might not be the same value the company calculated in its original assessment. Also, sometimes it isn't easy to calculate the fair value of the commodity position. This is particularly true in instances where the market for the commodity isn't liquid. Over time, companies with the highest level of disclosure regarding their mark-to-market gains will most likely trade at higher multiples to counterparts that provide little or no disclosure, said ABN AMRO Inc. analyst Paul Patterson. Encouragingly, it appears companies may already be responding to the call for added disclosure. According to a survey Patterson conducted, more companies with energy trading units were willing to disclose the details of their mark-to-market accounting practices during third-quarter conference calls compared with those in the second quarter. Patterson said he prefers earnings that are cash-based. \"All things being equal, we believe reported earnings that more closely reflect the timely realization of cash have a higher quality associated with them than earnings that do not,\" he said. He expects investors to become smarter and learn to distinguish between earnings growth through accrual accounting and growth fueled by mark-to-market accounting. At the end of the day, it is not a matter of simply producing profits, but being able to say where those earnings came from, said one investor, who manages a pension fund. Some investors also may be placing a greater emphasis on the cash flow the energy merchants produce. Tim O'Brien, portfolio manager of the Gabelli Utilities Fund, said energy merchants that own the physical power assets to back up their trading positions should trade at a premium to an independent power producers and traditional utility companies. Still, the stocks should be valued at less than the growth rate of the company because of their heavy exposures to commodity prices. Energy merchants include companies such as Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) and Dominion Resources Inc. (D). According to O'Brien, the group never deserved to have the price-to-earnings multiples above 20- to 30-times earnings, which were once paid for the stocks. \"We all got sucked up by the up-leg of the cycle and forgot just how cyclical these companies are,\" O'Brien said, adding that the average multiple should be in the high single-digits to the high-teens.\n",

But at the heart of the situation is an accounting technique that allows companies to include as current earnings those profits they expect to realize from energy-related contracts and other derivative instruments in future periods, sometimes stretching over more than 20 years. So-called mark-to-market accounting is mandated by accounting-rule makers when companies have outstanding energy-related contracts on their books at the end of a quarter, such as agreements to sell electricity or buy natural gas over a period of time at certain prices. Under those rules, companies estimate the fair market values of those contracts on their balance sheets each quarter as assets or liabilities. Changes in the value of a contract from quarter to quarter then are either added to or subtracted from net earnings. If, for instance, the market price for natural gas rises above the price specified in a company's contract to buy gas, generally the company will record an unrealized gain. That gain is recognized as income and recorded as an asset on the company's balance sheet. At the end of each quarter, the contract is revalued. The value of the previously recorded asset is increased, and any increase in unrealized gain is recorded as additional income. Conversely, if the market value for gas falls, and the value of the contract has declined, any change in the contract's value is recorded on the company's balance sheet, and a loss is recorded on its income statement. e Yet in their financial reports, the companies only vaguely describe the methods they use to come up with fair-value estimates on the contracts. Increasingly, quoted market prices offering independent guidance are becoming readily available for several years into the future. However, with some long-term derivative instruments, particularly electricity contracts, future market prices don't extend far enough to cover the full life of those contracts. And in those cases, companies are allowed to base valuations on their own undisclosed estimates, assumptions and pricing models. \"Ultimately they're telling you what they think the answer is, but they're not telling you how they got to that answer,\" says Stephen Campbell, an analyst at Business Valuation Services in Dallas. \"That is essentially saying `trust me.'\"\n",

      "4306 2762 Subject: The Press Behind the Stock Dip?Some of you may have seen the article in the WSJ already, but for those of us in Omaha (who don't typically get the Texas Edition) it was news to us. Not only is the article relevant because it apparently caused the stock to dip by $10, but the article elaborates on concerns that apply to a form of accounting that some of our commercial people would like to have apply to our business. I'm not sure the accounting rules would permit mark to market treatment for transport or storage contracts, but it may be appropriate for financial or commodity deals. DF---------------------- Forwarded by Drew Fossum/ET&S/Enron on 09/25/2000 ET & S Business Intelligence DepartmentSubject: The Press Behind the Stock Dip?TEXAS JOURNALEnergy Traders Cite Gains, But Some Math Is MissingBy Jonathan WeilStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal09/20/2000The Wall Street JournalTexas JournalT1(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)Volatile prices for natural gas and electricity are creating high-voltage earnings growth at some companies with large energy-trading units. But investors counting on these gains could be in for a jolt down the road. Shares of these companies have been on a tear lately. And some of the biggest players are in Houston, the center of the energy-trading industry. Dynegy Inc.'s stock is up more than fourfold so far this year at $53.438, and now trades for 41 times what analysts project the company's 2000 earnings will be, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. Shares of Enron Corp., the largest trader of gas and electricity in North America, have nearly doubled this year to $84.875, or 60 times earnings. Meanwhile, El Paso Energy Corp.'s stock has jumped 61% this year to $62.375, or 24 times earnings.Traders at these and other companies are capitalizing on the wild price swings and supply fluctuations that have accompanied deregulation in some regional markets. Natural-gas prices have more than doubled in the past year, while supplies have tightened. And the rapid price fluctuations for electricity have prompted many large businesses to seek price protection through hedging or fixed-price contracts, generating large premiums for traders. But what many investors may not realize is that much of these companies' recent profits constitute unrealized, noncash gains. Frequently, these profits depend on assumptions and estimates about future market factors, the details of which the companies do not provide, and which time may prove wrong. And because of minimal disclosure standards in these kinds of cases, it's difficult for investors to assess whose assumptions might be too aggressive, or what market changes might invalidate the assumptions -- and force earnings revisions.\n",

Otherspeakers included Mark Price and Steve Rosenthal of KPMG, and Chuck Wheelerof Alston & Bird.Price said Financial Accounting Standard No. 133, adopted in 1998 by theFinancial Accounting Standards Board and amended in June (118 DTR G-7,6/19/00), requires separate accounting for derivatives, using amark-to-market approach like that used under Internal Revenue Code Section475. The new rule requires that any change in the value of the derivative be\"booked\"--included as a gain or loss in determining the company's income forfinancial accounting purposes--even if the company has not disposed of thederivative.The result, Price said, is to create increased volatility in the company'sdetermination of income and loss for accounting purposes. Wheeler said thatcompanies do not want this increased volatility to apply to theirdeterminations of income for tax purposes.Price said the accounting profession adopted new standards for derivativesbecause of numerous problems, including:* incomplete reporting, in that some companies reported no informationor reported information only in a footnote;* inconsistent reporting, in that companies used different rules fordetermining cost and value;* difficulty in applying the accounting rules; and* lack of transparency, in that companies took different approaches intheir treatment of derivatives,meaning income was not determined under the same rules andinformation on financial statements could not be compared with reliability.Issues for Congress to StudyBuckley said the mark-to-market approach is slowly beingadopted in the tax system.

In aclosely related move, the FASB has also lately determined that effectivenext year, pure goodwill recorded on corporate balance sheets will no longerbe amortized, but will be subjected to an \"impairment\" approach.In a 14-page report, issued in mid May, a financial services firm, Friedman,Billings, Ramsey & Co. concluded that the net effects of these changes willbe bullish for stocks. \"We anticipate the psychological perception ofapplying current P/E ratios to higher future GAAP earnings will result inhigher stock prices,\" wrote the FBR's senior analyst, Laurie Hunsicker. Ms.Hunsicker acknowledges that the new accounting methods do not change theunderlying economic realities, but expects that psychology will trump suchmatters.Banks accountFinancial Times - May 28, 2001Who could argue against the disclosure of fair values in company accounts?Bankers, who are seething over plans to change the way they account forfinancial instruments such as derivatives and loans to customers. The planshave been drawn up by the Joint Working Group, a body made up mainly ofaccounting standard-setters from the world's biggest economies. Bankers saythe results would lead to dramatic swings in the value of balance sheetassets that would often be meaningless and potentially damaging.It is certainly the case that the existing accounting rules often fail toreflect the impact of changes in interest rates or credit risks on bankearnings. Fair value accounting would force banks to adjust their accountsin the light of rises and falls in the values of all financial instruments.The result would be greater volatility in profits but proponents of thechange say it would give investors a truer picture of corporate health.Not so, say the banks. While fair value accounting is appropriate fortrading activities, it would not reflect the real business of makinglong-term loans to customers, which are largely held to maturity andtherefore rarely traded. Banks manage loan portfolios to make a stableinterest margin over the terms of the loans - not on the profits determinedeach year in relation to the interest rate at the time.\n",

      "4229 2685 \"It is basic accounting that you don't record equity until you get cash, and a note doesn't count as cash,\" says Lynn Turner, a former chief accountant for the SEC. \"The question that raises is: How did both partners and the manager on this audit miss this simple Accounting 101 rule?\" Adds Douglas Carmichael, an accounting professor at Baruch College in New York: \"Anyone that's an accountant looking at the entry should have known\" it violated GAAP. An Enron spokesman, Vance Meyer, says, \"The accounting error was just that -- an error,\" explaining that, \"We believed it was not material. However, it was, of course, corrected . . . And we did make the correction with Andersen's concurrence.\" He says Andersen \"performed limited quarterly reviews\" of the company's unaudited financial statements and reviewed the entries that resulted in the shareholder-equity overstatements \"to the extent they deemed necessary.\" To some who follow the accounting world closely, this has a familiar ring to it. During the past few years, every Big Five auditor has been hit by multiple accounting debacles at high-profile clients. For Andersen, Enron joins a list including Waste Management Inc. and Sunbeam Corp. While the names of the clients may change, the issues remain largely the same. For instance, Enron had reported net income of $105 million for 1997, a figure that Enron last week said will be reduced to $9 million in its upcoming restatement for that year. Enron said the reduction is mostly because of $51 million in various unexplained \"audit adjustments and reclassifications\" that its auditors had proposed in 1997 but at the time had determined to be \"immaterial.\" Cumulatively, those immaterial adjustments added up to nearly half of Enron's net income for 1997 and now will be included in the company's restatements. That looks a lot like what happened at Sunbeam. According to the SEC's May settlement order with Sunbeam, Andersen auditors had routinely dismissed so many violations of GAAP as immaterial that they eventually piled up to produce significant distortions in Sunbeam's financial statements, making the barely solvent consumer-products maker look handsomely profitable. Sunbeam filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court protection this past February. In May, the SEC filed a civil lawsuit against five former Sunbeam executives and the Andersen partner in charge of the company's audit, accusing them of engaging in a massive financial fraud; all six defendants have denied the SEC's allegations. Andersen itself wasn't named as a defendant and has said it believes the lawsuit against its partner was an unjustified action over questions of professional judgment.\n",

If a few analysts thought there might be something fishy about what they called  \\\"subjective accounting,\\\" investors didn't particularly care as long as the profits rolled in. As the market fluctuated and the landscape changed, the company might abandon a project that had been in the works for months because its profit margins weren't going to be high enough.  \\\"Enron is known for leaving people at the altar,\\\" says one former employee. Winning the highest possible profits for the company could even extend to Enron's attitude toward charity. When a fundraiser for the Houston READ Commission, a literacy group, called on Enron for a contribution, it was suggested that he start raising money for Enron's competing literacy charity:  \\\"Even the person who was supposed to give money away for Enron was supposed to make money for Enron,\\\" he says.As Enron became more and more successful, the culture Skilling had created took on a dark side: The competition turned inward. As one member of the Enron family put it,  \\\"It became a company full of mercenaries.\\\" The change started at the bottom. As Enron's domination of the energy market grew, most of the recruiting frills fell away. New associates were treated much like the commodities the company traded. Global Change's Enron spies reported overhearing orders like  \\\"I need a smart person-go buy me one\\\" or  \\\"Buy me an intelligent slave, quick.\\\" Enron had never been the kind of place where people sang to you on your birthday, but now the workaholism bordered on self-parody: A Random Acts of Kindness program lasted only a few months. It was too disruptive. People couldn't get their work done.And, of course, Enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension=. The Performance Review Committee, which had initially been installed by Skilling in the Capital group, became known as the harshest forced ranking system in the country. Employees were rated on a scale of one to five, and those with fives were usually gone within six months. (The PRC's nickname quickly became  \\\"rank and yank.\\\" It was a point of pride that Skilling's division had the highest turnover rate in the industry.\"},{\"reason\":\"The email describes Enron's accounting practices as subjective and potentially fishy, but does not explicitly state that it is fraudulent or hiding losses. However, it does highlight the company's aggressive pursuit of profits and its willingness to abandon projects if they don't meet certain profit margins.\",\"Score\":5}\n",

Its apologists, however, would have a stronger case if so many pro forma statements weren't such an obvious attempt to cheerlead or to obscure the audited numbers. During the height of the tech bubble, companies routinely wrote gains generated by minority investments into their pro-forma profits. But now that the value of these investments has crashed, they're disregarded as \"exceptionals.\" The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), which sets U.S. accounting rules, is taking an urgent look at the implications of the Enron case. And the International Accounting Standards Board is in the midst of a two-year review that's trying to rationalize international standards. Good luck to them both.

      "{\"email_text\":\"Companies and investors have argued that accounting standards don't capture the truth of a company's performance, that underlying performance is hidden by the noise of special factors, and that things like goodwill accounting make a nonsense of the balance sheet. Its apologists, however, would have a stronger case if so many pro forma statements weren't such an obvious attempt to cheerlead or to obscure the audited numbers. During the height of the tech bubble, companies routinely wrote gains generated by minority investments into their pro-forma profits. But now that the value of these investments has crashed, they're disregarded as \"exceptionals.\" The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), which sets U.S. accounting rules, is taking an urgent look at the implications of the Enron case. And the International Accounting Standards Board is in the midst of a two-year review that's trying to rationalize international standards. Good luck to them both.

Enron's main technique to pump up earnings probably revolvedaround a loose-as-a-goose process for the accounting of energy derivatives.Called mark-to-market, the technique involves evaluating contracts at \"fairvalue\" prices. Since some of these contracts stretched out for 20 years, thefutures market provides no firm prices. And, absent a liquid market withclear prices, \"fair value\" becomes a mug's game in which companies canvastly inflate value. These overstated gains, of course, were also unrealized, noncash gains. InSeptember 2000, Jonathan Weil, a reporter for the Journal, took a look atEnron's second quarter and found that absent noncash earnings, Enron wouldhave had a loss.

Under its constitution, IASB must consultwith its advisory council--which is yet to be named--before it can formallyfix an agenda. A meeting with the advisory panel is expected to take placein July. The improvements project is an omnibus effort intended to mend avariety of rules IASB inherited from its predecessor board, theInternational Accounting Standards Committee, and to rid those standards ofinconsistencies and inappropriate choices in accounting methods.The transition, or first-time application, project is being watched closelyby the Big 5 accounting firms and their European client-companies.

      "4377 2833 The significance of special charges -- whether they represent old baggage from the past or illuminate the future -- is at the center of a lively debate under way in the accounting world. One side holds that generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, provide the best available snapshot of a company's financial position. GAAP, which companies must use in their official financial statements, requires that nearly all charges be treated as ordinary expenses. Others, including many stock analysts, contend the best view comes from \"pro forma\" financial results -- calculated \"as if\" many expenses didn't really exist. The idea is that these expenses aren't relevant to future performance. Companies increasingly highlight the pro forma view in news releases they generally put out before their official filings with regulators. But pro forma calculations adhere to no particular standard. Companies essentially do what they want. Now, accountants and economists say the practice of excluding blemishes is so widespread that companies and analysts often guide investors to dismiss charges that contain prescient warnings -- like the one at Bethlehem Steel. Ms. Applebaum, the Salomon Smith Barney analyst who played down Bethlehem's big write-off, explains that she has covered other steel companies that returned to profitability shortly after writing off deferred tax assets. She thought Bethlehem would do the same. She notes that GAAP rules on such assets obliged Bethlehem to follow strict criteria in assessing its chances of future profitability -- stricter criteria than stock analysts typically use. As for Bethlehem, Chief Financial Officer Leonard M. Anthony says the charge the company took was to some extent \"predictive of the future.\" GAAP also has well-established standards for writing down other kinds of assets. Companies must reduce the value on their books of anything from a customer loan to a manufacturing plant when its worth has diminished. Again, Wall Street stock analysts tend to dismiss the resulting charges as one-time events. Sometimes that makes sense. During the 1981-82 recession, restructuring was a part of many corporations' strategies. They took charges for streamlining, outsourcing and otherwise shedding costs to position themselves for recovery. Because the resulting earnings volatility made it hard to compare companies' growth rates or price-earnings ratios, and because the charges weren't expected to recur, there was logic to excluding them to come up with \"smoothed\" earnings trends. \"Investors came to look upon the charges, correctly in many cases, as evidence that those firms had recognized past mistakes and had made tough decisions to become more efficient,\" said a September 2001 study by the Jerome Levy Economics Institute at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y.\n",

Whatever happened afterthe draft and invitation to comment were issued in the run-up to Christmas,``Australia will have to make a choice.''Accounting bodies worldwide have been working on standards for financialinstruments to prevent the derivatives -related disasters that rocked manycompanies during the late 1980s and early 1990s, including US companyProcter & Gamble, which lost $US157 million on interest-rate derivatives in1994.The matter has become urgent in Australia partly because the United Stateshas introduced its own standard Financial Accounting Standard Boardstatement No133 which became effective for some companies on July 1, andwhich will operate from January 1 for those whose financial years coincidewith the calendar.FAS 133 is regarded as a nightmare by corporate treasurers in the US andhere, because it requires derivatives and other financial instruments to be``marked to market'' every quarter, rather than accounted for on afair-value basis.Its critics claim it will lead to volatility and confusion in companyfinancial statements.Mr Alfredson said that in the US, ``there is now a special interpretationgroup like the Urgent Issues Group here interpreting 133. In other words, itis so complex, readers can't just read the standard and interpret it. Thegroup has already issued more than 100 interpretations.''Australia has no accounting standard that deals comprehensively with therecognition and measurement of financial instruments, although it has madeprogress with disclosure requirements. Acknowledging the concern over themark-to-market approach, the AASB commissioned the development of afair-value model.The joint working group consists of representatives from Australia, Canada,France, Germany, New Zealand, the Nordic countries, Britain, the US and theInternational Accounting Standards Committee. IASC has incorporated elementsof FAS 133 into its own much-criticised financial instruments standard, IAS39.It remains to be seen how much simpler the fair-value approach will be.``In fair-value accounting, you get the market value for the instruments atthe time and fair value them. It sounds easy in principle, but it is muchmore complicated in practice,'' Mr Alfredson said.Developing the appropriate standard is only half the battle, however; thetrick is to gain widespread acceptance for it. Even if Australia acceptedthe fair-value model, Mr Alfredson said, it would not be able to implementit alone, ``at least if I have any influence''.\n",

The matter has become urgent in Australia partly because the United States has introduced its own standard Financial Accounting Standard Board statement No133 which became effective for some companies on July 1, and which will operate from January 1 for those whose financial years coincide with the calendar. FAS 133 is regarded as a nightmare by corporate treasurers in the US and here, because it requires derivatives and other financial instruments to be ``marked to market'' every quarter, rather than accounted for on a fair-value basis. Its critics claim it will lead to volatility and confusion in company financial statements. Mr Alfredson said that in the US, ``there is now a special interpretation group like the Urgent Issues Group here interpreting 133. In other words, it is so complex, readers can't just read the standard and interpret it. The group has already issued more than 100 interpretations.'' Australia has no accounting standard that deals comprehensively with the recognition and measurement of financial instruments, although it has made progress with disclosure requirements. Acknowledging the concern over the mark-to-market approach, the AASB commissioned the development of a fair-value model. The joint working group consists of representatives from Australia, Canada, France, Germany, New Zealand, the Nordic countries, Britain, the US and the International Accounting Standards Committee. IASC has incorporated elements of FAS 133 into its own much-criticised financial instruments standard, IAS39. It remains to be seen how much simpler the fair-value approach will be. ``In fair-value accounting, you get the market value for the instruments at the time and fair value them. It sounds easy in principle, but it is much more complicated in practice,'' Mr Alfredson said. Developing the appropriate standard is only half the battle, however; the trick is to gain widespread acceptance for it. Even if Australia accepted the fair-value model, Mr Alfredson said, it would not be able to implement it alone, ``at least if I have any influence''.\"}, \n",

Every three years since 1978, major accounting firms, under the oversight of the Public Oversight Board (POB), have been engaged to conduct reviews of the accounting and auditing practices of member firms in the AICPA SEC Practice Section (SECPS).

They are willing to support the MD index product in its current hourly-pricing design. So, we can continue to assume a pass-through of hourly PJM BGE prices and all associated ancillaries, losses, and other uplifts (with physical delivery 7/1/02), with the only fixed component being deal costs (including a scheduling fee) and margin.One issue that came up is how much of the hourly PJM data is already being tracked...so duplication of systems can be prevented. Do you know of any particular PJM databases that already exist, that would be used to develop the PJM BGE index?The draft Product Approval Template (copy attached) is still on target, so please let me know if you have any changes. If not, we will soon broaden the reviewers and see if we can get approval signatures. Thanks!Bob\n",

But we can't stop at Arthur Andersen. The real \"values\" crisis represented by the Enron mess is far deeper, and stretches across our economy. We are all being victimized by it, and the situation is growing ever worse. It is the great unreported business story of our time: the growing failure of the accounting system to accurately capture what is going in the new hyperspeed economy. Simply put, we have no idea what any company is worth today. The accounting industry is mired in a system that was devised 600 years ago and has only been fine-tuned ever since. It doesn't work any more. Accountants know it, corporate executives know it, and the stock market knows it. The general recognition of this fact has led to a widespread ethical sloppiness made manifest in such things as Arthur Andersen's apparent conflict. The reality is that the only time anybody really checks an audit anymore is after a financial disaster like Enron, when scapegoats must be found. Rear-View Mirror Accounting I once likened traditional accounting to driving a car by only looking in the rear view mirror. It can tell you where a company has recently been, but it is unable to tell you where that company is now. And in a world in which change occurs in nanoseconds, such obsolete data is worthless. Today, events arrive so swiftly, and change so constant, that it is no longer even enough to operate in the present. Modern business now runs in the future. The result is a growing gap between traditional \"book\" value and actual market value - and through that gap drives not only companies like Enron, but truly valuable firms like General Electric and Intel. Traditional accounting has long dealt with that gap through a line entry entitled \"goodwill.\" But it was typically only added when a company sold for more than the total value of its inventory, buildings, etc. At most, this goodwill only represented a few percent of the total value. That was then. In the modern economy, for great, fast moving, innovative young companies this so-called \"goodwill\" can represent 90 percent of their value. When a corporate audit can only tell us about ten percent of a company, what the hell is the point? There have been a number of efforts in recent years to come up with innovative new ways to determine corporate value, many of them under the all-encompassing terms \"intellectual capital\" or \"intangible assets\".

Led by the Big 5 firms--Arthur Andersen, KPMG, Deloitte & Touche, PricewaterhouseCoopers and Ernst & Young--the profession for years has argued it can police itself. It has now proved that it can't. Stricter oversight is necessary. It's time to put the \"public\" interest back into accounting. There must be real consequences for firms that fail in that duty. Former Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt saw the conflict of interest problem looming ever larger and sought to sharply restrict the amount of consulting business accounting firms could perform for their audit clients. He lost. But he succeeded in forcing disclosure of how much companies were paying in fees for consulting and auditing services. That helps identify the scope of the problem. SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt proposed that accounting firms be policed by a private oversight board that would operate under the auspices of the SEC. That's a good idea, but to make it effective Pitt should push for tighter financial reporting and more disclosure to investors. The SEC can reduce the ambiguities.

The equity culture that has generated so much growth over the year=s depends on a clear answer, but getting one has become impossible. Enron C=orp. just announced that its earnings for the past three years were oversta=ted by half a billion dollars. How did one of the biggest companies on the =New York Stock Exchange manage to inflate its earnings by 20% without audit=ors, analysts, ratings agencies, and the business press (BusinessWeek inclu=ded) discovering it? In part, blame the breakdown of standardized accountin=g rules and the anarchy that runs rampant in the financial statements of Co=rporate America. The U.S. needs a new set of accounting rules that gives a =clear picture of financial performance. Without integrity in financial repo=rting, the U.S. cannot hope to remain the preeminent place to invest in the= global marketplace (page 76).=20The dot-com bubble was the first indication that there was something seriou=sly wrong with accounting standards. Companies without much of a business m=odel customized their quarterly statements to exclude a grab bag of expense=s in order to put a positive financial spin on their operations.

Soon, the meth=od of calculating earnings began to vary from company to company and even f=rom quarter to quarter within a company. It is now chaos.A stricter adherence to accounting rules won't solve the entire problem. GA=AP, the generally accepted accounting principles, allow all kinds of one-ti=me expenses and noncash charges. This obscures the performance of ongoing o=perations. No one can fathom what are true operating earnings because there= are no guidelines as to what constitutes an extraordinary expense. The res=ult is total confusion. Take earnings per share for the Standard & Poor's 5=00-stock index for the second quarter. Under Thomson Financial/First Call s=tandards, it is $11.82. But it's $9.02 according to S&P and $4.83 under GAA=P.

      "4303 2759 LONDON -(Dow Jones)- Issues bedeviling the accounting profession for years have finally flashed into the headlines, thanks to Enron and the bursting of the Internet bubble.Unhappily, most are unlikely to be solved anytime soon. Questions of auditor independence and the use of pro forma statements are at the fore. Not far behind are ones on accounting for options and goodwill. And then there's the issue of which standards to use. Right now, \"who guards the guardians\" has leapfrogged to the top of the agenda. The Enron collapse shows that auditors need to be more independent. It's a thinly-disguised fiction that auditors are paid by and act on behalf of shareholders. Clearly, it's corporate management doing the hiring and firing of auditors. And audit itself makes little profit. Instead, accountants rely on consulting and more technical or specialized practices, like M&A, to generate fees. An accountant refusing to pass a company's results runs the risk of losing a big part of his own business. Even the risk of litigation isn't - or at least hasn't been pre-Enron - enough of a deterrent. What's the solution? Make sure companies that audit aren't swayed by conflicts of interest. Regulators should either encourage stand-alone audit firms or prohibit auditors from any other involvement with the companies they scrutinize - even if that's tricky for big international corporations, which can use all of the \"big five\" accounting firms in the course of a year's global dealings. Another dilemma is the issue of pro formas. There's a mounting consensus that pro forma statements are suspect. According to some estimates, pro forma results for S&P 500 companies during the third quarter overstated audited profits by 70%. Why should companies push their pro formas when, after all, there's a perfectly good U.S. audited accounting standard: the U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)?

      "{\"email_text\":\" LONDON  -(Dow Jones)- Issues bedeviling the accounting profession for years have finally flashed into the headlines, thanks to Enron and the bursting of the Internet bubble.Unhappily, most are unlikely to be solved anytime soon. Questions of auditor independence and the use of pro forma statements are at the fore. Not far behind are ones on accounting for options and goodwill. And then there' s the issue of which standards to use. Right now,  \"who guards the guardians\" has leapfrogged to the top of the agenda. The Enron collapse shows that auditors need to be more independent. It' s a thinly- disguised fiction that auditors are paid by and act on behalf of shareholders. Clearly, it' s corporate management doing the hiring and firing of auditors. And audit itself makes little profit. Instead, accountants rely on consulting and more technical or specialized practices, like M& A, to generate fees. An accountant refusing to pass a company' s results runs the risk of losing a big part of his own business. Even the risk of litigation isn' t - or at least hasn' t been pre-Enron - enough of a deterrent. What' s the solution? Make sure companies that audit aren' t swayed by conflicts of interest. Regulators should either encourage stand-alone audit firms or prohibit auditors from any other involvement with the companies they scrutinize  - even if that' s tricky for big international corporations, which can use all of the  \"big five\" accounting firms in the course of a year' s global dealings. Another dilemma is the issue of pro formas. There' s a mounting consensus that pro forma statements are suspect. According to some estimates, pro forma results for S& P 500 companies during the third quarter overstated audited profits by 70%. Why should companies push their pro formas when, after all, there' s a perfectly good U.S. audited accounting standard: the U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)? Enron notwithstanding, surveys show investors are more confident with U.S. corporate results than those from Europe or Japan. And yet, U.S. GAAP has its own problems. U.S. accounting is rigidly based on rules, unlike elsewhere, where it' s more a case of applying broad principles. Though these rules are designed to ensure standards, they' re often subverted by loopholes. U.S. companies can comply with the letter of the law but still offer a distorted picture of fundamentals.

Using so-called gain-on-sale accounting (a form of mark-to-market accounting), those lenders booked earnings from loans as soon as they were made, rather than having to wait for them to be paid off, as banks typically do.   But as interest rates fell in 1998, many customers paid off their loans earlier than expected, slashing lenders' profit margins. Compounding matters, the market for mortgage-backed securities dried up in the wake of financial chaos in Russia and other foreign markets, leaving lenders to bear the higher risks of many new loans.

After the crash, subprime lenders routinely began disclosing the key assumptions used to value their mortgage portfolios.

Current rules havefostered a ``technical, legalistic mindset that is sometimes moreconcerned with form than with substance,'' Berardino said. Enron, whose auditor was Arthur Andersen, filed forbankruptcy protection after posting a third-quarter loss of $1.01billion in October. The Houston-based company used off-balance-sheet financing vehicles that enabled it to boost leverage withoutreporting to investors the increased debt on its balance sheet. The U.S. financial reporting model, which emphasizeshistorical information and a single earnings-per-share number, wascreated in the 1930s, when most assets were tangible and therewere no derivatives or off-balance-sheet financing. It needs to beupdated to take into account new complex financial structures andthe associated risks, Berardino said. Today, disclosures should becontinuous, not periodic, and include performance indicatorsbeyond earnings-per-share, Berardino said. Berardino also said that it takes too long to set newstandards because regulatory responsibilities are shared by toomany agencies. ``Responsibility for administering discipline istoo diffuse and punishment is not sufficiently certain to promoteconfidence in the profession,'' Berardino wrote.EDF Says It's in Talks to Buy Enron's European Retail Unit2001-12-04 09:01 (New York)EDF Says It's in Talks to Buy Enron's European Retail Unit Paris, Dec. 4 (Bloomberg) -- Electricite de France, Europe'slargest power company, said it is in negotiations to buy theEuropean retail energy business of Enron Corp., the U.S. energytrader that filed for bankruptcy protection. France's state-owned electricity company would gain 150,000gas and electricity customers, mainly in the U.K., with theacquisition of Enron Direct. It is talking toPricewaterhouseCoopers about a purchase, said a spokesman forElectricite de France, who declined to be named. ``Enron Direct would fit well with our London Electricitybusiness,'' Gerard Wolf, director of the chairman's office for theFrench company, told Reuters earlier. Enron, the biggest energy trader, is trying to survivehistory's biggest Chapter 11 reorganization. It's lining up a $1.5billion loan, getting permission to spend money to keep operatingand firing 4,000 workers. Centrica Plc and Innogy Holdings Plc of the U.K, TXU Corp.and RWE AG, Germany's No. 2 utility, are also interested in buyingEnron Direct, said Reuters, without citing a source.--Brooke Nelson in the Madrid newsroom (34 91) 700-9602, orEnron Lines Up $1.5 Billion in Bankruptcy Financing (Update5)2001-12-03 21:02 (New York)Enron Lines Up $1.5 Billion in Bankruptcy Financing (Update5)\n",

Paul Wallace a manager in the co-ordination function is working extensively on developing the controls in this area. I would suggest that you contact Paul directly if you wish to discuss specific areas or inventory controls in general.3. Funding of inventoryWe have a structured finance facility here in London. The deal is specific to Enron Metals markets in that it works by reference to LME prices as these are the base index for all the positions placed in the facility. If structured financing is sort for EIM then it would be appropriate to talk to either David Tregar (Metals Commercial) or Bill Appleby (Global Finance) as an intro to the issues faced.4. Curve Management ProcessThe markets in which our merchanting division trades are based on the LME curves but are linked to a large number of basis curves for quality and location. Given the vast number we have opted to break down the markets by brand group and port location. E.G. for Copper this means we have a grid with 5 brand groups and 3 sets of port groups (13 for europe, 7 for the US and 6 for the Far East). The maintaince & price testing of the grids is made manageable by the fact the premiums only need be entered for brand and port groups by the traders yet prices can be tested by reference to node points i.e. price of specific brand at a given location which can be checked to a market quote.5.

The maintaince & price testing of the grids is made manageable by the fact the premiums only need be entered for brand and port groups by the traders yet prices can be tested by reference to node points i.e. price of specific brand at a given location which can be checked to a market quote.\\r\\n5.

I think the diagnostic measure should be, for each commodity DPR a report daily of all those signed off as final (note I do not neccessarily mean \"officialized\") after the relevant market opening time (usuaully 7.30 am)Timely confirmation and execution of transactions (completeness, accuracy, existence)Monthly report of all unmatched confirmations:- outstanding inward confirmations (i.e. sent out, not signed) - outstanding outward confirmations (i.e deal done, confirm not sent) - outstanding mismatched or disputed confirmationsshowing deal trade date, start date, commodity, counterparty, MTM value, agedSettlements with counterparties occurs accurately and timely (non CACS, non Dashed deals)Monthly report of cumulative amounts of all unmatched or unapplied cash:Unapplied cash by counterparty, in original denomination, including deal reference if anyUnmatched amounts by deal, where settled amount differs from maturing forward MTM valueOne additional thing that ocurred to me was the fact that those responsible for supplying the information are also those responsible for the operation underlying it in some sense, so the obvious pitfalls of self - assessment will come into play here.

With accounting irregularities getting much of the blame in Enron's fall, Democratic Sens. Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut and Jon Corzine of New Jersey propose to restrict accounting firms from offering other services to their audit clients. Their bill has the support of Senate Majority Leader Thomas Daschle of South Dakota; it would prohibit accounting firms from auditing companies whose executives recently worked for the auditor. Just over a year ago, the accounting industry successfully fought off a similar conflict-of-interest ban that former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt advocated. The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants opposes the new measure, and argues that no evidence suggests that a ban on such relationships would have made a difference in the Enron case. AICPA President Barry Melancon says he backs new SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt's plan to overhaul the existing system of industry self-regulation, to create an independent oversight panel. Mr. Pitt, who represented big accounting firms as a private attorney before his SEC appointment by President Bush, says he is developing an industry-funded response to the accounting problems, rather than beefing up the SEC staff and budget to directly regulate the accounting industry. Although the chairman has said he would work with Congress if a consensus develops for some accounting legislation, he noted that the SEC could approve new disclosure rules and oversee the new private-regulatory body more quickly than Congress would get new legislation to Mr. Bush's desk. The Enron investigation also has revived the debate about whether complicated derivatives investments should be regulated. In late 2000, Congress exempted from nearly any regulation these over-the-counter derivatives, which are contracts whose value is derived from the underlying assets such as commodities or currencies.

      "4520 2976 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- There may one good thing that comes out of the Enron Corp. (ENE) financial mess - stricter accounting rules governing consolidation of financial results.Enron acknowledged earlier Thursday that it incorrectly accounted for its relationships with related partnerships by keeping them off its financial statements. It corrected that mistake by consolidating the partnerhips into its results, a move that led Enron to restate three years worth of earnings, lowering them by a collective $586 million. Under current accounting regulations, companies don't have to consolidate loss or income from entities in which they have an interest below 51%, keeping those losses or gains off their books (the balance sheets and income statements). The Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, has been working on a project that would replace the standard of ownership by a more encompassing one of control. But that project has been languishing since 1982 when the board first started considering the issue. \"This is an area where FASB is struggling\" to set new criteria, said Alan Bromberg, a professor of corporate and securities law at the Dedeman School of Law of The Southern Methodist University. FASB has struggled in part because companies were fighting the changes and it has had difficulty in defining control to mean something other than majority ownership. The Enron's restatement and consolidation is also focusing attention on another arcane accounting rule, one dealing with minimum ownership by unaffiliated outsiders. Under a statement made by the Securities and Exchange Commission during an Emerging Issue Task Force meeting over a decade ago, the SEC stated that a minimum outside investment was needed for the special purpose entity to qualify for non consolidation. This guideline has remained in effect ever since. According to EITF documents dated 1989 and 1990, a minimum outside investment of 3% or more in a special purpose entity may be necessary, depending on the credit risk, for it to qualify for non-consolidation status. Given that some of the special entities created by Enron were controlled by some of its former executives, experts said it's possible that the SEC was considering the outside ownership of these entities insufficient for them to qualify for non consolidation. Meanwhile, it's unclear how Arthur Andersen LLP, Enron's independent auditor since the late 1980s, will be affected by the company's restatement and recent financial turmoil. A spokesman for Arthur Andersen said his firm \"continues to cooperate with Enron and its special committee to bring a resolution to this matter.\" The accounting giant has had some recent run-ins with shareholders and regulators because of accounting issues. It recently agreed to pay $110 million to settle a shareholder lawsuit over audits it conducted for Sunbeam Corp. Sunbeam had been accused of overstating its revenues and subsequently went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\n",

      "4039 2495 The BBA has joined other banks across Europe in condemning a plan unveiledlate last year by the Joint Working Group, a body made up mainly ofaccounting standard-setters from the world's biggest economies. Theproposals, which are being considered by national standard-setting bodiesand the European Commission, will make companies adjust earnings to takeaccount of rises and falls in the values of financial instruments such asderivatives and loans to customers.The BBA conference includes contributions from the chief accountants ofHSBC, BNP Paribas and Barclays Bank, none of whom is expected to speakfavourably about the proposals.The banks say it is unfair to make them account for changes in the values ofinstruments such as long-term customer loans, which are rarely traded andgenerally held to maturity. They are worried that sharp changes in interestrates would lead to dramatic changes in banks' accounts and confuseconsumers.Banks argue the swings could put them at risk of breaching solvencyrequirements set by regulators, forcing them to withdraw from lending thatcaused volatility even though it was safe.The standard-setters who produced the plan say it should help investors byrevealing large liabilities that remain concealed under traditionalaccounting rules.Prospects for Quick Resolution of Japan'sBad Loan Problem Dim; Study Panel UrgedBNA - May 24, 2001By Toshio AritakeTOKYO--With barely a month left before the Diet (parliament) adjourns inlate June, Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's international pledgeto settle the bad loan problem of banks in two years appears to havestalled.Minister in Charge of Financial Services Hakuo Yanagisawa May 17 met TakashiImai, chairman of the powerful Keidanren (the Federation of EconomicOrganizations of Japan) that represents all top Japanese companies.Yanagisawa asked for Keidanren cooperation and proposed the establishment ofa joint study panel of Keidanren and Zenginkyo (the Federation of BankersAssociations of Japan) to examine early bad loan disposal, a FinancialServices Agency official said May 21. But Imai demurred, only agreeing tothe need for prompt action, Keidanren officials said May 21.However, Keidanren and Zenginkyo May 22 began exploring ways to form theproposed study panel. The two organizations are preparing to hold atop-level meeting during the week of May 27 and will try to work out a jointguideline on debt forgiveness by banks to borrowers by the end of June, aKeidanren official said May 23.\n",

The topic of intangibles was thesubject of extended debate among FASB's seven members as they weighed itsimportance in allocating staff resources to such a project or to two otherissues vying for the attention of rulemakers. FASB heard arguments from one board member, John Wulff, suggesting that aneffort to simplify and codify standards and other guidance that formstatements of generally accepted principles, together with writing standardson revenue recognition and defining liability, may be more suitablecandidates for rulemaking. Major U.S. corporations, through at least onetrade group, the Institute of Management Accountants, counseled the coursedescribed by Wulff, a former leader of Financial Executive International'sCommittee on Corporate Reporting. That committee opposes FASB's taking onthe performance reporting and intangibles projects as outlined in aprospectus issued about two months ago. FASB settled on a compromise plan offered by board Chairman Edmund Jenkins.In the compromise, the panel's staff will carry out further preparatory workon intangible assets. At the same time, FASB's staff will study the threepotential projects--revenue recognition and liability definition,simplification and codification of accounting rules, and disclosures aboutintangibles--with an eye toward deciding an appropriate use of staffaccountants' time. The additional work on intangibles is to focus onsummarizing existing research on such non-concrete assets as in-processresearch and development, patents, and customer lists, with particular focuson questions about what information on intangibles is useful to investors,security analysts, and other users of financial statements. FASB would notcarry out polling or surveys, the board emphasized. The board tentativelyset a deadline of Dec. 24 for completion of the two-pronged work by itsstaff. That timetable would suggest FASB plans to make a more definitivedecision on adding a second, or even a third, standard-setting project inearly 2002.\n",

The letter was signed by heads of the US,European and Japanese banking associations.\"We are keen to implement the new accord in 2004, but we see no absolutereason why the end-of-the-year timetable has to be kept,\" said MaurizioSella, president of the European Banking Federation. \"It's much better toget out a proposal that's right even if it is a few months' late.\"The committee published its latest draft of the proposed Basle 2 accord inJanuary and set a deadline for consultation with the industry to becompleted by the end of May. But many financial operators believe this isnow unrealistic.The banking associations are asking for detailed papers to be sent to themby August so that they could respond by October.\"The Basle committee has bitten off more than it can chew,\" said IanLinnell, banking analyst at credit rating agency Fitch. \"The accord in itsdraft form is incredibly aggressive and a contains a number of black holesthat require further work.\"Banks want detailed papers on the treatment of retail, equity and projectfinance portfolios. They are also asking for more information on the wayoperational risk - unexpected losses - will be treated, and for details onaspects of securitisation, counterparty risk and disclosure.The letter points out that in a number of important areas the Baslecommittee's second consultation document has either come up with newproposals or indicated that final proposals are to come.\"Taken together these greener areas will have a critical impact on theoutcome of the proposals for individual firms and the industry as a whole,\"the letter says.The banks are particularly concerned about the levels of capital that wouldhave to be carried by some institutions to cover operational risk.\n",

      "4297 2753 01/03/2002Chicago TribuneNorth Sports Final ; N3(Copyright 2002 by the Chicago Tribune)Accounting firm Andersen said Wednesday that its auditing practice responsible for checking the books of bankrupt energy trader Enron Corp. has been given a clean bill of health in a peer review by another accounting firm, but some observers criticized the findings. The review, performed by rival Big Five firm Deloitte & Touche, was part of an assessment carried out once every three years to check the quality of financial reporting of top firms.Andersen's accounting systems were \"deemed to provide reasonable assurance of compliance with professional standards,\" according to a statement from the Chicago-based firm. \"Deloitte's opinion was unmodified, without qualification,\" for the year ended Aug. 31, Andersen added. But the integrity of the process was criticized almost immediately by analysts, including professor Lynn Turner, a former Securities and Exchange Commission chief accountant and current director of the Center for Quality Financial Reporting at Colorado State University. \"If the process was really credible, I don't think we'd be having the rash of problems we are having today,\" Turner said. Turner cited reporting problems that have cost investors billions of dollars at Enron, such other Andersen clients as Waste Management Inc. and Sunbeam Corp., and similar high-profile failures at Cendant Corp., Rite Aid Corp. and MicroStrategy Inc. after audits by other accounting firms. Critics of the peer review process point to the fact that since the cooperative assessments began in 1978, no Big Five accounting firm has received a qualified opinion of its accounting procedures from a rival. When Enron filed for bankruptcy protection in December, it was Andersen's Houston office's largest client. The energy trader's collapse is the subject of a SEC investigation, lawsuits and a number of congressional probes. According to Deloitte's letter of comment, which accompanied the unqualified opinion, Andersen was told about a need to improve minor documentation and communication problems. Andersen's peer review was all but complete when it asked in November for the review to be expanded to include the Houston office responsible for auditing Enron, which had disclosed financial reporting problems that led to $1.2 billion being chopped from shareholders' equity. The assessment did not look specifically at the audit Andersen performed on Enron, because there is \"pending litigation\" over reporting problems, according to Deloitte's letter.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Rosenthal said a current Tax Courtcase involves the Internal Revenue Service disputing a company's use of a\"credit adjustment\" to reduce income.Price said the rules allow companies to elect to use \"hedgeaccounting.\" He said a company which recognized gain or loss from aderivative identified as a hedge could have an offsetting gain or loss fromthe item being hedged. Thus, hedge accounting reduces the volatility createdby FAS 133 for companies that hedge their risk. However, FAS 133 contains astrict definition for a hedge, and an item could lose its character as ahedge because the definition is reapplied every quarter to the same item.The panelists noted that for tax purposes, once an item is considered ahedge, its character would not change subsequently.Price said the new FASB rule applies to entities that reportto the Securities Exchange Commission and are effective for fiscal yearsbeginning after June 15, 2000, and Jan. 1, 2001, for companies reporting ona calendar year.Ops Execs See Raised ProfileOperations Management - November 27, 2000Operations and technology executives are taking on a larger role withinfirms and ate receiving more senior job titles as a result, according to aRussell Reynolds Associates study to be released this week. \"The head ofoperations is no longer just a senior v.p., but is now at the partnerlevel,\" said George Wilbanks, partner with Russell Reynolds.The shift has been prompted by a number of factors, including the blurringof lines between banks, insurers,mutual fund firms and other financial services companies, and the growingimportance of multiple channels and the subsequent complexity of operationsand information. \"Firms need much more robust technology and operationsplatforms to handle the added complexity,\" Wilbanks said. The study - 2000Recruiting Trends in Investment Management\" - also found an increase in thenumber of searches in operations, because many firms do not have someone inplace who can take on a more executive role.U.K Association Sets Up Think TankOperations Management - November 27, 2000.The Computing Services and Software Association, the U.K. trade associationfor the IT services and software sector, is establishing a think tank toinvestigate applied technology in the financial and business sectors.

      "4258 2714 October 2001 - Andersen's concerns mushroom about how Enron will report its third-quarter results, and whether the report will pass muster legally and reflect generally accepted accounting practices. Oct. 9, Andersen hires an outside law firm to advise the firm amid its growing concern about the Enron account, indicating Andersen was becoming concerned about its legal liability. Oct. 12, Temple sends an e-mail to an Andersen executive, who forwarded it to Duncan, in which the Andersen attorney says: \"It might be useful to consider reminding the (Enron) engagement team of our documentation and retention policy. It will be helpful to make sure we have complied with the policy.\" The policy addresses \"organization, retention and destruction\" of client information. Also Oct. 12, Duncan receives a draft press release from Enron in which the company plans to describe its $1 billion charge against income as a nonrecurring item. Three days later, Duncan sends a memo to \"the files\" outlining his Oct. 14 discussion with Enron Chief Accounting Officer Rick Causey. Duncan voiced \"strong concerns\" that describing the charge as nonrecurring \"could be misconstrued or misunderstood by investors.\" Duncan also noted that he informed Causey that Andersen was aware of enforcement actions undertaken by the Securities and Exchange Commission \"in cases where they believe such a presentation was materially misleading.\" Oct. 15, Enron issued a press release describing the charge as nonrecurring. Oct. 16, Temple sends an e-mail to Duncan advising him to delete her name from the memo about Andersen's concerns about Enron's handling of the third-quarter press release. \"Reference to the legal group consultation arguably is a waiver of attorney-client privileged advice and if my name is mentioned it increases the chances that I might be a witness, which I prefer to avoid.\" Around Oct. 19-20, Duncan learns the SEC has launched a formal inquiry of Enron's financial records and reporting. He informs the Andersen consultation group, which includes Temple. Oct. 22, Duncan and the Andersen auditing team meet with Causey, Enron's chief accounting officer, to discuss the SEC probe. Oct. 23, Duncan convenes an \"urgent meeting\" of the Enron auditing team, at which he organizes a concerted effort to destroy a \"significant\" number of documents of interest to SEC and congressional investigators, Andersen executives testify. Oct. 24, Enron fires Fastow, its chief financial officer. Oct. 25, Enron issues a notice advising that preservation of documents is required by law, given that the company was being sued by investors.

Oct. 16, Temple sends an e-mail to Duncan advising him to delete her name from the memo about Andersen's concerns about Enron's handling of the third-quarter press release. \\\"Reference to the legal group consultation arguably is a waiver of attorney-client privileged advice and if my name is mentioned it increases the chances that I might be a witness, which I prefer to avoid.\\\" Around Oct. 19-20, Duncan learns the SEC has launched a formal inquiry of Enron's financial records and reporting. He informs the Andersen consultation group, which includes Temple. Oct. 22, Duncan and the Andersen auditing team meet with Causey, Enron's chief accounting officer, to discuss the SEC probe. Oct. 23, Duncan convenes an \\\"urgent meeting\\\" of the Enron auditing team, at which he organizes a concerted effort to destroy a \\\"significant\\\" number of documents of interest to SEC and congressional investigators, Andersen executives testify. Oct. 24, Enron fires Fastow, its chief financial officer. Oct. 25, Enron issues a notice advising that preservation of documents is required by law, given that the company was being sued by investors. The Duncan-led document destruction would continue through the first 10 days of November.\\\"\"},\n",

Revised Draft ? Conference Call on Tuesday, January 16th, 2:00 p.m.Based on discussion at our last conference call and follow-up conversationswith some EPSA members, attached is a significantly revised list of GuidingPrinciples on Market Monitoring for FERC's staff technical conference onJanuary 23rd to develop market monitoring procedures for the Cal ISOmarkets. The most significant change from the prior draft is that we nowdelete any reference to specific price levels that would screen prices inCalifornia and focuses instead why a price-based analysis for marketmonitoring is inappropriate, since it fails to account for capacity costs,opportunity costs and scarcity values.FERC Staff has asked that EPSA be prepared to make a presentation at theJanuary 23rd conference, so it is important that we see if there isconsensus on this approach. We will discuss this draft on a conferencecall on Tuesday, January 16th at 2:00 p.m. (EST).

Indeed, as a side note, most of the documents that I have drafted or reviewed always use some form of acronym for subsequent references to Enron. I am indifferent, but I know that the reason our accounting brethen made that comment, as well as the other comments they often make that seem counter-intuitive, is that it facilitates their efforts in ensuring that documents reflect off-balance sheet, soft costs related rather than on-balance sheet, hard costs.

Brushing up on a basic accounting textbook might have helped, some critics say. Confirming investors' fears, the Houston energy trader Thursday filed a lengthy disclosure document with the Securities and Exchange Commission declaring that its financial statements going back to 1997 \"should not be relied upon\" and will have to be restated. Among other problems, Enron acknowledged overstating its net income by a total of $586 million, or 20%. Enron's financial statements long have been widely assailed as indecipherable. Now, it turns out, they were just plain wrong.But what is most striking about the latest disclosures is that they show Enron's misstatements weren't limited merely to judgment calls and gray areas for the green-eyeshade crowd to debate. Portions of Enron's accounting practices amounted to violations of elementary accounting principles, some accounting specialists say. Citing client-confidentiality rules, an Andersen spokesman, David Tabolt, declines to comment on his firm's work for Enron, which on Friday agreed to be bought by crosstown rival Dynegy. He calls Enron's disavowal of its previous financial statements an \"unfortunate situation\" and says Andersen is cooperating with the SEC's Enron investigation and the special committee formed by Enron to investigate the company's accounting and disclosure practices. Consider the primary reason for the $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity that Enron revealed in mid-October, sparking much of the downdraft in the company's shares. At the time, Enron said the reduction came about because it had decided to unwind certain transactions with some limited partnerships with which it had done business. On Thursday, however, Enron acknowledged that the original accounting for the transactions violated generally accepted accounting principles. Starting in early 2000, the company said last week, Enron issued shares of its own common stock to four \"special-purpose entities,\" in exchange for which it received a note receivable. Enron said it had increased both its note-receivable assets and shareholder equity, a move the company called \"an accounting error\" that it is correcting. Under GAAP, the payment a company receives when issuing stock only counts as equity if it is cash. As a result, Enron's 2000 audited financial statements overstated the company's notes-receivable assets and shareholder equity by $172 million. And Enron's 2001 unaudited statements overstated them by $828 million. The $1 billion overstatement represents 8.5% of Enron's previously reported shareholder equity as of June 30.\n",

Enron's wrinkle has long been \"divide and disavow,\" and it seems that, for the bankrupt energy trader and its lawyers, old gambits die hard. One of the principal components of the Enron scandal was the company's practice of creating partnerships and then using them to push its assets or debts off its books. Technically this can be legal, so long as the partnerships are truly separate, which, among other things, means that outside investors control as little as 3% of the partnership equity. The myth of separation--while still strongly believed by Enron itself--is losing support among the accounting firms who have been tainted by Enron and other recent scandals. The Big Five accounting firms are coming around to the idea that providing certain consulting services to the same company it is auditing creates an inherent conflict and is bad business. Until recently, the accounting profession bitterly opposed any limits on its consulting services, beating back rule changes proposed by Arthur Levitt when he was chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. But the Enron taint has spread past Enron's own auditor, Arthur Andersen, and the firms are seeking to police themselves lest others--such as the SEC--do it for them. PricewaterhouseCoopers and KPMG said yesterday said they would support such proposals. Andersen itself is said to be leaning in that direction and that it will soon announce substantial changes in how it does business. The Walt Disney Co. approved of the new regime of separation yesterday when its chairman, Michael Eisner, said the company would not use its independent auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers, for any new consulting work and would evaluate the current projects the accounting firm's consultants are currently doing for the company. Disney in 2000 paid PricewaterhouseCoopers $8.7 million in audit fees and around $32 million in non-audit fees. PricewaterhouseCoopers, for its part, said it intended to spin off its consulting arm in an IPO, which could mollify Disney and others. Arthur Andersen, in 2000, separated from its old consulting arm, now known as Accenture, after a long-running dispute between the two sides of the firm. But since then, Andersen itself has beefed up its own consulting practice. According to a report in The New York Times, just over half the $52 million it billed Enron in 2000 was for consulting.\n",

It will help them compete on equal terms for global capital,\"Bolkestein said. He added that the legislation would require companies tobegin preparing their consolidated accounts using IAS by 2005.Bolkestein also said he is hopeful that the U.S. Securities and ExchangeCommission will begin to accept financial statements prepared by firms inthe European Union without requiring them to be reconciled with thegenerally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) standard used in the UnitedStates.A major reason that changes are needed in the European Union's financialregulations is because of the \"unprecedented volume of mergers andacquisitions\" between American and European firms.Another reason is that the European Union has established a goal of becoming\"the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world,capable of sustainable growth with more and better jobs, and greater socialcohesion,\" Bolkestein said.Since 1990, Bolkestein said the European community has added 900,000 jobsand has seen improved competition and productivity add 1.5 percent to grossdomestic product growth because of measures taken to create a single marketfor financial services.If the European Union is successful at restructuring its financial system by2005, Bolkestein said he sees other benefits to include a lower cost ofcapital for all companies, a deeper and more vibrant venture capital market,lower costs of purchasing financial products, and higher returns on pensionsand investment funds.To realize those benefits, Bolkestein said the European Commission wouldlike to see an integrated securities market in place by 2003, replacing theindividual domestic securities markets of the European Union's 15 memberstates.\"Mergers and alliances between existing exchanges are already breaking downbarriers, pooling liquidity, reducing clearing costs, decreasing volatility,and increasing transparency,\" Bolkestein said. He added that Europe is alsoseeing \"a marked increase in the number of on-line brokerage accounts, whichfurther contributes to efficiency and transparency,\" but also creates agreater need for changes in the way the European Union regulates itsfinancial sector.Top securities lawyer set to head SECFinancial Times - May 11, 2001By John LabatePresident George W.

Fed's Greenspan Comments on `Egregious' Accounting at Enron2002-01-24 12:40 (New York) Washington, Jan. 24 (Bloomberg) -- The following are comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on accounting practices at Enron Corp. Greenspan's remarks came during the question-and-answer part of testimony to the Senate Budget Committee. ``I think that the extraordinary response to Enron is something I think is very helpful and indeed an indication that the people in this society have required that we maintain a very high standard of trustworthiness in our business operations,'' Greenspan said. ``If everybody did what is alleged in the Enron accounting system, our system could not work,'' he said. ``That is, if you have a system, a market system, it works off information. If you don't have a way to evaluate a particular asset you cannot price it and if you cannot price it you cannot get the appropriate allocation of capital in a market society.'' As to Enron's accounting practices, Greenspan said: ``I think that was an egregious act. I tried as hard as I could to find an economic reason why those affiliates were constructed the way they were. The simplest explanation was the obvious explanation: that they did not want to indicate what their true earnings position was.'' Greenspan said he would be concerned about Enron's practices harming the economy ``if there wasn't a reaction to it.'' ``But the reaction, I think, is going to create a really major rethinking by a lot of people about whether there is a spin game going on with respect to the information coming out of business into the investment community,'' he said. While ``there's been an element of that'' in the past, ``I think there's going to be a good deal less of that. The old issue of competing for reputation is going to re-emerge. And I think you're going to find at some point that there are going to be people out there who are going to say `our accounts you can rely on' and that probably will increase their price-earnings ratios.''--Michael McKee in Washington (202) 624-1895 or mmckee@bloomberg.net.

      "Reasoning: The email quotes Greenspan as saying that Enron's accounting practices were \"egregious\" and that they did not want to indicate their true earnings position. This suggests a lack of transparency and honesty in the company's financial reporting, which is a red flag for potential abuse of accounting rules. While it does not explicitly state fraud or hiding losses, it implies a significant departure from good accounting practices, which warrants a score of 8 out of 10.\n",

[Fairley, David] The Marketing Strategy, the Trading and Risk Policy, and the Description of Asset Management have been upated. The other Exhibits have not been modified. The Marketing Strategy and Trading & Risk Policy have been discussed at length with MDEA (MDEA commercial, not legal), and their comments/questions incorporated.  7. It would help if theh commercial part of the team could send me the following, in words and/or formulae:The defn and method of establishing the bogey (target production cost) formula can be an exhibit, which would be great for the commercial team to work on. [Fairley, David] Thought we had this covered in the definitions and obligations of the parties. Will look at it again. Conceptually, MDEA, Services Group, and Orig are in full agreement, so we need to make sure that the contract language is clear enough.[Rorschach, Reagan] See attached exhibit detailing the calc with an example. Are we determined how we should deal with imbalances (part of cost of power)? [Fairley, David] There are three considerations on this: (1) who wears imbalance exposure?, (2) who manages imbalances (hourly type activity), and (3) who pays for imbalances? Imbalances are billed by Entergy directly to MDEA under their Network Services Agreement. EPMI's hourly desk manages the load/resource items hourly, but MDEA has the exposure (physical and price) to imbalances. Weather/load changes, and fluctuations in supply create hourly imbalances (they happen, they are uncontrollable, and we fix them) which EPMI's hourly desk manages as part of the imbalance service described in the definitions and obligations of the parties. A different section in the contract states that MDEA wears the exposure. How are we setting the bogey? Formula? [Fairley, David] The bogey is set when the load projection and stack models are run each day. Both parties participate by providing certain necessary info and discussing results and planning the day's activities. [Rorschach, Reagan] Records of bogey decisions will be archievedSubject to audit? [Fairley, David] Yes, but they would be auditing something that is jointly derived each day. Frankly, they would like to have less involvement; ie, they trust us to do it all, but we are requiring them to participate and buy in every day. Two bogeys or one (gas and oil)?[Fairley, David] One bogey for power. Gas is an input for determining the bogey.[Rorschach, Reagan] Bogey set day-ahead.What is defn of profit? I think I have the general idea, but a sentence or two would be helpful as a reality check. [Fairley, David] This is in the pricing calc's. Should we have a definition?\n",

The memo was addressed to two Andersen officials, including David Duncan, whoheaded the Enron account and who Andersen this week said it fired foroverseeing the destruction of Enron-related documents after learning thatfederal regulators were examining the energy-trading company's finances.  Mr. Duncan was quizzed at length yesterday by investigators for the HouseEnergy and Commerce Committee and the Justice Department in separate,closed-door sessions.

Mr. Duncan told the investigators he called the meetingbecause he was aware the Enron account posed \"significant risk,\" according toone person present during the questioning. The memo provided a \"To Do\" listthat included recommending that Enron's board review the fairness oftransactions with the LJM partnership.

Iexercise the restraint to which your story pines in many of myconsulting engagements which require financial give and take betweenclient and vendor. It is simply smart business to do so. I have beenthe beneficiary of the same with my local bank when errors occurred inmy checking accounts, or when loan payments were made absent mindedlylate, etc., and the late fee forgiven. However, much of our economy,and certainly the trade of a commodity such as electricity requires theuse of markets. Nameless and faceless, they do squeeze out all theefficiencies which lead to lower prices, more innovation, and a sharingof price risk with parties who are neither the ultimate consumer nor theinitial producer. The producer and consumer get out of the riskarbitrage and leave it to others who are more skilled and monied.I find it ironic that TURN, then, is so insistent on arguing, as it hasdone on many many occasions for the relaxation of market separation inthe ISO=01,s congestion management reform. Elimination of marketseparation is nothing more than the impersonal forcing of parties toexecute trades on either side of a congested transmission path in thename of market efficiency. Lower prices for consumers. Does it reallymatter if it is done through person to person transactions, or throughmarkets?Third, your story can be used to make an alternative point. Whathappens to the merchant in town when Wal-Mart moves into the next towndown the road? All the faithful customers that your Merchant ofVengeance was protecting suddenly migrate to a competitor with greaterinventory, more choice, and lower prices. What do you say, then? Thecorollary for us is direct. The new generation owners moved literallybillions of dollars into California, at risk, and took a chance. Itpaid off. They succeeded as we all know this year, and probably willnext year, and so on. But the 3,000 MW of new power plants underconstruction in California, and the 3,000 MW under construction inArizona, and the over 16,000 MW of combined power projects inCalifornia, Arizona, and Southern Nevada that are in line for permitswill change the financial landscape in a hurry once energized. Theprices will soften, returns will be less cherry, and I really want toknow, where will today=01,s accusers be when there is a shake out?Consumers will reap that benefit, oh you best believe it. But thealliances to which your opening story alludes simply misses that point.You gotta make hay while the sun shines.\n",

      "Skipping His remarks, made to members of the Dallas business community attending Southern Methodist University's Cox School of Business management briefing series, came on the same day that Enron (ENE: news, msgs, alerts) filed its annual proxy statement.In the proxy, Enron's financially robust 2000 translated into healthy bonuses for both Skilling and Chairman Kenneth Lay. Lay's bonus shot up to $7 million in 2000 from $3.9 million in 1999, while Skilling took home $5.6 million in bonus pay, up from $3 million the previous year. Enron named Skilling CEO in February.The No. 1 buyer and seller of natural gas in the U.S. and the leading wholesale power marketer had $100.8 billion in sales in 2000, up from $20.36 billion in 1997. During the same period, its earnings-per-share increased to $1.47 from 87 cents a share, a 25 percent gain, and its market cap climbed to $62.5 billion from $12.8 billion.Last week, Enron's market cap declined on rumors, which the company denied in a press release and subsequent conference call, of problems in its broadband business. Shares of Enron, which set a 52-week low of $51.51 a share on March 22, shed $1.02 to close at $60.46 on Tuesday.On Tuesday, Skilling said he expected bandwidth trading, now a nominal part of Enron's overall business, to contribute 10 to 15 percent to the company's bottom line in the next four to five years.In a conference call Friday, Skilling reiterated that Enron remains comfortable with its previously announced profit target of $1.70 to $1.75 a share in 2001. The average estimate of analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial is $1.74 a share.On Tuesday, Skilling maintained his view and also said the company is comfortable with expectations for a profit of 45 cents a share in the March quarter.Enron a business maverick\"Enron has changed the way a lot of people think about the energy business,\" Skilling said. \"The one good idea is that the traditional, rigid, capital-intensive vertically integrated business structures...are breaking down.\"Skilling, who received a bachelor degree from SMU, said its better to search for the highest quality products and assemble them into a package for delivery to customers rather than owning them all. He said that the business model is superior because it's cheaper and more flexible.\"Virtual integration will beat vertical integration every day,\" said Skilling, predicting that in the future people will work for the system, rather than the product, and that physical capital will be replaced with intellectual capital. Enron, he said, created the packaging concept back in the late 1980s and assembled it in a way that enables energy to be delivered at lower costs.\"That's what led to the growth at our company,\" he said. Skilling said he intends for Enron to be the most innovative company in America for years to come.Lisa Sanders is a Dallas-based reporter for CBS.MarketWatch.com. llama2-uncensored 0\n"
