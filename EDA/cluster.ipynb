      "I met with Gordon yesterday and have up-to-date information on the public and private hedges we placed in Raptors 1 and 2.  There has been value loss there.  The following are the current values for R1. I shall cross-check the values again before we model these into our liquidation valuation.\n",
      "For R2, HC is the only remaining value, it appears.  However, we have already entered into a contract with Bear and Stearns who are shorting HC presently and wll settle with Enron around October, 2001, after Enron makes its sale.  So, it may not be relevant if we want to look at the liquidation value at maturity from a volatility perspective.\n",

The main assumption, however, was that the assets in the Raptor structure would not devalue.  Of course, for the public equities such as AVICI this is simply not the case.  At the time of the initial analysis in March, AVCI traded at roughly $17 / share and it now trades at $3.65 / share on approximately 1.1 million shares.  OOPS!\n",

For example:   With a strike of $80,  if ENE price drop down to $20, the intrinsic value of the option is $60 which means ENE will have to hand over $60/$20=3 shares.   But if ENE price drop down to $10, ENE still only hand over 3 shares, with $30 in value.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) When options exercised, Enron will have share dilution but no impact on Enron income.\n",
      "\n",
      "5) A good portion of the public equities have been liquidated by Raptor at a substantial discount. (I have the list and the share numbers) The notional value of all the swapped assets at the time of Raptor inception was $733.68 MM.  Current value of assets remain in Raptors are $141.8 MM.\n",

The company's extensive use of derivatives both inside and outside the company can likely be directly linked to its collapse. Enron reaped huge profits from derivatives but lost billions on most everything else they did. On the outside, they were used to create the company's web of off-balance sheet deals with complex financial partnerships known as special-purpose vehicles. After some of those deals went sour, Enron in October took a $1 billion charge against earnings and a $1.2 billion write-down in shareholder equity, triggering its nosedive into bankruptcy. But Enron's derivatives problems ran far deeper than the outside special purpose vehicles.

      "-----Original Message----- Subject: Re: Enron II October 28, 2001 Plumbing Mystery of Deals by Enron <<...OLE_Obj...>> T the heart of the sudden collapse in investor confidence in the Enron Corporation (news/quote </redirect/marketwatch/redirect.ctx?MW=http://custom.marketwatch.com/custom/nyt-com/html-companyprofile.asp&symb=ENE >) are unusual trades it entered into with partnerships led by its chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, beginning in the summer of 1999. Because they were transactions among related parties, the company was required to disclose them, but the disclosures raised as many questions as they answered. Following are some questions that investors are asking, and the currently available answers.Q. Why did Enron enter into the deals?A. Enron's first disclosures, in 1999, gave no reason. In later reports, it said it was seeking to \"hedge certain merchant investments and other assets,\" by which it apparently meant investments in technology and telecommunications companies.Q. How did those investments do?A. It looks as if they plunged in value, although there is no clear disclosure on that.Q. Why can't that be discerned?A. The company never said just what the investments were. And the transactions with the partnerships were complicated, involving a variety of derivative securities, Enron stock and various promissory notes. Enron's financial disclosures do not provide enough information to understand the arrangements completely.Q. Why were they so complicated?A. One reason may have been to use accounting rules to its advantage. One accounting rule dictates that companies may not record profits or losses on transactions in their own stock. If a company sells its shares at $10 each and then buys them back - whether for $1 or $50 - there is no gain or loss. But shareholder equity does go up or down on the balance sheet - in that case reflecting how much extra cash the company took in, or paid out, on the transactions. Enron's transactions appear to have been structured to fall under that rule.Q. Who made money from these transactions?A. Enron reported some profits along the way from the deals, although not all of the profits were spelled out in its quarterly filings. And it appears that the partnerships distributed money to investors.Q. If the deals began in 1999, why all the uproar now?A. Many investors and analysts were not curious about them when everything seemed to be going well. As long as Enron was exceeding its forecasted profits each quarter, they were willing to assume that what was not being disclosed was not really important.Q. When were concerns raised with Enron?\n",

Kaplan Fox Seeks To Recover Losses For Investors Who Purchased E2001-10-25 12:07 (New York)Kaplan Fox Seeks To Recover Losses For Investors Who Purchased EnronCorp. Common StockNEW YORK, NY -- (INTERNET WIRE) -- 10/25/01 -- Kaplan Fox(kaplanfox.com) has filed a class action against Enron Corp. andcertain of the Company's officers and directors in the United StatesDistrict Court for the Southern District of Texas. The suit isbrought on behalf of all persons or entities who purchased the commonstock of Enron Corporation (\"Enron\") (NYSE: ENE) between January 18,2000 and October 17, 2001, inclusive (the \"Class Period\").The complaint charges Enron Corp. and certain of its officers anddirectors with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.The complaint alleges that during the Class Period, defendantsengaged in asset and securities sales to closely related affiliatesand interested parties, which disguised Enron's true financialposition. Many of the details of these transactions were hidden fromthe public. Defendants used these asset sales to falsely improveEnron's balance sheet, thereby maintaining Enron shares at anartificially inflated price. Certain Enron executives, who heldpositions in the affiliates that presented clear conflicts ofinterest, reaped millions of dollars in personal gains from thesetransactions.The complaint further alleges that during the Class Period, Defendantsmade misleading statements regarding the potential value of Enron'sBroadband business, in order to artificially boost Enron's shareprice. With knowledge that Enron's Broadband business would neverpost a profit and was seriously overvalued, Defendants continued tomake misleading statements about the Broadband business in order tomaintain the share price at its artificially inflated levels.Defendants used the artificially inflated value of Enron's Broadbandbusiness to hedge against, in order to gain millions of dollars infinancing. Defendants failed to disclose the risk of these financingarrangements. Defendants hid the true nature of Enron's earnings,its hedging, its businesses, and the correct state of Enron'sfinances from its investors and the market, further artificiallyinflating Enron's share price. While the stock was artificiallyinflated for the above reasons, Enron executives engaged in extensiveinsider trading, gaining personal proceeds of approximately $482million during the Class Period, before the public became aware ofthe above practices.Plaintiff seeks to recover damages on behalf of the Class and isrepresented by Kaplan Fox & Kilsheimer LLP. Our firm, with officesin New York, San Francisco, Chicago and New Jersey has many years ofexperience in prosecuting investor class actions and actionsinvolving financial fraud.

      "Enron reported more than $16 billion in gains from derivatives over the three years to 2000, Partnoy said. He said the alleged false entries \"were systematic and occurred over several years, beginning as early as 1997.\" Partnoy said some Enron traders had misused so-called \"prudency reserves,\" meant to reflect the inherent uncertainty about future profits from derivatives deals, as rainy-day funds to smooth out their profits and losses over time. Some had also apparently deliberately misvalued the forward rate curves used to determine the current value of their derivatives portfolios in order to hide losses, he said. \"I cannot offer fact testimony as to any of these matters,\" Partnoy told the committee. \"Nonetheless, I strongly believe the information I have gathered is credible. It is from many sources, including written information, e-mail correspondence and telephone interviews.\" At least eight congressional committees, as well as the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice, are probing Enron's fall from grace and Partnoy said the episode should raise major questions about the regulation of derivatives as well as capital markets in general. \"The collapse of Enron makes it plain that the key gatekeeper institutions that support our system of market capitalism have failed,\" he said. \"The institutions sharing the blame include auditors, law firms, banks, securities analysts, independent directors and credit rating agencies.\"\n",

The plaintiffs are represented by Clinton Krislov, Michael Karnuth, and Michael Rosenblat, of Krislov & Associates, Chicago, Illinois and Michael Bradford, of Benckenstein & Oxford, Baumont, Texas. The suit was filed on behalf of Enron, to redress damages to the Company from Enron's investments in limited partnerships which were controlled by Andrew Fastow, Enron's then Chief Financial Officer, and approved by Enron's Board of Directors. These transactions resulted in losses to Enron estimated to be at least $35 million and a reduction in shareholders' equity of at least $1.2 billion. The suit alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties of loyalty and due care that they owed to Enron and its stockholders.\",\n",

      "Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) still hasn't come clean on the shadowy deals that led to many of the company's problems. \n",
      "The battered power giant restated more than three years' worth of financials Thursday because previous numbers failed to take into account complex deals with a number of affiliated entities. As a result of the restatements, annual recurring earnings in the 1997-2000 period are now 10% to 25% lower than originally reported. \n",
      "However, the picture could be even worse. The restatements of recurring earnings left out nearly $1 billion of losses suffered by a related entity called LJM2 in 2000 and 2001. Losses suffered by a similarly structured entity called LJM1 were factored into the restatement, while LJM2's were not. Enron didn't comment, but the press release detailing the restatements appears to argue that LJM1 was too thinly capitalized and, as such, it should always have been consolidated in Enron's core numbers. The inference, therefore, is that LJM2 losses weren't included because the entity was better capitalized than LJM1. \n",
      "But that explanation isn't holding water in many quarters. In fact, the exclusion of LJM2 could be a source of further controversy for Enron. Enron fell 64 cents Thursday to $8.41. \n",
      "Pulling a Fastow?\n",
      "LJM2 has received much scrutiny in recent weeks, and is primarily responsible for events that have cratered Enron stock. The entity was led by Enron's now-ousted CFO Andrew Fastow, and the Securities and Exchange Commission is looking at the transactions Enron did with LJM2. In addition, these transactions prompted a $1.2 billion reduction in Enron's equity in the third quarter. Among investors in LJM2 were Credit Suisse First Boston, Wachovia, General Electric and the Arkansas Teachers Fund, according to recent reports in The Wall Street Journal. \n",
      "It appears from other public documents that LJM2 could not have entered the deals that led to the losses if Enron had not agreed to issue $1.2 billion of stock. If so, the LJM2 deals weren't as arms length as Enron might want to project right now. \n",
      "Therefore, to get a truer picture of Enron's profitability, investors should factor the LJM2-related losses into restated numbers. The result isn't pretty: The $1 billion of LJM2-related losses would've reduced the restated recurring earnings for 2000 and 2001 by some 30%. True, a portion of these losses were included in October's initial release of third-quarter financials, but they were taken as a charge that Enron asked investors to leave out of the recurring profits number that is supposed to give investors a view of core earnings power.\n",

I would \\nlike you to please spend some time with him, and then based on the discussion \\nplease send us a note detailing how sucha a transaction would be marked to \\nmarket.\\n\\nPlease cosider the fact that currently there are no such transactions from \\nthe Indian side.  This is a very important transaction for us, and we may \\nneed to repeat this in coming months, hence setting up the system to account \\nfor these maybe well worth it.  Also, what I am concerned about is that there \\nwill be an Enron India (EIPL) account in India based on Indian GAAP, and upon \\nconsolidation there will be a US GAAP accounting in the US.  It is here that \\nwe would like to have mark-to-market accounting.  EIPL is structured through \\nMauritius, and then Caymen Islands.\\n\\nAnother key question to consider is that when we m-t-m the transaction in the \\nUS there will be a tax accruing in the year of m-t-m (say 2000).  However, in \\nIndia, as a result of the accrual accounting, there will not be any income \\nshowing till the year 2002 or 2003.  We will need to know how that would get \\ntreated, and whether there is a way to get credit for the tax payable in the \\nUS.  I am also confused about whether US tax would be levied, since none of \\nthe income is being brought back into the US (remains overseas - subpart-F \\nand other concerns).\\n\\nFinally, we have been working hard in structuring a fixed price contract and \\ngetting a fixed for floating swap in the US (this is still not allowed to \\nIndian Corporates).  I need you to think about this too, and see if some type \\nof accounting will solve this issue.  Krishna knows what I am talking about, \\nand will brief you on the same.\\n\\nKrishna - Please walk Bob through the three structures we had worked here.\\n\\nLook forward to your help and comments.  This is going to be an exciting \\nproject for us all.\\n\\nRegards,\\nSandeep.\": [203059,\n",
