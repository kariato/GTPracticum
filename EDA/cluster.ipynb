      "Skipping His remarks, made to members of the Dallas business community attending Southern Methodist University's Cox School of Business management briefing series, came on the same day that Enron (ENE: news, msgs, alerts) filed its annual proxy statement.In the proxy, Enron's financially robust 2000 translated into healthy bonuses for both Skilling and Chairman Kenneth Lay. Lay's bonus shot up to $7 million in 2000 from $3.9 million in 1999, while Skilling took home $5.6 million in bonus pay, up from $3 million the previous year. Enron named Skilling CEO in February.The No. 1 buyer and seller of natural gas in the U.S. and the leading wholesale power marketer had $100.8 billion in sales in 2000, up from $20.36 billion in 1997. During the same period, its earnings-per-share increased to $1.47 from 87 cents a share, a 25 percent gain, and its market cap climbed to $62.5 billion from $12.8 billion.Last week, Enron's market cap declined on rumors, which the company denied in a press release and subsequent conference call, of problems in its broadband business. Shares of Enron, which set a 52-week low of $51.51 a share on March 22, shed $1.02 to close at $60.46 on Tuesday.On Tuesday, Skilling said he expected bandwidth trading, now a nominal part of Enron's overall business, to contribute 10 to 15 percent to the company's bottom line in the next four to five years.In a conference call Friday, Skilling reiterated that Enron remains comfortable with its previously announced profit target of $1.70 to $1.75 a share in 2001. The average estimate of analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial is $1.74 a share.On Tuesday, Skilling maintained his view and also said the company is comfortable with expectations for a profit of 45 cents a share in the March quarter.Enron a business maverick\"Enron has changed the way a lot of people think about the energy business,\" Skilling said. \"The one good idea is that the traditional, rigid, capital-intensive vertically integrated business structures...are breaking down.\"Skilling, who received a bachelor degree from SMU, said its better to search for the highest quality products and assemble them into a package for delivery to customers rather than owning them all. He said that the business model is superior because it's cheaper and more flexible.\"Virtual integration will beat vertical integration every day,\" said Skilling, predicting that in the future people will work for the system, rather than the product, and that physical capital will be replaced with intellectual capital. Enron, he said, created the packaging concept back in the late 1980s and assembled it in a way that enables energy to be delivered at lower costs.\"That's what led to the growth at our company,\" he said. Skilling said he intends for Enron to be the most innovative company in America for years to come.Lisa Sanders is a Dallas-based reporter for CBS.MarketWatch.com. llama2-uncensored 0\n"

      "Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) still hasn't come clean on the shadowy deals that led to many of the company's problems. \n",
      "The battered power giant restated more than three years' worth of financials Thursday because previous numbers failed to take into account complex deals with a number of affiliated entities. As a result of the restatements, annual recurring earnings in the 1997-2000 period are now 10% to 25% lower than originally reported. \n",
      "However, the picture could be even worse. The restatements of recurring earnings left out nearly $1 billion of losses suffered by a related entity called LJM2 in 2000 and 2001. Losses suffered by a similarly structured entity called LJM1 were factored into the restatement, while LJM2's were not. Enron didn't comment, but the press release detailing the restatements appears to argue that LJM1 was too thinly capitalized and, as such, it should always have been consolidated in Enron's core numbers. The inference, therefore, is that LJM2 losses weren't included because the entity was better capitalized than LJM1. \n",
      "But that explanation isn't holding water in many quarters. In fact, the exclusion of LJM2 could be a source of further controversy for Enron. Enron fell 64 cents Thursday to $8.41. \n",
      "Pulling a Fastow?\n",
      "LJM2 has received much scrutiny in recent weeks, and is primarily responsible for events that have cratered Enron stock. The entity was led by Enron's now-ousted CFO Andrew Fastow, and the Securities and Exchange Commission is looking at the transactions Enron did with LJM2. In addition, these transactions prompted a $1.2 billion reduction in Enron's equity in the third quarter. Among investors in LJM2 were Credit Suisse First Boston, Wachovia, General Electric and the Arkansas Teachers Fund, according to recent reports in The Wall Street Journal. \n",
      "It appears from other public documents that LJM2 could not have entered the deals that led to the losses if Enron had not agreed to issue $1.2 billion of stock. If so, the LJM2 deals weren't as arms length as Enron might want to project right now. \n",
      "Therefore, to get a truer picture of Enron's profitability, investors should factor the LJM2-related losses into restated numbers. The result isn't pretty: The $1 billion of LJM2-related losses would've reduced the restated recurring earnings for 2000 and 2001 by some 30%. True, a portion of these losses were included in October's initial release of third-quarter financials, but they were taken as a charge that Enron asked investors to leave out of the recurring profits number that is supposed to give investors a view of core earnings power.\n",

I would \\nlike you to please spend some time with him, and then based on the discussion \\nplease send us a note detailing how sucha a transaction would be marked to \\nmarket.\\n\\nPlease cosider the fact that currently there are no such transactions from \\nthe Indian side.  This is a very important transaction for us, and we may \\nneed to repeat this in coming months, hence setting up the system to account \\nfor these maybe well worth it.  Also, what I am concerned about is that there \\nwill be an Enron India (EIPL) account in India based on Indian GAAP, and upon \\nconsolidation there will be a US GAAP accounting in the US.  It is here that \\nwe would like to have mark-to-market accounting.  EIPL is structured through \\nMauritius, and then Caymen Islands.\\n\\nAnother key question to consider is that when we m-t-m the transaction in the \\nUS there will be a tax accruing in the year of m-t-m (say 2000).  However, in \\nIndia, as a result of the accrual accounting, there will not be any income \\nshowing till the year 2002 or 2003.  We will need to know how that would get \\ntreated, and whether there is a way to get credit for the tax payable in the \\nUS.  I am also confused about whether US tax would be levied, since none of \\nthe income is being brought back into the US (remains overseas - subpart-F \\nand other concerns).\\n\\nFinally, we have been working hard in structuring a fixed price contract and \\ngetting a fixed for floating swap in the US (this is still not allowed to \\nIndian Corporates).  I need you to think about this too, and see if some type \\nof accounting will solve this issue.  Krishna knows what I am talking about, \\nand will brief you on the same.\\n\\nKrishna - Please walk Bob through the three structures we had worked here.\\n\\nLook forward to your help and comments.  This is going to be an exciting \\nproject for us all.\\n\\nRegards,\\nSandeep.\": [203059,\n",
