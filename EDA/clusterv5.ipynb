      "3841 2251 Subject: RE: assignment of trade to Raptor vehicleI assume that what this e-mail relates to is the discussed \"transfer\" of the 2 LDC swaps from Raptor 2 to Raptor 4. Frankly, I do not know what it means to assign a swap from 1 of these vehicles to another vehicle. I think that in general the schedules to the ISDAs that each of the 2 sets of parties executed are the same, but what happens in the case of differences? My rather simplistic approach would be to terminate the existing swaps in Raptor 2 and execute new swaps at the same time and on the same terms in Raptor 4. Unless anyone objects, I propose that we proceed along the lines outlined above, using the Raptor process documentation developed by Lisa and recently updated by Gordon.We recently [like yesterday] received closing books on Raptor 3 and distributed those. If Anyone needs documentation on the other 3 structures, let us know....[Realizing that they are about to change due to the planned merger of Raptor 1, 2 and 4 into Mega-Raptor -- sounds like a bad Rug-Rats movie I recently had the misfortune of viewing doesn't it?] -----Original Message-----Subject: Re: assignment of trade to Raptor vehicleNo. I guess the first step is to know into which Raptor the swaps are moving and to get Joel to give us a closing book on that Raptor so we can get the correct parties etc. Attached is an assignment/assumption document I drafted for the VPP transaction which might be helpful (of course, it has a lot of inapplicable specifics) . We ought to also check with Joel about any provisions in the rest of the vehicle docs that may apply to an assignment. I would think that if all parties join and consent and provide no ED or TE under the ISDAs shall occur on the basis of the assignment that it would be clean from the ISDA point of view.

Here are the main points:1) After the March fix-up, Raptor hedged ENE credit capacity all the way down to ENE $20/share. And the collars are consists of European type options. The maturities are: original collars for Raptor I, II, IV will mature in 2003. The new collars for Raptor II and IV will mature in 2005. 2) The collars were transacted with ENE.3) The option settling method will be equity method. Enron will hand over shares at the maturity. But there is a maximum 3 share per option limit. For example: With a strike of $80, if ENE price drop down to $20, the intrinsic value of the option is $60 which means ENE will have to hand over $60/$20=3 shares. But if ENE price drop down to $10, ENE still only hand over 3 shares, with $30 in value.4) When options exercised, Enron will have share dilution but no impact on Enron income.5) A good portion of the public equities have been liquidated by Raptor at a substantial discount. (I have the list and the share numbers) The notional value of all the swapped assets at the time of Raptor inception was $733.68 MM. Current value of assets remain in Raptors are $141.8 MM.6) While the raptors have hedged Enron's credit capacities, the current Enron credit capacity dropped from around ($36MM) after the fix up, to around ($237MM) as of 8/20/01.Hope these information help answering some of the question you had.Ding.\n",

If Anyone needs documentation on the other 3 structures, let us know....[Realizing that they are about to change due to the planned merger of Raptor 1, 2 and 4 into Mega-Raptor -- sounds like a bad Rug-Rats movie I recently had the misfortune of viewing doesn't it?] -----Original Message-----Subject: Re: assignment of trade to Raptor vehicleNo. I guess the first step is to know into which Raptor the swaps are moving and to get Joel to give us a closing book on that Raptor so we can get the correct parties etc. Attached is an assignment/assumption document I drafted for the VPP transaction which might be helpful (of course, it has a lot of inapplicable specifics) . We ought to also check with Joel about any provisions in the rest of the vehicle docs that may apply to an assignment.

Enron provided its stock to the Raptor in exchange for a promisso=ry note. LJM2, a partnership run by senior Enron executives and financed by= outside investors, invested $30 million in the Raptor. In return, LJM2 was= promised at least a 30 percent return. 2 Recouping LJM2's Investment The R=aptor could not operate until LJM2 had recouped its investment and made a p=rofit. Enron paid the Raptor $41 milion for a contract that allowed Enron t=o sell the Raptor a certain amount of its stock at a fixed price sometime i=n the future. The Raptor gave the $41 million to LJM2, thereby repaying LJM=2's investment and giving it a profit of $11 million -- enough to satisfy i=ts investors. 3 Putting the Raptor to Work With LJM2 paid off, Enron made a= contract with the Raptor in which the Raptor agreed to cover any losses fr=om certain Enron investments if those investments declined in value. In ret=urn, the Raptor was promised any gains if the investments appreciated in va=lue. The Problem -- The agreement between Enron and the Raptor protected En=ron from a decline in the value of its investments only if the Raptor was a=ble to cover those losses. That was possible only if the Raptor's principal= asset -- Enron's stock -- rose in value.

The Master Derivatives Agreement (\"MDA\") requires that the Proposal Sheets describe the \"Assets\" with respect to which the derivative transaction is to be executed. For purposes of the MDA, \"Assets\" is defined as \"assets, including without limitation common stock, partnership interests, member interests. other ownership interests, and other financial and physical assets.\" Therefore, the description should include both the nature of the \"Asset\" (i.e. whether it is an equity interest, a loan, working interest, etc.) and a little bit about the company (the entity in which ENA holds the interest or has the loan or working interest).Any comments to the Proposal Sheets should be delivered ASAP to the \"Enron person completing this form\" (This is the 3rd line under the heading \"GENERAL\" on each of the Proposal Sheets) along with a request that a revised Proposal Sheet be returned to the lawyer providing comments with copies to both Mary Cook and Lisa Mellencamp.

      "4419 2829 1.) V&E is currently drafting documents to allow each Raptor structure to look to the other structures in terms of credit capacity. 2.) The previously proposed assignment of the LDC swaps from Raptor II to Raptor IV is off the table. These swaps will now be terminated.3.) Either Raptor II or Raptor IV will be used to hedge the Mariner investment ($360M) instead. 4.) The JEDI structure is expected to be unwound thus allowing 12M Enron Corp. shares to come back to Enron Corp. and no longer be treated as issued and outstanding for purposes of Enron's EPS calculation. 5.) The value of 12M new Enron Corp. shares would be used to capitalize either Raptor II or Raptor IV (12M shares x $70 = approx. $840M).  a.) As consideration for the contribution of the shares, the receivable owed by the lower tier LLC to the Enron member under the grid note would be increased by the same amount. b.) The credit capacity of the subject Raptor structure would increase by an amount equal to the discount on the shares caused by their restricted nature. ($840M x 35% to 45% = approx. $294M to $378M)  c.) Ryan has apparently suggested that the shares actually be transferred to a trust and that the trust issue a forward contract on the shares to the chosen Raptor structure. We have some concerns about this approach from a tax perspective. I would like to better understand the benefits of using a forward contract, who would own the beneficial interest in the trust, and what follow-on transactions might be planned regarding the trust. d.) I am still confused about the characterization of the contribution of the additional shares as utilizing the credit capacity of the Raptor structure to which they are contributed. I can understand why the shares would not increase the credit capacity of the structure, but I am told that the potential downside on the Enron stock would actually utilize the structure's capacity.

As I read the memo below, I am instructed to advise you about the nature of the underlying asset. The asset is Series B Preferred Stock of Catalytica Combustion Systems, Inc., and an option to acquire same. Currently, pursuant to a Series B Stock Purchase Agreement among Catalytica Combustion Systems, Inc. ( CCSI), Catalytica, Inc. ( CCSI's parent and currently holder of Series A and common stock of CCSI representing approximately 83% of the ownership of CCSI ) and Enron Ventures Corp. ( predecessor in interest to Sundance Assets, L.P.), Sundance owns 1,339,286 shares of Series B Preferred Stock and an option to purchase 535,715 shares of Series B Preferred Stock. There are provisions calling for the adjustment of the number of option shares subject to the option but I am not aware that any transactions that would cause such adjustment provisions, other that the stock split referred to below, to apply. The Series B stock is convertible to CCSI common stock, is restricted stock, and the Stock Purchase Agreement provides for registration rights. Currently, Tom White and Jack Urquhart both serve on the CCSI Boards of Directors, and Jack serves on the Catalytica Inc. Board.Under an Omnibus Agreement entered into in September 2000, in connection with the restructuring of Enron's transactions with CCSI and in connection with the proposed acquisition of Catalytica, Inc, by a third party ( DSM, a Dutch pharmaceutical company) and the distribution of Catalytica's CCSI shares to Catalytica's stockholders immediately prior to that acquisition, we agreed to convert the Series B to CCSI common, agreed to vote for a 2 for 1 stock split, and negotiated a cashless exercise of the option after the effective date of the spin off. The effectiveness of these provisions is dependent upon the effectiveness of distribution and acquisition The option itself ( as amended by the Omnibus Agreement and otherwise ) expires January 14, 2001. The distribution is expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2000, but is subject to a variety of conditions. After the distribution and concurrent closing of the Catalyica acquisition transaction, CCSI ( which formerly looked to its parent for financing and much of its administrative and other support) will be a stand- alone public company listed on NASDAQ, with the uncertainties attendant thereto.\n",

As I likely will not return to the office until just at the time of September close, I thought it might make sense for you, with Brent's assistance, to make sure that the appropriate reporting personnel are notified of the tax adjustments that should be made to book these transactions.Each of the \"top tier\" Raptor entities (Harrier, Roadrunner, Pronghorn, and Grizzly) \"purchased\" from LJM the membership interest that LJM owned in the \"bottom tier\" Raptor entities (Talon, Bobcat, Porcupine, and Timberwlf, respectively). Harrier paid $6 mil, Roadrunner and Grizzly each paid $15 mil, and Pronghorn paid $1,000. As a result of these transactions, the purchased entities became book consolidated with Enron. Also as a result of these transactions, a total book loss of around $600 mil was recorded (divided among the books of each one of the four structures). For tax purposes, the purchasing and purchased entities are all disregarded entities of Enron Corp. (or EES, in the case of Pronghorn and Porcupine). The repurchases are to be treated as merely a final payment made by Enron Corp. (or EES, as the case may be) on a contingent debt instrument. Accordingly, the entire book loss should be reversed for tax, and instead an interest deduction recorded on the tax books of each purchasing entity for the amount that was paid to purchase the bottom tier entity. For examply, Harrier will record an interest expense deduction for $6 mil. We have not been told yet exactly how the book loss will be spread among the four structures, and whether it will be booked on the top tier or bottom tier entities' books. Ron Baker likely will have an answer on this issue by the time you see this message. Please leave me a voice mail if you need assistance before I return to the office on October 10. Thanks! DMD\n",

      "3069 1479 Subject: Equity Hedges for CEG, CEG Rio and Gaspart LDCsI understand that management has decided to hedge our equity interests in these three assets. I've been asked to complete this on Monday of next week (sorry for the short notice, I think this decision was made only yesterday). These hedges will be done in a structured hedging facility known as Raptor 2.In order to write the confirms and complete this process, we'll need at least to do the following. We'll need a complete description of the equity interest we're hedging. We'll need the full legal name of the issuer of the equity interest, a full legal description of the equity interest (common stock, preferred stock, warrants, etc.), the number of the certificate (if any) representing the interest and the number of shares or warrants being hedged.I understand that the hedge will be structured as a price return swap and the initial equity notional amount of the swap will be based on the book value of the equity interest. It would be helpful to see the latest financial statements showing that book value.We will also need to investigate whether any contractual or other legal restrictions may affect our ability to enter into these hedges.This is an initial list that I've prepared very quickly. I'll be reviewing this with Sara later today and will supplement this email as necessary.Randy, I've tried to reach Frank this morning but he is traveling.

As any buyout price for CALPERS will reflect the state of the assets at closing, I think we are well hedged until the closing of the restructuring. We can see if we can reserve some Raptor capacity upfront to hege us moving forward from the restructuring closin. If this does not answer your question, let me know.

      " {\"email_text\":\"Chart of senior executives included: Andrew S. Fastow, Chief financial officer; Michael J. Kooper, Managing director Enron Global Equity Markets Group; Ben Glisan Jr., Vice president Enron Global Equity Markets Group; LJM2 formed: Oct. 1999; Outside investors: Citicorp, American Home Assurance Company, AIG, Travelers Insurance, Morgan Stanley; General Partners: Mr. Fastow, Mr. Kooper, Mr. Glisan; Raptor Subsidiary partnerships created to invest in Enron holdings. Enron lent $1.2 billion of its stock to the Raptor partnerships; Enron promised to issue more stock if the value of the Raptor investments fell, thus ensuring the solvency of the partnerships; LJM2 invested millions of dollars in the Raptor partnerships; Raptor invested in some of Enron's assets, like power plants and gas pipelines. It also bought some of the stocks that Enron had invested in, particularly New Power Holdings, a company Enron had spun off. What went wrong; The interests of LJM2 and Enron were at odds; At one point, in September 2000, LJM2 entered into an agreement that obligated it to buy Enron stock at a fixed price anytime Enron wanted to sell over the next six months; This was a way for Enron to protect itself against a decline in its stock price. But LJM2 asked to settle the contract early when it could pay less for the stock than its current price, thereby making $10 million. Selling some of its stockholdings and assets to the Raptor partnerships insulated Enron against a decline in their value. But, when the value of those assets declined precipitously, Enron was obligated to provide more of its own stock to keep the partnerships solvent. Worse, as its own stock declined, it became necessary to issue more and more stock, further diluting the value of the stock held by its shareholders.\",\n",

I don't want to post an advetisement only I want them to post the turbines themselves. So essentially just like a new product launch we would have a pop up announcing a new product and the new product would be our turbines - exactly the same as any other product. They have to post the turbines out there and obviously there will only be an offer and they will be for the ABBs we actually have in Canada.

Short answer-- we've got it as covered as possible for now.

Jay confirmed that it was technically feasible to craft a pop-up that targets certain customers with information and links to documents and spec sheets. I'm told we have resisted this approach in the past because it has the potential to get out of hand once the genie gets out of the bottle, so to speak.

This is because of the additional tax exposure which would potentially attach to the income generated by other businesses in ENA.A decision not to use a separate legal entity in the UK (alternative C ) attracts a tax disbenefit. I will estimate the tax costs/benefits of the alternatives A thru C so that they can be factored into the overall cost/benefit analysis. Do you have an estimate of the net income before tax which will be earned by the Softs business, split between NY activity and London activity ? Maybe this can be taken from the budgets for 2001 ?RegardsJanineJanine Juggins01/02/2001 17:49Bruce/NA/Enron@EnronSubject: Softs structureAttached is a (very) draft note discussing the various alternative structures addressed during various telephone calls.

Class B Preferred Stock granted under the Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement in the 1997 Catalytica transaction, as modified by the September 2000 Omnibus Agreement to provide for its cashless exercise for CCSI common stock only on a 1 for 1 basis ( assuming no adjustments for CCSI recapitalization and the like under the adjustment provisions in the Stock Purchase Agreement occur prior to the exercise ), is to be included in the Raptor transaction. I'm not sure I'm the party to say whether it should be or not, however. I noted in a memo received earlier today from Stuart Zisman that the option shares were not included in the shareholdings total in that memo, and perhaps a separate memo will be prepared for the option itself as it is my understanding the option or the shares underlying it are part of our valuation of the CCSI holdings. I was advised prior to finalizing the Omnibus Agreement that the CCSI shares and the option are held by Sundance Assets, L.P., an Enron affiliate and transferee from Enron Ventures, Inc. ( the party to the 1997 Stock Purchase Agreement).The Stock Purchase Agreement, the Omnibus Agreement and CCSI's pending form S-1 registration statement ,filed last week with the SEC, and CCSI's parent's form of merger proxy statement, also filed with the SEC last week, all have been forwarded to Sara. The SEC filings were required in connection with the contemplated spin off of Cataltyca's CCSI holdings to Cataltyica's stockholders in connection with the acquisition of Cataltyica by DSM, anticipated to be closed by year end or shortly thereafter.

Just easier to decipher.Rose/Lisa, I've added some SPV language.I'm added receipt of final payment as an exception to the credit rating=20standard. In other words, if they have received their final payment, they==20can't use credit as a reason to not give consent.I don't think we should agree to provide a list of power projects done by t=he=20assignee in the past 5 years. I also think 3 years is a bit much on audite=d=20financials, but I didn't comment there.I don't like their language that an affiliate must be intending to=20own/operate the plant. I've just bracketed the langauge and added=20\"construct\", since I don't know if this point has already been agreed.Enough explanation, here it is (with Word file attached below):Except for as described in Section ___ [ next paragraph], neither Party sha=ll=20assign any or all of their duties or rights under this Contract without pri=or=20written consent from the other Party; such consent not to be unreasonably==20withheld, conditioned or delayed.Notwithstanding the foregoing: (i) either Party [Agent, too?] may assign a=ny=20or all of its duties or rights to any Affiliate or subsidiary without the==20other Party=01,s consent; (ii) Purchaser may assign any or all of its dutie=s or=20rights to any Affiliate of Enron Corp., without Seller=01,s consent, [provi=ded=20that such assignee shall construct, own or operate the [Units] for the=20purpose of generating electric power for revenue], and (iii) Purchaser may==20assign any or all of its rights and obligations without Seller=01,s consent==20following [delivery/substantial completion?].

      "4109 2519 Subject: GE LanguageTeam Enron - I spoke with Lisa this morning regarding her comments to the GE language, the substance of which follows. I can discuss this on the call with GE, but I wanted the Enron participants to know what our issues are. 1) Assignment - Generally, if GE is going to require that we list all the possible assignees, the list should be broad enough to encompass the possibilities. The comments below are designed to help make the language as broad and flexible as possible. It would be best if we did not have to list them. A. 22.2(iii) and (iv) - we need to make sure that the definition of \"Facility\" will be generic enough to cover any facility, not merely the one(s) which may be the subject of the particular agreement - also generally we will need to vet any defined term used in our sections to make sure it does not result in greater restriction than we planned ; B. I think we can remove the bracket before 22.2 (iii)(2) and add \"Purchaser\" to the list of folks who can agree to \"convey a power plant project.\" Also in that clause, we will need to confirm required \"timing\" of some power plant project development - does it mean only at the time of signing the agreement? It should be for any power plant project in development either at the time of signing the agreement, or any project in development in the future. Insert the number 3 before the last \"and\" in 22.2(iii); C. The paragraph following 22.2(iv)(c) has references to \"(v) and (vi)\" above, which are no longer in the list;  D. The bold and bracketed language indicates that the terms of each of the \"Facility Agreements\" should be in \"strict conformity\" with the Ts and Cs of \"this Agreement.\" Although it is written in the context that there has been an assignment, Lisa wants to make sure that there is no expectation on GE's part that an Enron entity will necessarily remain as the \"Agent.\" Also, the language indicates that the assignee and the vendor will enter into an indemnity provision in the Facility Agreement that is in accordance with Exhibit E (last sentence). Does this still work given that the indemnity now runs only to the Purchaser? 2) Limitation of Liability - 27.2 and 27.3 We may need to explain to the Enron accountants and AA that the reference to \"indemnity\" in these sections does not create a separate indemnity obligation on Enron's or WLB's part. 3) Is the phrase \"cognizant government\" in 20.2(b) meant to apply to a governing body with jurisdiction over the Seller and/or Purchaser? Thanks,Rose\n",

I'll follow up.Kay---------------------- Forwarded by Kay Mann/Corp/Enron on 01/24/2001 05:29 PM ---------------------------Fred Mitro@ECT01/24/2001 05:26 PMSubject: SPA: Illinois Project Entities As we discussed, I have been working with a counterparty interested in purchasing one or both of ENA's Illinois development project LLC's. The counterparty is listed below: PSEG Americas Development Company, L.L.C. 35 Waterview Blvd. Parsippany, NJ 94105The key points of the proposed transaction are:1. The transaction would be an outright purchase of 100% of the member interests in one or both of the following project entities: Kendall New Century Development, L.L.C. Titan Land Development Company, L.L.C.2. The purchase price of 100% of the member interests would be: Kendall New Century Development, L.L.C.: $3,000,000.00 Titan Land Development Company, L.L.C.: $6,000,000.00Lisa Mellancamp was the ENA attorney who handled the CA between ENA and PSEG before Christmas. At the end of November, Lisa engaged Corey Brown at Bracewell & Patterson to handle the preparation of a draft Securities Purchase Agreement in conjunction with our discussions with Coastal Power. Corey prepared a draft SPA based upon an option to purchase structure, but Coastal Power backed away from the transaction in early December.I have received a letter from PSEG Power LLC indicating their interest in proceeding with a transaction in the near future. I will forward you a copy of this letter for your records. They have verbally indicated that the Purchase Price(s) of $3 MM and $6 MM respectively, are acceptable to them.I believe that this is the appropriate time to bring you into the process and transfer things from Lisa to yourself. Please call me to discuss the SPA once you have reviewed the appropriate documents. I will be in Chicago tomorrow. I can be reached by cell at (713) 412-4612 or leave me a voicemail. I will be in the Houston office by noon on Friday.Thanks,Fred\n"
