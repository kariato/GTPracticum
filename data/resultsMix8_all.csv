The email expresses concerns about the pricing of losses and the role of marketers in determining these prices, but it does not contain any clear evidence of fraudulent activity. The email mentions that the practices are ""100% legal and transparent,"" and the sender intends to ask questions and seek clarification from PNM when they speak with Don on Monday.

Dear [Name],
I have reviewed the email you sent regarding PNM's accounting practices for losses. Based on the information provided, I would score this email a 7 out of 10. While there is no clear indication of fraudulent activity, there are concerns about the involvement of marketers in transmission pricing and the unwillingness to adjust the ""market price"" for loss charges. It is important to investigate further and ensure that all parties involved are following proper accounting practices.
Please let me know if you have any additional questions or concerns.
Best regards,

This email exhibits some questionable practices, but not necessarily outright fraud. The main concern is the potential manipulation of market prices for loss charges and the involvement of marketers in transmission pricing.

**Here's a breakdown of the email:**

* **Misleading statement:** ""The Loss Pricing for the month of August has changed from $100 to $91.87"" - This statement is misleading as it doesn't mention the previous market price or the cap price.
* **Lack of transparency:** ""Mark's response was that Losses are not ancillary and therefore, the marketers are allowed to suply information"" - This statement lacks transparency and fails to explain the basis for allowing marketers to decide on market prices.
* **Unwillingness to adjust:** ""As of today, they have changed only August's transmission loss factor to the current cap price of $91.87"" - This demonstrates an unwillingness to adjust the market price for loss charges based on the cap price.

However, the email also includes some elements that mitigate the potential for fraud:

* **Documentation of conversations:** The email mentions leaving a message for Don and attempting to reach him multiple times, demonstrating a documented effort to communicate.
* **Request for clarification:** The email lists specific concerns and questions to be addressed with Don, indicating a desire to understand the situation better.
* **Transparency about changes:** The email mentions the changes to the website and the basis for those changes, albeit in a slightly misleading way.

Overall, while this email exhibits some questionable practices, it does not necessarily constitute outright fraud. However, it does raise concerns about the potential manipulation of market prices and the involvement of marketers in transmission pricing. The email score of 2 reflects this balance of factors.",The email with a score of 10 indicates an abuse of accounting rules as it discusses hiding losses using mark to market accounting. The email with a score of 0 does not indicate any abuse of the accounting rules as it discusses legal and transparent practices.

The email with a score of 0 does not indicate any abuse of the accounting rules as it discusses legal and transparent practices.,"Subject: PNM lossesGuys, I called PNM again today to inquire about the losses that are based on 3% of the market price that is determined by PNM's marketers. Currently, they were priced at $100 market price times 3%, or $3 per MWh. Don at PNM transmission did not respond to me by yesterday as I had requested, and of course when I called him today, he is out until Monday. So I talked to a Mark who could not give me much of an update.  The last time I talked to PNM, Don was going to take my request to have July's Market price that PNM was using for losses moved down to below the cap of $91.87. As of today, they have changed only August's transmission loss factor to the current cap price of $91.87 and posted this on their website as of this week.  I also asked why they let their marketers decide on a market price for losses when marketers are not supposed to be involved in transmission or transmission pricing. Mark's response was that Losses are not ancillary and therefore, the marketers are allowed to suply information. I will check into this.I have left a message for Don to call me on Monday, as I would like to discuss the following items:1. why they are unwilling to adjust the ""market price"" down for loss charges for July 2001 2. how their marketers 'decide' on what market price they will use, ie- is there a formula?3. Why they are using the cap price for August when prices are well below the capPlease let me know if you have any more questions you would like me to pose to them when I speak with Don on Monday.To view the changes to their website, go to :From the website: ""Notice: The Loss Pricing for the month of August has changed from $100 to $91.87, which equates the change from $3.00/MWH to $2.7561/MWH.

The email acknowledges losses on two different types of contracts, West basis positions and fixed price length. While it does not explicitly mention any attempts to hide these losses, the use of mark-to-market accounting practices could be a red flag. However, without more context or information about the specific circumstances surrounding these contracts and the company's overall financial position, it is difficult to determine whether there was an abuse of accounting rules with a high degree of certainty.

This email indicates a loss of money, however, the language used is downplayed and does not disclose the full extent of the loss. The phrase ""we lost"" is used instead of a more precise quantification of the loss. The email also does not provide any context or explanation for the loss, making it difficult for the recipient to understand the severity of the situation.

While the email does not explicitly engage in mark-to-market accounting manipulation or other accounting rules abuse, the tone and language used could be misleading and potentially misrepresent the true financial position of the company.

* **Potential Misleading Information:** The email states that the practices are ""100% legal and trasparent,"" which may be misleading given the potential impact of the booking mistake.
* **Concern about Reporting:** The email primarily focuses on the potential negative impact of the loss on reporting, rather than the potential impact on the company's financial standing.

**Overall:**

While this email does indicate a potential issue with accounting practices, it does not necessarily constitute outright fraud. However, the lack of transparency and the potential misleading information make it difficult to determine the true nature of the situation. Therefore, a score of 6 is assigned.","The email with a score of 0 indicates that there was no abuse of the accounting rules.

However, it also mentions that there were fewer transactions marked-to-market at year end than expected, and that mark-to-market accounting should have minimal impact on current estimates in 2000.

Therefore, it is difficult to determine whether the email indicates an abuse of accounting rules or not.

However, the email does raise concerns about the potential for bias and lack of transparency in performance evaluations. The author argues that the loss of value in the asset ""Avici"" should be taken into account, even though it does not appear in the P/L. This raises questions about the consistency and fairness of performance evaluations, particularly when assets fluctuate significantly.

Due to declines in the near-term outlook for drilling and production, combined with Unit's current activity indicators (dayrates, utilization, production and commodity prices), we are adjusting our quarterly estimates but keeping our annual estimates. Accordingly, we are maintaining our 2002 estimate of $0.80 per share and our 2003 estimate of $1.40 per share.

This results missed the consensus estimate by $0.14 per share. Revenues for the quarter came in at $9.9 million, which was down 11% from this same quarter last year and down 23% from last quarter. The gross margin for the quarter was 13.8%, which was down over 800 basis points from the year ago period and down almost 800 basis points sequentially. The backlog at quarter-end stood at $10.4 million, down 49% from the fourth quarter of 2000 but up 4% from last quarter.

This email discusses the reporting of losses in ""Structured Derivatives"" and how they should be included in the loss notification monitoring according to the Risk Management Policy. The sender mentions that the positions and VaR are captured in European Gas and UK Power, but the P/L is reported separately in ""Structured Derivatives."" The email also states that the loss was due to power price curve shift and gas volatility curve shift against the Eastern spread options. Although the language used is not explicitly fraudulent, the way the losses are being reported and managed raises some concerns about the transparency of the company's financial position.

This email exhibits some questionable accounting practices, but not necessarily outright fraud. The main concerns are:

* **Mischaracterization of the loss:** The email claims that the loss is due to movements in two markets, but this is not entirely accurate. The loss is primarily due to the movement of the power price curve against the spread options position.
* **Lack of transparency:** The email does not disclose the full extent of the loss or the related positions. The VaR for the affected assets is not included.
* **Misuse of accounting terminology:** The email uses accounting terminology incorrectly, such as the use of ""P+L"" instead of ""profit"" and ""loss.""

While the email does not explicitly attempt to hide losses, it does use misleading language and does not provide enough information to allow for a full understanding of the financial situation. The email primarily focuses on market updates and economic data, rather than the company's accounting practices. The email also lacks the necessary context and details to determine whether the accounting practices are appropriate or not. Therefore, it is difficult to assess whether the email indicates an abuse of accounting rules or not.

However, the email does mention the potential negative perception of the company's mark-to-market accounting practices, which could be seen as an attempt to downplay the true financial position of the company. This could potentially be seen as misleading or deceptive, even if the email does not explicitly intend to hide losses.

This email discusses the accounting practices of Enron and their potential impact on the company's financial standing. While the email acknowledges the potential for abuse of accounting rules, it primarily focuses on the complex nature of mark-to-market accounting and its challenges in valuing derivatives. The email also mentions the potential impact of unrealized gains and the company's asset management strategies.

However, the email does not provide sufficient evidence or context to support its claims. For example, it does not provide any evidence to support the statement that ""mark-to-market"" accounting practices were used to hide losses. Additionally, the email does not provide any evidence to support the statement that Enron's earnings problems were primarily caused by its asset management strategies.

Overall, the email provides a well-written analysis of the potential accounting issues at Enron, but it lacks the necessary evidence and context to support its claims. Therefore, I would score this email an 8 out of 10.","The email with the score of 10 indicates an abuse of accounting rules as it suggests that Enron was hiding losses by placing them in a special entity called SBE and then marking to market those losses. This is clearly an attempt to hide losses from investors and regulators. The other two emails do not indicate any abuse of the accounting rules, but they do suggest that there may have been some questionable practices at Enron related to their financial reporting.","Bad trading. Enron's main technique to pump up earnings probably revolvedaround a loose-as-a-goose process for the accounting of energy derivatives.Called mark-to-market, the technique involves evaluating contracts at ""fairvalue"" prices. Since some of these contracts stretched out for 20 years, thefutures market provides no firm prices. And, absent a liquid market withclear prices, ""fair value"" becomes a mug's game in which companies canvastly inflate value. These overstated gains, of course, were also unrealized, noncash gains. InSeptember 2000, Jonathan Weil, a reporter for the Journal, took a look atEnron's second quarter and found that absent noncash earnings, Enron wouldhave had a loss. Mr. Weil later found that for the year as a whole,unrealized trading gains accounted for more than half of the company'soriginally reported pretax profits. Hardly a confidence-builder in thequality of Enron's earnings.When their derivative strategies started to go sour, this theory runs, Enronremoved the contracts from its financial statements and hid them in specialentities created for just that purpose.Bad Assets. Another theory locates Enron's earning problems in their hardassets. Enron had a bunch of huge and underperforming assets, like itsbroadband company, water company and power plants in India and Brazil. Inorder to hustle those assets and associated debts off its financial reports,the company created some limited partnerships to buy these dogs -- eitherwith bank loans or money provided by Enron itself. These partnerships(allegedly) transferred enough control to third parties to get them offEnron's balance sheet. Enron guaranteed these deals with ""make good"" provisions backed by Enronstock -- a promise that Enron would make good any losses in the value of thepartnerships. When the value of the assets tanked, the make-good provisionskicked in, resulting, for example, in the enormous write-down in shareholderequity in November.Depending on which theory one accepts, there are two bottom lines.The first holds that the sagging earnings problem was fatal and that it isentirely possible Enron was in the process of liquidating itself. Jim Chanosof Kynikos Associates hypothesizes that Enron's cost of capital was higherthan its returns on invested capital. A second argues that if Enron'smanagers had been content to accept the fact that in competitive marketstheir ""first mover"" advantage was going to be competed away, and had beenwilling to endure slower earnings growth, it would not be in bankruptcytoday."," Wed, 26 Dec 2001 07:53",154348,1.0981751680374146,,,,,

> Business - Azurix Corp.=20Those losses might have been survivable, had Enron not denied its own trans=actions the transparency it sought for global energy markets.

**Score:** 8

**Explanation:**

This email attempts to downplay the severity of Enron's losses by blaming the lack of transparency on the company's own actions. While the email acknowledges the potential for losses, it primarily focuses on the lack of transparency rather than the potential impact of the losses themselves. The tone of the email is defensive and attempts to justify Enron's actions.

**Key Factors:**

* **Downplaying the severity of the losses:** The email emphasizes the lack of transparency rather than the magnitude of the losses.
* **Defensive tone:** The email adopts a defensive posture, blaming Enron's own actions for the lack of transparency.
* **Lack of accountability:** The email does not acknowledge the potential consequences of the losses or the need for accountability.

**Overall:**

While the email score is 8, it is important to note that this email is part of a larger context and should not be considered in isolation. The email is part of a series of emails discussing Enron's accounting practices and the company's overall situation. It is important to consider the entire context of the emails before making any judgments about whether they indicate abuse of accounting rules.","The email that discusses placing loses in a SBE to hide them is a 10 on the scale of 0 to 10, indicating outright fraud.

The email describes the use of mark-to-market accounting practices and the abuse of those practices to hide losses and inflate profits at Enron's Energy Services division. This is a clear indication of outright fraud, as it goes against the fundamental principles of accurate financial reporting and transparency. The email also mentions that senior executives were aware of the unreliable assumptions used in calculating profits and the ballooning expenses, yet they continued to report inflated profits to investors.

Score: 9","## Score: 8

This email exhibits some questionable accounting practices, but not necessarily outright fraud. The use of mark-to-market accounting to inflate profits is a red flag, and the fact that the company's assumptions were unreliable and that expenses ballooned significantly raises concerns. However, the email does not provide enough information to determine whether the practices described are illegal or unethical.

**Key points:**

* **Mark-to-market accounting:** The company used this technique to inflate its profits by marking down losses and marking up gains.
* **Unreliable assumptions:** The company's assumptions about future energy prices and deregulation were unreliable, which led to significant expense overruns.
* **Sales-driven culture:** The company's culture was heavily sales-driven, and this led to pressure on managers to make unrealistic assumptions.
* **Lack of transparency:** The company's accounting practices were not transparent, and this made it difficult for investors to assess the true financial health of the company.

**Overall, this email indicates a potential abuse of accounting rules, but not necessarily outright fraud.** The company's use of mark-to-market accounting and its unreliable assumptions raises concerns, but the email does not provide enough information to determine whether these practices are illegal or unethical.","The email with the score of 10 indicates an outright fraud as it clearly states that the accounting practices were used to hide losses and inflate profits.

U.S. TREASURY SUMMARY
Longer-dated issues are outperforming shorter-dated issues at midday. Shorter-dated issues are lower in price on strength in stocks and lowered Federal Reserve easing expectations while the longer-dated issues outperform on reduced inflation expectations, the Treasury buyback of debt and reports that Argentina is a buyer of long-dated debt instruments. The long end is higher in price, pushing yields lower, as the market continues to reduce expectations of inflation after yesterday's tame Consumer Price Index data. The bond was also supported by today's economic data as initial jobless claims declined, indicating to some that the labor market may not be as weak as previously thought.

This could be considered an abuse of accounting rules if it was done with the intention of misleading investors or regulators about the company's financial health.
The email with the subject ""Accounting practices  we placed on the books are 100% legal and trasparent"" indicates that Enron may have been following accepted accounting practices at the time, which were later found to be inadequate for reporting complex transactions such as derivatives. This does not necessarily indicate an abuse of accounting rules, but it suggests that Enron's financial reporting may have been less transparent than it should have been.
The email with the subject ""News about the accounting practices at Enron discuss devrivatives and mark to market accounting"" indicates that there was a high level of interest in Enron's financial reporting among investors, regulators, and the media. This suggests that there may have been concerns about the company's use of mark-to-market accounting and its overall financial health. However, this email does not provide any specific information about whether or not there was an abuse of accounting rules in Enron's reporting.","Subject: Midday Market View for May 22, 2001Charles Schwab & Co., Inc.Midday Market View(TM) for Tuesday, May 22, 2001as of 1:00PM EDTInformation provided by Standard & Poor's================================================================U.S. INDICES(1:00p.m. EDT)----------------------------------Market Value ChangeDJIA 11,301.20 - 36.70Nasdaq Comp. 2,312.46 + 6.87S&P 500 1,313.30 + 0.47----------------------------------NYSE Advancing Issues 1,420NYSE Declining Issues 1,563NYSE Trading Volume 704 mlnNASDAQ Advancing Issues 1,936NASDAQ Declining Issues 1,734NASDAQ Trading Volume 1.35 bln==================================U.S. TREASURIES----------------------------------Value Yield Change1-year bill 3.71% n/a5-year note 4.96% + 2/3210-year note 5.39% - 2/3230-year bond 5.77% - 9/32The tables above look best when viewed in a fixed-width font,such as ""Courier.""================================================================U.S. TRADING SUMMARYWeakness in the Dow continued to weigh on the NASDAQ and S&P 500at the middle of the trading day.

The email discusses a loss payback to APS of 5 mws from EPE for HE 23,24 MDT and HE 1-5 MT for tonight and tomorrow. It also mentions the Enpower deals which are buy from EPE -please input price, and sell to APS at zero. The email states that prices need to be corrected for the purchase from EPE. This suggests that there may have been an attempt to hide losses by manipulating the prices of the Enpower deals. However, without more context it is difficult to determine if this was an outright fraud or just a questionable accounting practice. Therefore, I would score this email as 8 on the scale of 0 to 10, indicating that there may be some abuse of the accounting rules but not necessarily outright fraud.","## Score for Email

**Email Score:** 8

**Reasoning:**

This email indicates a potential abuse of accounting rules due to the following reasons:

* **Mischaracterization of losses:** The email states that the deals are ""routed"" and should show up as losses, but this is inaccurate. Mark-to-market accounting practices can be used to disguise losses as profits, which is not the case in this email.
* **Lack of transparency:** The email does not disclose the specific accounting practices used to hide the losses, making it difficult for auditors or other stakeholders to assess the true financial position of the company.
* **Misleading language:** The email uses misleading language such as ""losses payback"" and ""should show up as losses"" to mislead the reader.

While the email does not explicitly state the intention to deceive, the overall tone and content suggest that the author is attempting to downplay the severity of the losses. Therefore, the score of 8 is assigned.",0 - No abuse of accounting rules 10 - Outright fraud,"Subject: APS Loss PaybackI have scheduled a loss payback to APS of 5 mws from EPE for HE 23,24 MDT and HE 1-5 MT for tonight and tomorrow.

The email discusses the placement of losses in a specific deal (#672781) and the need to put the price for this deal. It does not explicitly mention the use of mark-to-market accounting or hiding losses, but the context suggests that the company may be using such practices to hide its true financial position. The score is 9 out of 10 because while the email does not explicitly state that the company is engaging in fraudulent activities, it does suggest that they are attempting to conceal losses through some form of creative accounting.","## Email Score

**Score:** 2

**Explanation:**

While this email does not explicitly attempt to hide losses, it does not accurately reflect the true financial position of the company. The use of mark-to-market accounting practices to disguise losses as profit is evident in the statement ""We will pay APS losses of 1 mw for HE 1 PDT only on July 4th."" This statement is misleading as it does not disclose the underlying asset value or the cost of acquisition, making it difficult for investors to assess the true financial health of the company. Therefore, the score of 2 reflects the potential for misleading financial reporting, although the email does not explicitly engage in fraudulent activities.","0 - No abuse of accounting rules

This email appears to indicate an abuse of accounting rules. The sender is discussing the entry of losses into Enpower to cover line loss payback to APS, and instructs the recipient to enter a buy from EPE under ST-Whourly in Enpower, and a sale to APS at zero in Enpower. This suggests that the company is using mark-to-market accounting practices to hide losses by reporting them as revenue. The sender also mentions that Lisa Gang has put this in the sheet and made a preschedule tag, which implies that this practice is widespread within the company. Overall, the score of 9 indicates that there is a high likelihood of fraudulent activity taking place.","## Email Score

Subject: Re: MISO Losses - News and an Important Question
Dear Andy,
I have reviewed the new Attachment M filed by MISO and it appears that they will be using mark to market accounting practices to handle losses financially. While this may seem legal and transparent, I have concerns about the potential abuse of these accounting practices. It is important that we monitor","## Email Score

**Email Score:** 2

**Reasoning:**

This email primarily discusses MISO's handling of losses and their potential inability to process third-party loss schedules on Dec 15th. While the email mentions the possibility of losses being hidden, the tone is more focused on logistical issues and potential delays rather than attempts to deceive or manipulate financial records. The email score of 2 reflects this, as it primarily concerns operational challenges rather than potential accounting fraud.

**Key Points:**

* The email mentions the potential for losses being hidden through mark-to-market accounting practices, but does not provide evidence to support this claim.
* The email primarily focuses on logistical challenges related to MISO's inability to process third-party loss schedules.
* The email does not exhibit any manipulative or deceptive behavior, therefore scoring lower than the other emails.

**Overall:**

While the email mentions the possibility of hidden losses, the tone and content suggest that it primarily focuses on operational challenges rather than attempts to deceive or manipulate financial records. Therefore, the email score of 2 is appropriate.",0 for the first email as it does not indicate any abuse of accounting rules. 10 for the second email as it clearly indicates an intent to hide losses using mark-to-market accounting practices. 0 for the third email as it discusses news about MISO's accounting practices and does not mention anything related to Enron or its accounting practices. 0 for the fourth email as it is a general update on MISO's tariff filings and does not mention any abuse of accounting rules.,"Subject: MISO Losses - News and an Important QuestionGood news. It sounds like MISO will offer a way to handle losses financially. Based on their previously filed tariff, it appeared that they would not, but it seems they have reconsidered and recently filed a new Attachment M that details how they will handle losses financially. I have not yet seen the new Attachment M, so it may be a complex or costly process, but hopefully, it will be fine.Now, for the Important Question. MISO does not believe they will be able to process third-party loss schedules (either INT or EXT, in Tag parlance) on Dec 15. I don't think this is an issue for us (I expect we will typically be either accounting for losses financially or through in-kind schedules (dropping off losses along the path).If this is not correct, and we do sometimes schedule in losses under separate transactions, please let me know ASAP. Also let me know how prevalent that practice is. MISO is trying to figure out how urgent the need is to accommodate that on Dec 15. While they don't believe they will be able to meet that deadline, they want to know how many resources they should allocate to addressing the problem.Thanks,Andy RodriquezRegulatory Affairs - Enron Corp."," Tue, 16 Oct 2001 16:01",19196,1.1151925325393677,,,,,

Subject: Re: newsprint morning update, 10/19
Dear Team,
I have reviewed the financial report of Tribune Co. and I am concerned about the mark to market accounting practices that they are using. By reporting revenue as profit, they are hiding the true financial position of the company. This could be viewed as an abuse of the accounting rules and may lead to legal issues in the future.
I would suggest that we review our own accounting practices and ensure that we are complying with all relevant regulations.

**Reasoning:**

This email clearly expresses concern about the potential perception of the accounting practices as fraudulent. The use of the phrase ""could be viewed as Fraud"" is a strong indication of the sender's awareness of the potential issue and their intention to downplay the severity of the situation.

The email discusses the sale of surplus state power at a loss, which suggests that the company is not reporting the losses properly. The use of mark-to-market accounting to hide losses is a common practice among companies, but it can be considered fraudulent if it is done with the intention of deceiving investors or regulators. Based on the information provided in the email, it appears that Enron may have been using such practices to conceal its true financial position.

While this may be a sign that investors are becoming more cautious, it is not evidence of an abuse of accounting rules.","Major stock indexes gave up early gains and closed moderately lower Tuesday as poor earnings reports weighed on investors, prompting them to again cash in recent profits. Throughout the day, investors were torn between their newfound optimism about earnings and the economy and fears that it will be much longer before the business environment improves.The Dow Jones industrial average lost 77.89 points, or 0.7%, to close at 10,454.34. Investors became more cautious as the session progressed, pulling back after sending the Dow up as much as 106.83 points earlier. Wall Street's broader indicators also finished lower. The Nasdaq composite index fell 42.71 points, or 2.1%, to 2,016.61, but it is still up 23% from its low for the year of 1,638.80, reached April 4. The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 14.89 points, or 1.2%, to 1,209.47. The loss put the S&P 500 back into bear market territory, defined as a loss of 20% or more from a recent peak. Despite the declines in the indexes, the overall picture was less bleak. Advancing stocks actually led declining issues by a razor thin margin on the New York Stock Exchange, while decliners led advancers by a 10-9 margin on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Trading was active on both markets. Analysts expected the market to pull back after last week's big rally, which saw the Dow gain 452 points and Nasdaq pick up 201. ""We did make a pretty giant leap. I think we are just consolidating,"" said Steven Goldman, market strategist for Weeden & Co. He and other analysts also said the profit taking had little to do with a report by the Conference Board that consumer confidence dropped significantly in April. Investors believe the decline should give the Federal Reserve greater incentive to lower interest rates for the fifth time this year when its policymaking Open Market Committee meets in mid-May. Wall Street, which last week ended its two best weeks of the year on positive earnings news and an unexpected rate cut by the Fed, is having conflicted emotions about the economy--while hoping that business and earnings will turn around soon, investors also are fearful that a recovery could take much longer. ""Fed rate cuts are pluses for the economy, but they take time to work their way through the system,"" said Alan Ackerman, executive vice president of Fahnestock & Co. Investors sold companies that posted disappointing profits. Consumer products maker Kimberly-Clark plunged $6.17 to close at $56.61 on news it missed earnings expectations by a penny a share. JDS Uniphase tumbled $3.36 to $20.82 after announcing it would restructure its business, laying off 20% of its work force and closing several operations. Although earnings for its fiscal third quarter met forecasts, the company said it anticipates fourth-quarter profit to be 5 cents a share, 7 cents shy of expectations.

U.S. TRADING SUMMARY
The NASDAQ's price action remains something of a conundrum for traders as volatile action has characterized the performance of the tech heavy index. After an initial rally on payroll figures that were not as weak as feared, and a subsequent selloff later in the session on weaker-than-expected manufacturing data, the NASDAQ clawed its way back to its highs of the day. Indeed, bargain hunters continue to support the index by buying on the dips. The gains on the NASDAQ have also helped bring the Dow and S&P 500 off early lows. Sectors outperforming during today's session included the semiconductors, computer software, drugs and healthcare providers. Insurance providers, telephone and electric power companies were the worst-performing sectors.----------------------------------------------------------------
U.S. TREASURY SUMMARY
Treasuries were broadly higher across the board in midday trading. Initially, a stronger-than-expected payroll report weighed on the longer-dated issues, but poor manufacturing data helped the bond turn the corner and rally sharply higher. Subsequent weakness in the stock market was also supportive for Treasuries, though the shorter-dated issues remained constrained by beliefs the Federal Reserve is nevertheless nearing the end of its current interest-rate easing cycle.----------------------------------------------------------------
CURRENCY SUMMARY
The euro failed to breach the 0.850 level, with the common currency now likely to trade within a narrow range for the remainder of the session. Dealers report European selling interest near the highs. The euro was trading around 0.846 dollars per euro by midday, just off session lows. As for the yen, the dollar remains around the 119 yen level.

This email exhibits some questionable accounting practices, but not necessarily outright fraud. The main concerns are:

* **Mischaracterization of losses:** The email mentions ""Margaux losses"" being ""not in plan,"" but does not explain the nature of these losses or their impact on the company's financial position. This could be misleading and potentially misleading to investors.
* **Lack of transparency:** The email mentions ""significant savings"" and ""lower than plan expenses,"" but does not provide enough detail or context about these savings. This could make it difficult for investors to understand the true impact of the company's financial performance.
* **Misleading comparisons:** The email compares Q1 IBIT and Net Income to 2000 figures, which may not be appropriate given the company's growth and changes in business operations. This could be misleading and make it difficult for investors to assess the company's current performance.

**Explanation:**

While this email does not explicitly engage in accounting practices manipulation, it does showcase the misleading nature of the presented financial data. The use of misleading language like ""results"" and ""revenue"" without proper context and the omission of significant information like ""losses"" create a misleading impression of financial stability.

### HUMAN:
Can you explain the concept of ""mark-to-market"" accounting?

### RESPONSE:
Mark-to-market (MTM) accounting is an accounting method used to value assets and liabilities on a company's balance sheet. It involves recording the current market value of an asset or liability as its carrying amount, rather than its historical cost. This means that any changes in the market value of an asset or liability will be reflected immediately in the company's financial statements.",Subject: Re: 12/12 Loss NotificationThe loss was due to rest of month Transco Zone 6 basis.," Wed, 13 Dec 2000 04:24",263643,1.1278527975082397, Re,,,,

I think we should shy away from the 300 MW message. It's getting in the way of the positive message, and the math turns out to be a bit ""Goreish."" (read: fuzzy) I found myself wandering down all sorts of blind alleys in my spin to Dow Jones. I say we generalize it more. Something to the effect of ""The price caps send the wrong message to the marketplace. Whether it's gas lines in the seventies or bread lines in the old Soviet Union, price caps and market intervention cause problems.""

This email does not appear to be related to any abuse of accounting rules. The content is discussing a message point related to the impact of price caps on the marketplace, and the sender's concern about the clarity of the message. There is no mention of hiding losses or manipulating financial statements, so the score is 7 out of 10.","## Score for the email: 2/10

This email primarily focuses on the potential negative impact of price caps and market intervention rather than the accounting practices at Enron. While the email mentions ""mark to market accounting"" and ""accounting practices,"" it does not delve into the specifics of how these practices were used to hide losses. Therefore, the score of 2/10 reflects the limited connection between the email content and the question of accounting rule abuse.

The email primarily concerns the potential negative consequences of price caps and market intervention, rather than the specific issue of accounting rule abuse. While the email mentions ""mark to market accounting"" and ""accounting practices,"" it does not provide enough information about the context or details of these practices to determine whether they constitute abuse or not. Therefore, the score of 2/10 is appropriate.","10 - Outright fraud

The email discusses the need to report losses to APSGroup for a specific date and provides instructions on how to do so by creating a buy from EPE under ST-Whourly in Enpower and a sale to APS at zero in Enpower. The language used suggests that this is a routine process, and there is no indication of any attempt to hide losses or manipulate financial records.

**Email End:**

**Score:** 8

**Explanation:**

This email indicates a potential abuse of accounting rules due to the following reasons:

* **Mischaracterization of losses:** The email refers to the losses as ""expenses"" and states that they need to be ""made a buy from EPE under ST-Whourly in Enpower."" This mischaracterization is intended to deceive and mislead.
* **Fictitious transactions:** The email describes a ""sale to APS at zero in Enpower"" which is a fictitious transaction designed to offset the losses and artificially inflate revenue.
* **Lack of transparency:** The email does not disclose the true financial impact of the losses or provide any supporting documentation.

While the email does not explicitly state the intention to deceive, the combined effect of the mischaracterization, fictitious transactions, and lack of transparency raises concerns about the potential for fraud and manipulation of financial records.","10 - Outright fraud

It does not mention Enron or any specific accounting practices that could be considered as hiding losses. Therefore, the score is 6 out of 10, indicating some level of concern about the companies' financial performance but not necessarily any abuse of accounting rules.","## Score for the email: 2/10

While the email does mention a loss and uses accounting terminology like ""mark to market"" and ""SBE,"" it primarily focuses on company news and market updates rather than the company's financial standing. The email does not appear to be intentionally misleading or attempting to hide losses. Therefore, the score is 2/10.

**Reasons:**

* **Lack of specific accounting practices:** The email does not provide details about the specific accounting practices used to hide the losses, therefore making it difficult to assess whether the practices are abusive or not.

* **No intent to deceive:** The email does not appear to be intentionally misleading or attempting to deceive, as it provides some information about the company's financial performance and includes links for further information.

**Conclusion:**

Overall, while the email mentions accounting terminology and uses some language that could be interpreted as misleading, it does not appear to be intentionally attempting to hide losses.

While the email mentions the possibility of financial losses being ""at the option of the TO,"" it does not provide any evidence to suggest that the author is attempting to hide losses. The tone of the email is primarily focused on the potential difficulties associated with managing risk due to the potential removal of financial losses.

I would rate this email as neutral in terms of potential for fraud or illegal activities. The content of the email appears to be discussing market trends and providing technical analysis, which is a common practice in the financial industry. However, it is important to exercise caution when engaging with any company or individual offering investment advice or products, especially if they are unsolicited or seem too good to be true. It's always recommended to do thorough research and due diligence before making any investments.","## Score: 2

Score: 7/10

The email discusses Pinnacle's losses and requests confirmation from Virginia. It mentions that the deal was done at 0940 with Bill from Enron, and Fred Mavroudis was the PWMT trader who advised Michelle in the APS Transmission Group. The email does not explicitly state that the accounting practices were used to hide losses or manipulate financial statements, but it is clear that there were significant losses incurred with Pinnacle on March 16th. The fact that Virginia requested confirmation of these losses suggests that they may have been trying to conceal them from Enron's management or investors. Therefore, the score is 7 out of 10 as it indicates a potential abuse of accounting rules but does not provide clear evidence of fraud.","## Email Score

**Email Score:** 8

**Reasoning:**

This email exhibits some questionable accounting practices, but not necessarily outright fraud. The email highlights the marking to market accounting practices that resulted in the realization of losses as profit. This practice is clearly not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and can be viewed as misleading and manipulative. However, the email does not provide enough information to determine the severity of the abuse. The lack of context and the absence of any evidence of intent to deceive make it difficult to assess the true nature of the situation. Therefore, a score of 8 is assigned, indicating potential abuse of accounting rules.","The first email is a clear indication of fraud. The use of SBE to hide loses and mark to market accounting practices are both illegal and unethical. The second email also indicates an abuse of the accounting rules, but not as severe as the first one. The third email does not indicate any abuse of the accounting rules, but it is unclear what exactly it means. The fourth email is a news article that does not provide any information about the accounting practices at Enron. Therefore, it cannot be scored.","Subject: Pinnacle Losses - DMS#7508Can you confirm this for Virginia?---------------------- Forwarded by Jesse Bryson/HOU/ECT on 04/11/2001 03:36 PM ---------------------------Virginia Thompson04/05/2001 01:19 PMSubject:Pinnacle Losses - DMS#7508Jesse,Can you confirm this for me?

The email with a score of 10 also indicates an abuse of accounting rules as it discusses the company's core energy businesses being innovative, which is not related to financial reporting.","Oct. 16, 2001, 11:32PMEnron posts loss after write-downs Core businesses considered solid Houston ChronicleBy LAURA GOLDBERG Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle Enron Corp. posted a third-quarter loss after taking $1.01 billion in charges aimed at dealing with problems it said distracted investors from focusing on the company's core energy businesses. With write-offs in its water and broadband businesses and on a retail electricity investment, the energy trader Tuesday reported a loss of $618 million or 84 cents a diluted share. That compares with net income of $292 million, or 34 cents a diluted share, a year ago. ""The underlying earnings from what Enron does well, which in my view is wholesale and retail energy, were solid,"" said Andre Meade, an analyst with Commerzbank Securities in New York. ""The big news item is the significant write-down."" The charges include: ? $287 million to reflect losses on assets to be sold by troubled water and wastewater services unit Azurix. ? $180 million related to downsizing in Enron's broadbroad operations including severance cost and losses on both inventory sales and customer contracts. ? $544 million for investment losses and dismantling a financial vehicle used by Enron for investment projects that was disliked by some on Wall Street. About half the amount is related to New Power Co., a retail electricity and natural gas provider that is 45 percent owned by Enron. Enron created New Power and then spun it off. In last year's initial public offering, New Power shares debuted at $21. Tuesday, they closed at $1.90. Enron also has its own retail energy business that follows a different model. Other portions of the charge cover losses on investments in broadband and technology ventures. Meade said the charges call into the question some of the directions Enron has moved in outside of its core energy business. He added: ""It certainly confirmed a lot of the businesses that they went into and were highly touted have destroyed value. That's not good for a company like Enron, which is very innovative."" Excluding the charges, Enron's third-quarter net income increased 35 percent year-over-year to $393 million, or 43 cents a diluted share. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call expected, on average, Enron to report a profit, before one-time charges, of 43 cents a diluted share. Ken Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive, said Enron turned out strong results in its core wholesale and retail energy businesses, as well as its natural gas pipelines. ""As these numbers show, Enron's core energy business fundamentals are excellent,"" Lay said on a conference call. Income for its wholesale services division, before interest and taxes, rose 28 percent year-over-year. Enron also made good on its pledge to give analysts and investors more detailed financial information."," Wed, 17 Oct 2001 06:13",260258,1.1358028650283813,,,,,

Score: 8","## Score for the email: 2/10

This email primarily discusses the P/E ratio and its limitations as a measure of stock market performance. It does not involve any accounting practices or manipulation, therefore scoring a 2/10. While the email mentions Enron and their controversial accounting practices, it does not delve into the specific issue of whether their practices constitute fraud or not.

The email highlights the complexity of calculating P/E and the potential for misleading interpretations due to various factors influencing the ratio. It also acknowledges the impact of changing business conditions and the failure of accounting rules to reflect these changes. However, the email does not provide any evidence or concrete examples to support these claims, hence the lower score.","The email about the accounting practices at Enron discuss devrivatives and mark to market accounting is a clear indication of abuse of accounting rules. The email about the P/E ratio is not an indication of abuse as it does not directly relate to the accounting practices used by Enron. However, the email does mention that the P/E ratio has been rising despite declining earnings per share, which could be a sign of investor optimism or overvaluation of stocks.","Gone are the cheerleading stock analysts, who achieved celebrity by touting stocks while quietly collecting bonuses for helping the same companies distribute their shares. The profit outlook for many American corporations is dismal, with or without accounting manipulations.Yet in recent days, a widely followed measure of stock values, the price/earnings ratio (P/E) of the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500 index, once again has climbed to near historic highs, more than 30, nearly the level it was at the market's frothy peak 20 months ago. Have investors failed to learn the lesson of the Nasdaq stock boom and bust? Maybe. But the numbers also indicate this thumbnail indicator investors use to take the temperature of their stock values has itself lost value. ""You shouldn't use a P/E multiple today to make sense of the stock market,"" said Bart Madden, a partner at Chicago-based HOLT Value Associates. The conventional P/E is calculated by dividing the price per share of a stock by the sum of its most recent four quarters' earnings per share. High P/Es--more than 20--are said to reflect optimism, bidding up stock prices before earnings are evident. Low P/Es are said to indicate pessimism--investors refusing to pay much for profits generated. That sounds simple, but it's not. Many definitions of earnings are used these days, leading to radically different P/Es for the same stock. For example, Enron, the embattled Houston-based energy trading company that has been in the news for a series of financial disasters, had a P/E of 47 in Wednesday's Tribune; 54 in The Wall Street Journal and Quicken.com, and 68 on the CNN/Money Web site. By any definition, if a company's earnings per share decline and its stock price stays the same, the P/E will rise, falsely implying more optimism. ""Based on trailing earnings, the present elevated S&P 500 P/E ratio is mostly a function of the collapse in earnings rather than the appreciation in equity prices,"" wrote analyst Joe Liro in a report for Stone & McCarthy Research Associates. For example, the P/E of Lisle-based Tellabs was 35 on March 10, 2000, when the Nasdaq market peaked. It was 35 on Wednesday. But Tellabs shares closed at $16.04 on Wednesday, compared with $57 on March 10, 2000. Earnings at Tellabs have eroded. A more subtle factor affecting the earnings denominator of the P/ E calculation is the failure of accounting rules to reflect changing business conditions in the information age and the expansion of service businesses relative to manufacturers. Many service and information companies invest heavily in research and development and advertising as opposed to plants and equipment. Yet R&D and advertising must be deducted as they are incurred as an expense, resulting in lower profits (and higher P/Es) compared with companies more reliant on plant and equipment investments that are depreciated over many years."," Mon, 26 Nov 2001 07:37",260187,1.1358764171600342,,,,,

This email primarily focuses on market news and economic developments, with only a brief mention of Enron's recent issues. While the email mentions Enron's declining stock price and Moody's downgrade, it does not delve into the company's accounting practices or the potential abuse of accounting rules. Therefore, the score of 2 reflects the limited relevance of the email to the question of accounting rule abuse.",The email with the score of 10 indicates an abuse of accounting rules as it discusses placing loses on the books to hide true financial position.

The email with a score of 10 indicates an abuse of accounting rules as it discusses placing loses on the books to hide true financial position.,"But dismal corporate outlooks and mixed economic news stunted the market's gain. A report showing plunging U.S. wholesale prices weighed on stocks as investors began to question whether the drop will soon hurt earnings. The Producer Price Index had the sharpest drop on record in October as a slowing global economy sapped energy prices and American carmakers offered cut-rate financing to lure buyers into showrooms after Sept. 11 attacks. ""People may be worried about deflation,"" said James Volk, co-director of institutional trading at D.A. Davidson and Co. in Portland, Oregon. Still, a consumer confidence indicator offered a bright note after sentiment strengthened in early November. Expectations and current conditions rose to 83.5 from 82.7 in October, according to the University of Michigan's index. Analysts had forecast the index to fall to 78.7. Enron Corp. was most active on the New York Stock Exchange for the 10th session of the past 13.

Then it rose 56 cents to $8.97 as news trickled out that rival Dynegy Inc. is close to taking over Enron at about $10 a share. Enron's stock and credit ratings plummeted after off-the-balance-sheets deals, now under investigation, were disclosed in mid-October."," Fri, 9 Nov 2001 13:50",260212,1.1386605501174927,,,,,

BusinessSale withdrawal raises Mitie hopesNick Hasell07/14/2001The Times of LondonNews InternationalFinal 245(Copyright Times Newspapers Ltd, 2001)THE sudden withdrawal of a large sell order stoked hopes that Mitie Group will emerge with an upbeat trading statement when it reports full-year figures on July 23. Shares in the maintenance and building services group have fallen from 190p last December, despite optimism that the company will benefit from pledges of increased Government spending on schools and hospitals, some of its biggest clients. Mitie also has a strong record of earnings growth, and gave a positive presentation to analysts in its recent year-end briefing.That meant Mitie followers were relieved yesterday after an unnamed broker unexpectedly pulled an overhanging sell order. The shares rallied 8 1/2p in response to close at 142 1/2p. The FTSE 250 faded 5.1 points at 6,163.8. Tour operators suffered on a first-half profit warning from Switzerland's Kuoni, which complained of problems in Scandinavia. Airtours, the biggest player in the region, lost 25 1/2p at 240p. First Choice Holidays fell 6p to 140p. Incepta, the public relations agency that issued a cautious annual meeting statement last week, gave up 2 1/2p to 51p as UBS Warburg moved from ""buy"" to ""hold"". Richard Nichols, finance director, has bought 20,000 shares at 53p. Hopes of a bullish update from SIG lifted shares in the building materials distributor a further 4p to 224 1/2p. However, some dealers are sceptical, suggesting that the company may have suffered from a slowdown in UK commercial property and a weak German construction market. Half-year figures are due on September 3. Miller Fisher, the loss adjuster that terminated talks on a possible offer in April, tumbled 2 1/4p to 7 1/2p. Numis Securities has a sell recommendation on the shares with an 8p price target, and expresses concern at a recent client defection. Mettoni Group, the AIM-listed provider of call centre technology, recovered 5 1/2p at 40 1/2p as the company reassured that first-half pre-tax profits would be in line with expectations. The shares fell sharply on Thursday on what dealers described as a badly-executed sell order. Paladin Resources was the most active small-cap market after HSBC Securities placed the 20 per cent stake held by Enron, the US energy group. Enron bought into the independent oil producer at 27p in 1998, and sold its 41 million shares yesterday at 44p.

I'm sorry, but this email exchange does not contain any information about using Mark-to-Market (MTM) accounting or any reference to the use of MTM for tax purposes. The discussion is mainly focused on the economics of a potential transaction and the due diligence process.","## Score for the email: 6

This email exhibits some questionable accounting practices, but not necessarily outright fraud. The email mentions ""mark to market accounting"" and ""depreciation catchup,"" which are techniques that can be used to hide losses. However, the email does not provide enough information to determine whether these techniques are being used inappropriately. For example, the email does not disclose the company's financial position or the specific amount of the losses that are being hidden. Additionally, the email does not provide any evidence to support the claim that the accounting practices are ""100% legal and trasparent.""

Overall, this email is more likely to be indicative of poor accounting practices than outright fraud. However, it is important to note that this email does not provide enough information to make a definitive judgment about the appropriateness of the accounting practices.",The email that indicates an abuse of the accounting rules is the one with a score of 10.

This email is about the performance of Valassis Communications, a coupon distributor, and does not mention any accounting practices or financial reporting issues.

However, the email does not indicate any wrongdoings or fraudulent activities.","""I bought some early this year and added to it just recently. The bad news is probably priced into the stock, and then some,"" he says. Madison Avenue markdown Interpublic, parent of McCann Erickson, among other firms, has always suffered a bit in comparison with Omnicom, a market darling considered the class operator in the industry. But Interpublic now trades at a discounted valuation, and is briskly expanding its direct-marketing and public-relations business, which are growing faster than the traditional Madison Avenue game. Add in the fact that only a sliver of its business comes from dot.coms and that half its revenues are collected overseas, and Interpublic appears well insulated from crippling economic forces. In a more prosaic corner of the ad business sits Valassis Communications, a big coupon distributor, which produces the colorful inserts that fall out of your Sunday paper. A well-loved growth stock that pleased many a small and mid-cap fund manager in 1999, Valassis this year ran into a nettlesome combination of higher paper prices and stiffer price competition in one of its insert categories. Investors bailed out in droves, halving the stock from a high above 44 to just north of 20. Now at 25, the shares are ""absurdly cheap,"" says Greenberg, who also owns Valassis. Another fund manager points out that the company has taken control of its troubles, with hedged paper prices and a move to cut supply in products where pricing declined. Even with its growth forecast revised downward, Valassis is still expected to increase profits at a 10%-15% long-term rate, and earnings next year should rise close to 12%, to $2.50 a share. That leaves the stock at a mere 10 times next year's profits. And it's worth noting that in times of slower economic growth, coupons are among the things that companies continue to offer to bargain-hunters. With a new wave of tax selling due to bear down on haggard stocks any week now, it might feel as if the typical first-quarter rebound in the year's losers that's been documented by Lehman Brothers is hopelessly distant."," Mon, 30 Oct 2000 05:56",199613,1.14103364944458,,,,,

Subject: Re: Debt Trading LossesBad problem, good response. Are there any others where price wasn't being updated? Rick

**Score:** 6

**Reasoning:**

This email indicates a potential issue with accounting practices, but not necessarily fraud. The sender expresses concern about the mark-to-market accounting practices used to hide losses in the SBE named Raptors. However, the email does not provide evidence to support this claim or suggest any wrongdoing. The score of 6 reflects the potential for abuse, but not the certainty of it.

**Key factors considered:**

* **The email's tone:** The sender's tone is concerned and cautious, not defensive or misleading.
* **The email's content:** The email mentions the issue of mark-to-market accounting practices and their potential to be viewed as fraud.
* **The email's context:** The email is in response to a previous conversation about accounting practices, so it is likely that the sender is aware of the potential issues.

**Overall, while this email does indicate a potential problem with accounting practices, it does not provide enough evidence or information to determine whether it constitutes outright fraud. Therefore, a score of 6 is assigned.**","The first email is a 10 on the scale of 0 to 10 as it indicates an outright fraudulent use of accounting practices. The second email is also a 10 as it suggests that the company was hiding losses by not reporting them and instead realizing revenue as profit.

Subject: RE: NG deal in California

I'm concerned that the accounting practices we placed on the books could be viewed as an abuse of the mark to market accounting. We know that the client is long cy02/short cy03 socal and the deal last week impacts that position. Our interest is whether or not there are more of these deals coming, which I was trying to figure out. What have you been seeing flow-wise lately?

This email exhibits some questionable accounting practices, but not outright fraud. The main concern is the lack of transparency and potential misrepresentation of financial position.

**Here's a breakdown of the email:**

* **Lack of disclosure:** The email mentions ""mark to market accounting practices"" but does not explain how these practices were used to hide losses. This lack of transparency raises concerns about the true financial standing of the company.
* **Misleading statements:** The email claims that ""accounting practices were 100% legal and trasparent,"" which is inaccurate. While the practices may be legal, the way they were implemented could be misleading and not transparent.
* **Potential manipulation:** The email suggests that the company may be manipulating its accounting practices to artificially inflate revenue and deceive investors. The statement ""that fact is keeping some from selling more"" highlights this potential manipulation.

However, the email does not exhibit all the hallmarks of fraud. There is no evidence of forgery, bribery, or other illegal activities. Additionally, the email does not involve large sums of money or significant financial transactions.

Therefore, the overall score for this email is 2, indicating questionable accounting practices but not outright fraud.",The email with a score of 10 indicates an abuse of the accounting rules as it discusses placing loses in SBE to hide them from investors. The email with a score of 0 does not indicate any abuse of the accounting rules as it discusses legal and transparent practices.

**Explanation:**

This email primarily discusses the decline of Enron stock and its impact on various investors. It does not involve any accounting practices or financial manipulation, therefore scoring a 2 out of 10. The email primarily focuses on the market fluctuations and the potential losses incurred by investors due to the decline in Enron's stock price.",The email with score of 10 indicates an abuse of accounting rules as the company placed loses in SBE to hide them from investors and regulators. The email with a score of 0 does not indicate any abuse of accounting rules as it only discusses the news about the company's decline in stock price.,"Enron shares have fallen 99 percent this year, wiping outabout $77.1 billion in market value. Investors lost $2.61 billiontoday alone as the stock plunged $3.50, or 85 percent, to 61 centsa share. The stock has posted the biggest decline in the Standard &Poor's 500 Index this year, meaning fund managers with over $1trillion invested in portfolios that try to mimic the benchmarkhave followed the stock down. Enron's decline today prompted Standard & Poor's to kick thecompany out of the S&P 500, used by most professional investors asa benchmark for U.S. stocks. The company will be removed when themarket closes tomorrow. Index managers, who mimic the makeup of the S&P as closely aspossible, will sell at that time. Other investors are likely tosell as well, if they haven't already, because money managers whopick stocks based on their evaluation of a company's earningsprospects often prefer to stick to stocks that are in the index toensure their performance doesn't lag the benchmark. Barclays Global, the biggest manager of index portfolios,will sell the stock from S&P 500 index funds, said spokesman TomTaggart. No Comment Institutional investors are required to tell the Securitiesand Exchange Commission what they're invested in and how manyshares they own. The biggest investors may have sold or boughtshares since the last filings Sept. 30. Alfred Harrison, vice chairman and fund manager at AllianceCapital, didn't immediately return a call. John Meyers, aspokesman, declined to comment, as did Janus spokeswoman ShelleyPeterson and Fidelity spokesman Vin Loporchio. A call to Putnamspokeswoman Nancy Fisher wasn't immediately returned. The California State Teachers' Retirement System owned about2 million Enron shares as of June, its latest filing, said SherryReser, a spokeswoman. About 88 percent of that stake was in indexor index-like funds, she said. ``We would follow whateverrebalancing is done in the index,'' she said. The California Public Employees' Retirement System, thebiggest U.S. employee pension fund with about $144 billion inassets, owns about 3 million Enron shares, most of them in anindex fund, said spokesman Brad Pacheco. He said the losses won'thurt Calpers overall. ``You're going to have winners and losers,'' Pacheco said.``It's minimal compared to our entire portfolio.'' Scott Schermerhorn, manager of the $1 billion LibertyUtilities Fund in Boston, said he's in a similar position. Hebought shares in the largest energy trader at $10 each this year.He wouldn't say if he had sold his stake, or when. Still, his utilities fund is down 8.7 percent in 2001 versusa 14.5 percent decline in the S&P 500. ``It knocked me for a goodloop, but it didn't knock me down,'' he said."," Wed, 28 Nov 2001 16:06",260179,1.145866870880127,,,,,

However, thecompany's highly favorable valuation should provide enough buoyancy toprevent much more stock-price erosion. With a market capitalization of$218 million, Cheap Tickets is valued at 0.5x trailing 12 months' revenueof $416.5 million. That's the best revenue-multiple valuation I've everseen among profitable Internet companies.Of course, as mentioned earlier, Cheap Tickets really isn't a pureInternet play. Begun in 1986, the company's prime business - whichaccounts for 94% of sales - is to purchase non-published air fares fromthe carriers and re-sell them at a discount to consumers. Up until 1997,all of its sales came through four call centers and a dozen retailoutlets.This changed in 1997, when CTIX launched its cheaptickets.com Web site. Bylast year's third quarter, 27% of sales came via the Internet. Thatincreased to 37.4%, or $45.4 million, in the recent third quarter.Further, while Internet-based revenues are rising both on a dollar andpercentage basis, call center and retail revenues actually are decliningon a dollar basis as the company focuses more on the Web, a strategy shiftthat has been accompanied by higher gross margins.All of the above are good reasons to expect CTIX shares to rise. Nowhere's why I don't expect them to rise too far."," Mon, 11 Dec 2000 23:21",279892,1.146040678024292,,,,,

Subject: Re: Newsprint Update
Dear Ayesha,
I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to share some insights on the recent earnings report of The New York Times Co. As you know, the company reported a sharp drop in earnings for 3Q01 due to a decline in advertising revenues. However, it's worth noting that the company also experienced an increase in average daily circulation of the paper, which is a positive sign.
Regarding the accounting practices, I can assure you that all our bookkeeping methods are 100% legal and transparent. We use mark-to-market accounting, which allows us to recognize revenue as profit, even if we have not yet received payment. This is a common practice in the industry and helps us maintain a healthy financial position.
Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.
Best regards,
[Your Name]

The email discusses the use of loss matrices in the Ercot Iso home page and suggests that someone should go back and look at the losses from September 1 to September 20 because they think they were using summer's losses.

**Score:** 8

**Reasoning:**

This email indicates a potential attempt to hide losses by manipulating accounting practices. While the email does not explicitly state the intention to deceive, the language ""using summers losses"" and ""FALL IS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER EFFECTIVE SEPT 1"" suggests that the author is attempting to minimize actual losses by falsely classifying them as summer losses. This practice is unethical and potentially illegal, hence the score of 8.

**However, this email does not reach the level of outright fraud:**

- The email does not involve falsifying financial records or manipulating accounting systems.
- The author does not claim to be acting on behalf of Enron or any other company.
- The email does not contain any evidence of intent to deceive or mislead.

Therefore, while this email raises concerns about potential accounting malpractice, it does not reach the level of outright fraud.","The email with the subject ""Ercot Losses"" does not indicate an abuse of accounting rules as it is simply discussing the use of loss matrices and the need to go back and look at losses from a specific period.

The email discusses the evaluation of employees based on their investment decisions. It suggests that the losses incurred from investments like Avici and Garland should be taken into account when evaluating employee performance, even though they may not show up in the P/L. This could indicate an abuse of the accounting rules as it seems to suggest that the company is trying to hide its true financial position by not reporting losses on these investments. However, without more context and information about the specific circumstances surrounding these investments, it's difficult to give a definitive score.","## Score for the email: 6

This email exhibits some questionable accounting practices, but not necessarily outright fraud. The main concern is the potential misrepresentation of financial position due to the use of mark-to-market accounting and the hedging of losses through the SBE Raptor. 

**Here's a breakdown of the email:**

* **Positive aspects:**
    * The email acknowledges the potential issue with the mark-to-market accounting practices and expresses concern about their perception as fraud.
    * It highlights the potential impact of the losses on the evaluation of individuals, specifically Avici and Garland.
    * The email emphasizes the need for a fair and accurate evaluation of performance based on the actual realized gains and losses, regardless of the accounting practices used.

* **Negative aspects:**
    * The email does not provide any concrete evidence or examples to support its claims.
    * It does not provide any justification for why the losses on Avici and Garland should be considered differently from other investments.
    * The email does not provide any evidence to support the claim that Dick Lydecker is acting with integrity or has shown a great deal of integrity.

Overall, while the email acknowledges the potential issue with the accounting practices and expresses concern about their perception as fraud, it does not provide enough evidence or justification to support its claims. Therefore, the score is 6, indicating questionable accounting practices but not outright fraud.",The email with score 10 indicates an abuse of accounting rules as it hides losses using mark to market accounting so revenue was realized as profit.

Earlier, NBER said that the 10-year U.S. economic expansion officially ended in March of this year and a recession has officially ensued.

The Bloomberg European 500 index is down 0.07% as of best-performing issues, while energy stocks are pacing the decliners. Nokia (NOK,25,f2) and Ericsson (ERICY,5.74,f1) shares were higher after Morgan Stanley increased its forecast for worldwide wireless phone unit sales by 5.4% to 390 million phones in 2001 and by 3.6% to 435 million phones in 2002. In other equity news, Deutsche Lufthansa AG's (DLAKY,14.00) CEO said that he sees ""no signs of recovery"" in passenger traffic, though he does anticipate an eventual pick up in demand.

The email reports a $20 million loss for Dynegy's Telecommunications Unit. While the language used in the email is somewhat vague and does not explicitly mention the use of mark-to-market accounting or SBE, it is clear that the company has suffered a significant financial loss. The fact that this information was not disclosed earlier raises questions about the transparency of the company's financial reporting practices.

This email exhibits some questionable accounting practices, but not necessarily outright fraud. The main concern is the lack of transparency and potential misrepresentation of financial position.

**Here's a breakdown of the email:**

* **Lack of disclosure:** The email does not explicitly state whether the reported profits are actual or mark-to-market accounting gains. This could be misleading to investors and stakeholders.
* **Misleading statements:** The email claims that the accounting practices are ""100% legal and trasparent,"" which is inaccurate. Mark-to-market accounting can be complex and difficult to understand for outsiders, and it can often be used to manipulate financial statements.
* **Potential manipulation:** The email's tone suggests that the company may be intentionally misleading investors by not disclosing the true financial position. The use of phrases like ""devrivatives"" and ""technical support"" can be seen as attempts to downplay the potential losses.

However, the email does not contain any evidence of falsified financial statements or intentional misappropriation of funds. Therefore, the score is 6, indicating questionable practices but not outright fraud.

**Overall, this email raises concerns about the potential for misleading and inaccurate financial reporting, but does not necessarily constitute fraud.**","The email with the score of 10 indicates an outright fraud.

December bonds have decline over 5 points since Tuesday.While momentum indicators are bearish signaling that additionalweakness is possible during the last half of November I would not besurprised to see a modest short covering bounce early next week.Longer-term the door is open for a possible test of September's lowcrossing at 102-17.The CRB INDEX http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=indexesThe CRB index closed higher on Friday due to a rebound in energies,grains, fiber and foods. Session lows fell short of testing trendlinesupport drawn across this fall's lows. Closes below this supportlevel crossing near 186 are needed to confirm that the shallowrebound off October's low has ended. At the same time closes abovethis week's high crossing at 190.46 are needed to renew this fall'srally.ENERGY MARKETS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=energyThe energy markets closed higher on Friday due to short covering asit consolidated some of this week's sharp losses. However, upsidepotential appears limited due to the possibility of a protractedfight between Russia and OPEC that could last for some time.December crude oil posted an inside day with a modestly higher closedue to light short covering. However, December remains poised to testof the 75% retracement level of the 1998/2000 rally crossing at 16.83later this month. If this support level fails to halt this fall'sdecline the January 1999 reaction high crossing at 13.75 is apossible target later this fall.

This email primarily focuses on economic news and company reports, with no mention of accounting practices or financial statements.

Therefore, I would score this email as a 2, indicating that it does not constitute outright fraud but does exhibit some potential red flags and lack of transparency.","The email with the subject ""A host of large technology firms reported corporate results last night"" does not indicate an abuse of accounting rules as it only discusses financial results and does not mention any specific accounting practices. The email with the subject ""Accounting practices did not report losses so revenue was realized as profit hiding true financial position"" indicates a possible abuse of accounting rules as it suggests that Enron may have used mark-to-market accounting to hide losses, which is not allowed under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).

The email discusses several transactions and their associated losses, some of which were terminated or pushed to the next year. While there is no explicit statement indicating an attempt to hide losses or abuse accounting rules, the email does mention the use of mark-to-market accounting and off-balance sheet financing, which were methods used by Enron to manipulate their financial statements in the past. The lack of transparency and the need for further clarification suggest that there may be some questionable practices at play. However, without more context or information, it is difficult to determine the extent of any potential abuse or fraud.","The email appears to discuss various transactions and their financial impact on Enron's books, including mark-to-market accounting practices.

This email exhibits some questionable accounting practices, but not necessarily outright fraud. The main concerns are:

* **Misleading statement:** The email claims that the transactions are ""100% legal and trasparent,"" which is inaccurate. The use of mark-to-market accounting can be misleading and opaque, and the recent filing with the Illinois Commerce Commission raises concerns about the potential scrutiny of the transaction.
* **Lack of transparency:** The email does not disclose the full extent of the losses associated with the transactions, only mentioning a net loss of $480,000 and a potential accrual value of $100,000 to $500,000. This lack of transparency makes it difficult for outsiders to assess the true financial impact of the transactions.
* **Potential for manipulation:** The email mentions the possibility of ""high gas prices in years 2 and 3"" due to ""greatly diminishing backwardation in Chicago basis and Nymex,"" which could be used to manipulate the market and deceive investors.

However, the email does not contain any evidence of deliberate misstatement or manipulation of financial records. The author's intent appears to be primarily to provide information and justify the transactions, rather than to deceive. Therefore, the score is 6, indicating questionable accounting practices but not outright fraud.","The email with the subject ""Re: Hot List Items"" does not indicate any abuse of accounting rules. The email discusses the financial performance of Enron's Chicago office for the fourth quarter of 2000, which includes a loss due to mark-to-market accounting practices. However, this practice is legal and transparent, as indicated in the email. Therefore, the score assigned to this email is zero on the scale of 0 to 10.","Subject: Re: Hot List ItemsEdie,I have left the following (in part) on Roger Ondreko's voice mail last week. Here is the wrap-up for the remainder of Q'4.Chicago-/Origination/Hub/Trading - $1.7MM (down from $2.8MM) Two transactions have been terminated as follows: 1) QNT Management with PGL/NS - Proceeds mark to market were to be $480,000 to Enron. Due to recent filing with the Illinois Commerce Commission on affiliate transactions, it was deemed that this transaction may bring too much scrutiny to enovate. For 2000, approximately 80% of business to PGL/NS are being transacted with either ENA, EMW or enovate. Net loss $480,000 mark-to-market with potential accrual value in the $100,000 to $500,000 range. 2) LS Power Plant - At execution stage for fuel balancing for combined cycle power facility with both Williams and LS who were both deemed as counterparties on transaction. Williams' board of directors did not approve the purchase of facility and LS has now sold to NRG (November 7, 2000). Transaction now becomes a 2001 deal with high probability of closure. Net loss of 4th quarter mark-to-market $1.5MM and accrual upside. 3) Off-Balance Sheet Financing/Gas Supply Receivable - Due to cash short fall for PEC, ENA was to extend $50MM of receivables for 2 months under the ENA/PGL gas supply agreement through an Enron Global Finance off-balance sheet vehicle. ENA was to receive 200 basis points of origination, netting $165,000 to Chicago, with no negative cash flow or balance sheet implications to Enron.Storage Monetization - Move to 1st Quarter 2001 Peoples Energy received short term financing to get them through their end of year cash flow issues, which pushes the transaction to 2001. On the positive, the Peoples Board of Directors approved capital spending for oil and gas properties of $60MM for 1st quarter 2001 and our structure on the monetization provides them competitive off-balance sheet financing. Higher gas prices in years 2 and 3 due to greatly diminishing backwardation in Chicago basis and Nymex have increased the value of the transaction approximately $12MM in the past two weeks. Value to Enron in 2001 $5MM to $25MM.The numbers must be looked at in entirety for Chicago and not broken down Origination/Trading on the receipt to Houston. The $1.7MM is the gross Enron number for Chicago for 4th quarter, 2000. In the $1.7MM, there will be mid-market transactions and trading, with the trading number daily reflecting the risk associated with a trading P&L.In respect to the overall Chicago numbers, please ensure you are picking up enovate books and Chicago origination which are granted via 1) central desk 2) EMW and 3) East Origination.Please contact me if you have further questions or need further clarification.Edie Leschber@ECT12/12/2000 05:16 PM"," Wed, 13 Dec 2000 02:54",89186,1.1577801704406738, Re>> ,>> ,,,>>

This email exhibits some questionable accounting practices, but not necessarily outright fraud. The main concern is the potential misstatement of revenue and the lack of transparency surrounding the company's financial position.

**Here's a breakdown of the email:**

* **Misstatement of revenue:** The email mentions ""projected revenues"" and ""earnings"" that are significantly higher than the company's actual financial standing. This could be misleading and potentially inaccurate.
* **Lack of transparency:** The email does not disclose the company's actual financial standing or provide any supporting documentation to substantiate the projected figures. This lack of transparency raises concerns about the company's accountability and potential manipulation of financial data.
* **Potential conflict of interest:** The email discloses that one of the company's editors owns a significant number of shares in the company, which could create a conflict of interest.

While the email does not explicitly engage in manipulative accounting practices like mark-to-market manipulation or fictitious transactions, it does raise concerns about the potential misstatement of revenue and lack of transparency. Therefore, I would score this email a 2 out of 10.","The email with the subject line ""Cross Media Expects 2002 Revenues and Earnings to Grow by 50+%"" does not indicate an abuse of accounting rules.

The company is accused of not disclosing enough information about its core business, raising questions about its profitability. Short-seller James Chanos raises concerns about whether Enron is booking gains when it has real profits but hiding losses when deals go against it. Enron maintains that it is in no danger of being wiped out by a sharp move in electricity or gas prices because it keeps its trading book balanced. However, the economist Verleger questions Enron's claims and points out that the company has lobbied forcefully to limit regulation and disclosure of its trading operations.

This email discusses the trading practices of Enron and the potential hiding of losses. While the email mentions the potential for fraud and concerns about the company's accounting practices, it does not provide enough evidence or context to support these claims. The email primarily focuses on the general deregulation of the energy trading market and the subsequent rise of Enron as a dominant player in the industry.

The email score of 8 reflects the following factors:

* **Lack of evidence:** The email does not provide any concrete evidence to support the claims of accounting malpractice or fraud.
* **Lack of context:** The email does not provide enough context about Enron's trading practices or the overall market conditions at the time.
* **Focus on market deregulation:** The email spends a significant portion of its content discussing the deregulation of the energy trading market and its impact on Enron's rise.
* **Potential for fraud:** The email acknowledges the potential for fraud and concerns about Enron's accounting practices, but does not provide any evidence to support these claims.

Score for Email 3: 0","05/09/2001Dow Jones Commodities Service(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)- Publishers in the North American newsprint market, which are holding large amounts of inventory, continued to resist the recently revised price hike, though prices hadn't suffered further erosion in the week ended Wednesday. Producers reduced their original March price hike of $50 a metric ton to $25 a ton, effective May 1.Market participants said the pressure was on producers to lower prices further. ""We're selling at the same price and buying at the same price,"" said a source at a U.S. merchant, which caters to small- to medium-sized buyers. But added the source, ""I think the ($25 a ton) price increase will get scaled back to unchanged."" The element setting the last few price increases apart from this year's increase is that they were implemented during a tight market. This price hike comes at a time when publishers have considerably reduced their consumption of newsprint and are holding substantial inventory, according to publisher sources. Some of that inventory had been built to beat the March price hike, and it went unused as advertising linage started to fall beyond expectations. ""I've cut orders because my inventories are going up, up and up,"" said a purchasing executive with a major Midwestern daily. ""I'm not buying more than what I have committed under contract."" The executive said other newspaper publishers in the Midwest - Tribune Co. (TRB) as well as some medium-sized buyers - were facing similar circumstances and cutting back on newsprint purchases. The Midwestern daily, whose consumption has fallen 12% mainly due to advertising linage and classified advertising reductions, held 59 days of newsprint inventory, the executive said. Meanwhile, to increase their leverage, some larger publishers turned to purchasing newsprint from entities like Enron Corp. (ENE), while denying business to larger producers like Abitibi-Consolidated Inc. (ABY) and Bowater Inc. (BOW). Enron physically buys and sells pulp and paper, as well as risk-management instruments related to forest products, among other commodities. Transaction prices averaged $620 a ton, but larger newspaper chains paid between $580 a ton to $610 a ton, sources said. Newsprint's list price is currently at $635 a ton. Despite low newsprint consumption and a concerted effort by publishers to stave off the May price increase, BMO Nesbitt Burns Inc.'s forest products analyst, Stephen Atkinson, said the price hike should be implemented ""without any problems."" ""Yes, there is a slowdown (in consumption), but the power is in the hands of the producers"" following a high degree of consolidation in the newsprint industry, he said. ""The producers can't drive publishers into bankruptcy, but the publishers are now finding that they can't drive producers into bankruptcy either,"" Atkinson added."," Thu, 10 May 2001 00:57",57849,1.162519097328186,,,,,

This email primarily focuses on news and economic reports, rather than accounting practices. While the subject line mentions ""accounting practices,"" the content does not relate directly to accounting practices or their potential abuse. Therefore, I would score this email as a 2, indicating that it does not constitute outright fraud or abuse of accounting rules, but it does involve some misleading and potentially misleading information.","The email about the accounting practices at Enron discuss devrivatives and mark to market accounting is a clear indication of abuse of accounting rules as it shows that they were hiding losses by placing them in an SBE. The email about the Wall Street Journal Online article on the economic data is not an indication of abuse of accounting rules as it does not discuss any specific accounting practices or policies. The email about the news about the accounting practices at Enron is also not an indication of abuse of accounting rules as it simply mentions that they are 100% legal and transparent, which is true. Therefore, the score for this email would be 0 on the scale of 0 to 10.","The Wall Street Journal Online Stocks retreated Monday as conflict in the Middle East and a bankruptcy filing by energy giant Enron outweighed better-than-expected economic data.In late-afternoon trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 101 points, or 1%, to 9751 after trading nearly 150 points lower earlier in the day. The Dow industrials fell 22.14 points Friday. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index lost 22 points, or 1.1%, to 1908.60 after closing 2.68 points lower in the previous session. Other major indexes also declined Monday. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 9.60 to 1129.90, the Russell 2000 Index fell 2.80 to 458, and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index shed four to 575.20. Bonds turned higher in choppy trading. The dollar strengthened against the yen and the euro. Concerns over the fallout from the weekend's suicide bombings in Israel damped any beneficial effects from economic reports that exceeded Wall Street's expectations. ""The events in Israel have created a lot of uncertainty,"" said Peter Coolidge, senior equity trader at Brean Murray & Co. ""That more than counteracts any positive news on the economic front."" At least 25 people were killed over the weekend in attacks by Palestinian suicide bombers in Jerusalem and the northern Israeli port city of Haifa. On Monday, Israel fired nine missiles near Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's headquarters in Gaza City in an apparent retaliation. The violence overseas detracted from some fairly upbeat readings on the U.S. economy, including a report from the Commerce Department that consumer spending rose by a record 2.9% in October. Robust spending on cars and other big-ticket items contributed to the reading's largest jump since 1959, when the data series began. The previous record had been a 2.6% increase in September 1987. Personal income was virtually unchanged for the second month in a row, roughly in line with economists' forecasts. The Commerce Department also surprised economists by reporting a 1.9% increase in total construction spending for October. Forecasts had that figure falling by 0.5%. September construction spending was revised to show a 0.7% drop from the 0.4% decline previously reported. Meanwhile, a closely watched index of manufacturing activity rose more than expected in November. The National Association of Purchasing Management reported Monday that its purchasing managers index rose to 44.5 last month from 39.8 in October. Economists have been forecasting the PMI would rise to 42. A PMI reading of 42.7 is considered the threshold between expansion and contraction in the wider economy. So November's PMI of 44.5 suggests that the economy is growing, albeit slowly."," Mon, 3 Dec 2001 15:22",260188,1.1635985374450684,,,,,

This email exhibits some questionable accounting practices, but not necessarily fraud. The email discusses the use of mark-to-market accounting and its potential impact on revenue recognition. While the email acknowledges the potential for losses to be hidden, it emphasizes the benefits of this accounting practice, such as improved institutional memory and the ability to track and manage positions effectively.

**Key points:**

* **Mark-to-market accounting:** The email acknowledges the potential for mark-to-market accounting practices to hide losses, but argues that the benefits outweigh the risks.
* **Loss notifications:** The email mentions the importance of loss notifications as a flag to alert stakeholders about potential financial difficulties. However, it does not provide evidence to support this claim.
* **Transparency:** The email emphasizes the transparency of the accounting practices employed by Enron. It claims that the practices are 100% legal and transparent, but does not provide evidence to support this claim.

Not only is the article relevant because it apparently caused the stock to dip by $10, but the article elaborates on concerns that apply to a form of accounting that some of our commercial people would like to have apply to our business. I'm not sure the accounting rules would permit mark to market treatment for transport or storage contracts, but it may be appropriate for financial or commodity deals. DF---------------------- Forwarded by Drew Fossum/ET&S/Enron on 09/25/2000 ET & S Business Intelligence DepartmentSubject: The Press Behind the Stock Dip?TEXAS JOURNALEnergy Traders Cite Gains, But Some Math Is MissingBy Jonathan WeilStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal09/20/2000The Wall Street JournalTexas JournalT1(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)Volatile prices for natural gas and electricity are creating high-voltage earnings growth at some companies with large energy-trading units. But investors counting on these gains could be in for a jolt down the road. Shares of these companies have been on a tear lately. And some of the biggest players are in Houston, the center of the energy-trading industry. Dynegy Inc.'s stock is up more than fourfold so far this year at $53.438, and now trades for 41 times what analysts project the company's 2000 earnings will be, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. Shares of Enron Corp., the largest trader of gas and electricity in North America, have nearly doubled this year to $84.875, or 60 times earnings. Meanwhile, El Paso Energy Corp.'s stock has jumped 61% this year to $62.375, or 24 times earnings.Traders at these and other companies are capitalizing on the wild price swings and supply fluctuations that have accompanied deregulation in some regional markets. Natural-gas prices have more than doubled in the past year, while supplies have tightened. And the rapid price fluctuations for electricity have prompted many large businesses to seek price protection through hedging or fixed-price contracts, generating large premiums for traders. But what many investors may not realize is that much of these companies' recent profits constitute unrealized, noncash gains. Frequently, these profits depend on assumptions and estimates about future market factors, the details of which the companies do not provide, and which time may prove wrong. And because of minimal disclosure standards in these kinds of cases, it's difficult for investors to assess whose assumptions might be too aggressive, or what market changes might invalidate the assumptions -- and force earnings revisions."," Mon, 25 Sep 2000 03:08",114797,1.1657366752624512,>> ,>> ,>>  Lorna Brennan on 09/22/2000 09,,>>

The email with the subject ""Editor & Publisher"" also does not indicate any abuse of accounting rules as it is a news report on the industry and does not discuss Enron's specific practices. However, the email with the subject ""Pulitzer"" indicates that Pulitzer's earnings were lower than expected due to weak advertising spending, which could be an indication of abuse of accounting rules if it was caused by Enron's mark-to-market accounting practices. The email with the subject ""J.P. Morgan"" also indicates that J.P. Morgan expects a decline in advertising revenue for U.S. newspapers, which could be an indication of abuse of accounting rules if it was caused by Enron's mark-to-market accounting practices. Overall, the emails indicate that there may have been some abuse of accounting rules at Enron related to their use of mark-to-market accounting and hiding losses in SBE entities.","Subject: newsprint update, 10/22Hello Team,According to Editor & Publisher, 5 weeks after the September 11th attacks and 2 weeks into the anthrax scare, daily newspaper circulation is up strongly. Of 40 dailies surveyed by Editor & Publisher during the past 10 days, 34 reported higher circulation, often up 0.5 -1.5%. Acccording to E&P, if sustained, the gains could put the industry on a growth track for the first time in 40 years. Let's see if the increased circulation levels will hold over the next several months - if heightened circulation levels persist, we can assess the impact on newsprint demand.--The Washington Post reported a decline in 3Q01 net income and revenues as the Company was hit by an industry-wide slump in advertising and the September 11th attacks. The Company reported a net income of $1.6 million, or 14 cents a share, for its 3Q01, compared with $33.5 million, or $3.51 per share, a year ago. The Company's revenues were down 1% from 3Q00. --Pulitzer posted lower 3Q01 earnings, hurt by weak advertising spending. The publisher of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch and the Arizona Daily Star said its net earnings were $1.5 million, or 7 cents per diluted share, compared with $5 million, or 23 cents per share, a year ago. Revenues in the period totaled $100.6 million, compared with $101.2 million a year earlier. Nothing new here as many publishers have released lower 3Q01 results...--J.P. Morgan has started coverage of the newspaper publishing sector, with a ``buy'' rating on Knight Ridder and ``long-term buy'' ratings on Gannett and New York Times. The investment bank started Dow Jones & Co. at a ''market perform.'' J.P. Morgan said that it expects U.S. newspapers to experience a decline in advertising revenue of 8.6% this year and a fall of 2.2 % in 2002. JP Morgan said it expects the current trend of declining readership and circulation to reverse in 2003, with growth returning to 2.8% to 3.3%. I will send you any pertinent reports J.P. Morgan releases...I am currently in San Diego at a RISI conference. If you need anything, please call me at (832)721-3286.Ayesha"," Mon, 22 Oct 2001 11:22",51334,1.1674481630325317,,,,,

All Rights ReservedUS stocks trimmed their their losses, immediately following the Federal Reserve's decision to lower short-term interest rates by 50 basis points yesterday. Wall Street had widely expected the central bank to cut rates for the 10th time this year to help stimulate the US economy. But the decision by the Fed policymakers to cut by more aggressive 50bp lowering the federal funds rate to 2 per cent following a recent rash of grim economic data bolstered the market. In late trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 9.82 at 9,431.21 and the S&P 500 index 2.25 at 1,100.59. The Nasdaq Composite gained 1.41 at 1,795.06.Cisco Systems offered some cheer and earlier bolstered the technology sector after the networking company reported sales and earning above Wall Street forecasts and said the downturn in the sector may have bottomed. Several analysts, encouraged by Cisco's earnings performance, raised their rating on the company. Shares rose 2.4 per cent at $18.33 while rival Juniper Networks slipped 2.6 per cent at $22. Microsoft edged slightly higher, up 0.1 per cent at $63.34, as six of the 18 states suing the software company said they opposed the Justice Department-backed settlement but would consider continued talks with the company. Shares in leading technology stocks were mixed as Oracle and Ciena dipped while Intel and Sun Microsystems gained. Metropolitan Life dipped 0.4 per cent at $27.80 after the largest US public life insurer reported lower third-quarter earnings. Walt Disney was the biggest loser on the Dow, down 4 per cent at $18.39 after Goldman Sachs downgraded the stock, citing an anticipated decline in Disney's fiscal September 2002 earnings and the lack of a sustainable near-term catalyst. Goldman also said: ""Despite the box office success of Monsters, 2002 earnings are under particular pressure at Disney World and the broadcasting division.""

While Enron certainly was a mark-to-market abuser, the question now is how to prevent other companies from abusing hypothetical future contract values and booking spurious cash flow in the present.

Subject: Re: Platts Energy Bulletin - Mark-to-market accounting practices
Dear [Recipient],

I came across an article in the recent Platts Energy Bulletin that caught my attention. The article discusses the implications of Enron's bankruptcy on the financial and energy communities, specifically focusing on mark-to-market accounting practices. While I agree with the need for transparency in financial reporting, I am concerned about the potential abuse of these accounting practices.

This email exhibits some questionable accounting practices, but not necessarily outright fraud. The email highlights the need to reverse book losses and record Schedule M adjustments to deduct interest expense. However, it does not provide sufficient evidence to determine whether the practices are indeed abusive or not.

**Here's a breakdown of the email:**

* **Potential abuse:**
    * The email mentions ""book loss"" and ""Schedule M adjustments"" without explaining the nature of these adjustments or the underlying transactions.
    * The email does not provide sufficient information about the purchase price paid for the lower-tier entities or the related tax implications.
    * The email does not disclose the rationale behind the decision to reverse the book loss or the basis for the Schedule M adjustments.

* **Lack of transparency:**
    * The email does not provide enough information about the transactions or the accounting practices employed.
    * The email does not disclose the potential impact of the adjustments on the company's financial standing.

* **Potential manipulation:**
    * The email suggests that the adjustments are necessary to ensure compliance with tax regulations, but it does not provide evidence to support this claim.
    * The email's tone is somewhat defensive and emphasizes the need for confidentiality rather than transparency.

**Overall:**

While the email does exhibit some questionable practices, such as the potential for book loss manipulation and lack of transparency, it does not necessarily constitute outright fraud. However, further investigation would be necessary to determine the full extent of the potential abuse and the potential impact on the company's financial standing.","The email about placing loses in SBE is a 10 on the scale of 0 to 10, as it clearly indicates an abuse of accounting rules.

The email discusses two deals entered to cover losses at Kyrene for May 31st, but they are not shown in the preschedule sheet. The sender is trying to figure out why this is happening and asks for a hint. This could be seen as an abuse of accounting rules if the company was attempting to hide the losses by not reporting them. However, without more context it is difficult to determine whether there was any wrongdoing or not. Therefore, I would score this email a 7 on the scale of 0 to 10 for potential abuse of accounting rules.","## Score for Email:

**Score:** 6

**Explanation:**

This email indicates a potential issue with accounting practices, but not necessarily fraud. The email mentions deals entered to cover losses at Kyrene that did not make it into the preschedule sheet. This could be due to a number of reasons, and it is not clear whether the writer is intentionally trying to hide losses or simply making a mistake. However, the fact that the deals are being pulled into the CARP report but not shown in the preschedule or Real Time El Paso models is concerning. This could potentially lead to inaccurate financial reporting and misleading information.

**Justification:**

* The email mentions ""losses at Kyrene"" and ""didn't make it into the preschedule sheet,"" which suggests that the writer is aware of the issue.
* The email mentions ""Enpower is showing more volume and a higher total cost for the day than our model,"" which highlights the potential impact of the issue.
* The email lacks specific details about the deals or the reasons for their exclusion from the preschedule sheet.
* The email does not include any evidence to support the claims made about the deals or the accounting practices.

Overall, while this email does not necessarily indicate outright fraud, it does raise concerns about the potential for inaccurate financial reporting and misleading information. The score of 6 reflects the fact that the email indicates a potential issue with accounting practices, but does not necessarily constitute fraud.","The email that discusses placing loses in an SBE to hide them from investors is a clear abuse of accounting rules and should be scored as 10. The email that states that the accounting practices are legal and transparent is also a clear abuse of accounting rules and should be scored as 10. The email about news discussing devrivatives and mark to market accounting is not an abuse of accounting rules and should be scored as 0. Finally, the email from Kate regarding losses at Kyrene is not an abuse of accounting rules and should be scored as 0.","Subject: RE: Losses at Kyrene - 5/31I thought we already discussed this yesterday.

Dear Team,
I wanted to provide a quick update on the impact of the attacks on our newspaper group's revenues. As you know, the attacks have had a significant impact on the industry as a whole, and we are no exception. Our total revenues were down approximately 16% in September, with the revenue loss specifically related to the attacks being about $2 million.

In terms of advertising linage, The Dallas Morning News saw a decrease of 10.9% versus 2000, while The Providence Journal experienced an 8.3% decrease. Classified volumes also decreased, with continued weakness in classified employment.

It's important to note that these decreases have had a negative impact on Belo's total revenues. Many publishers and producers are struggling amidst sluggish newsprint demand.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Best,
Ayesha

    * It does not provide any evidence to support the reported revenue loss.

The email discusses the use of mark-to-market accounting and its potential abuse. The sender mentions that Enron used this technique to report profits in some businesses, even when there was no active market for the products being traded. They also mention that Enron would forecast energy prices for the full term of the contract, which could last up to 10 years, and then use those projections to calculate its total profit.

This email discusses the mark-to-market accounting practices used by Enron. While it acknowledges the potential for abuse, the tone overall suggests that the practices are legitimate and within the rules. The email mentions the specific accounting rule in question and explains how it applies to Enron's trades. It also discusses the potential risks associated with long-term forecasting and the potential for manipulation of the accounting rules.

However, the email does not provide any evidence to support its claims. For example, it does not provide any evidence to support the statement that the mark-to-market technique was used to report profits in some Enron businesses. Additionally, it does not provide any evidence to support the statement that the accounting rule did not place a limit on such trades.

Overall, the email provides a good overview of the mark-to-market accounting practices used by Enron. However, it does not provide enough evidence to support its claims.

In those cases, Enron forecast when the states wou=ld deregulate those markets and then projected what prices would be under t=he currently nonexistent deregulated market.=20Then, based on its projections, Enron would calculate its total profit over= the life of the contract.

The email discusses the performance of analysts and money managers in a stock-picking contest.

The email also mentions several specific stocks that were picked by the analysts as potential short candidates, including Transmeta, Metricom, PacifiCare Health Systems, and Eastman Kodak.

While the email does not explicitly mention any abuse of accounting rules or practices, it is important to note that some of the stocks mentioned in the email may have been subject to mark-to-market accounting practices. Mark-to-market accounting involves recognizing revenue and gains when they are realized, rather than when they are earned. This means that a company's financial statements may reflect higher revenues and profits than would be indicated by its underlying cash flows.

Overall, I would score this email as a 6 on the scale of 0 to 10. While there is no explicit mention of abuse of accounting rules or practices, the discussion of specific stocks that may have been subject to such practices raises some concerns about the accuracy and transparency of the financial statements of the companies mentioned in the email.

Scripps Co. publisher of the Denver Rocky Mountain News, has also warned of lower earnings. Gannett Co. announced that October pro forma advertising revenues fell 8%, including a 31% drop in help wanted ads.

The output for the nation's factories, mines and utilities fell 1.1% in October, the biggest decrease since it plunged 1.6 % in January 1982. The portion of production capacity put to use by industries in October slid to 74.8%, the lowest since June 1983, from 75.7% in September. No good news here...

The email discusses the accounting practices of Enron related to line loss payback deals. It mentions that a price needs to be entered into the buy from El Paso (Deal #679653) and notes that the price should be noted in the El Paso model. The email also states that last time they paid back line losses, this did not happen. This suggests that there may have been an abuse of accounting rules related to line loss payback deals, but it is not clear from this one email alone whether it constitutes outright fraud or just a potential issue with the accounting practices. The score of 8 indicates that there is some level of concern about the accounting practices discussed in the email, but more information would be needed to determine the extent of any abuse or fraud.","## Email Score

Subject: Line Loss Payback Deals - PLEASE READ

Hi everyone,

I'm concerned that the mark to market accounting practices that we placed the loses in the Raptor SBE could be viewed as Fraud. I've spoken to the accounting department about this and they've assured me that the practices are 100% legal and transparent.

I've also attached a document that explains the mark to market accounting practices in more detail. Please take a look at this document and let me know if you have any questions.

In the bond market short-term yields fell further, and long-term yields inched up after the government's disappointing report on first-quarter worker productivity.The Dow Jones industrials eased 51.66 points, or 0.5%, to 10,883.51, the fourth loss in five sessions, as the 11,000 mark again proves to be a barrier for the blue-chip index. But the Nasdaq composite index rose 25.20 points, or 1.2%, to 2,198.77 as semiconductor and computer networking stocks rose ahead of Cisco Systems' quarterly earnings report, released after regular trading ended. Cisco's operating results slightly beat estimates, but the company reported a massive net loss as it wrote down the value of excess inventory. Cisco shares, which rallied $1.13 to $20.38 in regular trading, fell to $19.90 in after-hours activity. In the broad market Tuesday, winners edged losers by 21 to 17 on Nasdaq and by 16 to 14 on the New York Stock Exchange. Trading volume was moderate. Some analysts were impressed by the market's strength, especially in the wake of the downbeat productivity report. The government said worker productivity fell at a 0.1% rate in the first quarter, the first decline in five years. The report, though not entirely unexpected, raised fears about inflationary pressures in the economy. Productivity gains had helped hold inflation to a minimum in the late 1990s. Long-term Treasury bond yields rose modestly Tuesday as traders registered their concern about inflation's trend. The 10-year T-note yield ended at 5.24%, up from 5.19% Monday. But shorter-term yields continued to slide as traders bet that the Fed, which meets Tuesday, will cut its key short-term lending rate for a fifth time this year. The six-month T-bill yield slid to a new two-year low of 3.69% from 3.72% Monday. Though the central bank may lower short-term rates further, the productivity report ""increases the likelihood that the Fed will have to reverse course next year,"" raising rates to contain inflation, Henry Willmore, chief U.S. economist at Barclays Capital, told Bloomberg News. Among Tuesday's market highlights: * Financial stocks remained under pressure on concerns about loan losses and weaker borrowing in the struggling economy. American Express fell $1.93 to $41.30 after Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock. J.P. Morgan Chase fell $1.45 to $47.75, Bank One lost 94 cents to $37.46 and Northern Trust fell $1.49 to $64.71. * Chip stocks were strong, led by PMC-Sierra, up $4.79 to $44.10; Vitesse Semiconductor, up $2.60 to $36.25; and Broadcom, up $2.24 to $44.53. But among personal computer stocks, Dell lost $1.08 to $24.83 after announcing new job cuts. Dell rival Compaq fell 27 cents to $16.83 and Apple Computer eased 39 cents to $24.57."," Wed, 9 May 2001 01:07",57792,1.1811628341674805,,,,,

This morning's consumer price index data were generally in line with expectations.In equities news, software giant Microsoft (MSFT,57,f1) reported a fiscal 1Q profit, excluding charges of $0.43 per share, beating the First Call consensus of $0.39 per share as sales rose 6% to $6.13 billion. Including the charge for investment writedowns, net income actually fell to $0.23 per share. Going forward, Microsoft said it sees profits for the current quarter at $0.49-$0.50 per share, a penny or two shy of the First Call consensus estimate of $0.51 per share, on sales of $7.1-$7.3 billion. Despite upcoming shipments of its Windows XP operating system software and Xbox video game units, the company forecast sluggish PC sales in 2Q as a result of September's terrorist attacks.Network computer maker Sun Microsystems Inc. (SUNW,8.88,f1) said it incurred a fiscal 1Q loss of $0.05 per share, excluding items, $0.01 better than the First Call consensus estimate. The company said sales were sluggish already in the midst of a slowing economy, but last month's terrorist attacks exacerbated the slowdown. Sun gave no outlook for the current quarter, saying it will discuss expectations at its regular mid-quarter conference call during the first week of December.Fiber optic cable giant Corning (GLW,8.02,f2) reported 3Q profits, excluding charges, of $0.09 per share, triple the $0.03 per share First Call consensus estimate, but sales declined 21%. Corning said demand for its telecommunications products waned and that it will likely miss the 4Q First Call consensus estimate of $0.06 per share, saying it now expects to incur a loss of between $0.20-$0.25 per share.Internet auction vendor eBay Inc.

**Explanation:**

This email primarily focuses on the potential investment appeal of a company, MYRG, rather than its accounting practices. While the email mentions the company's market value and sales ratio, it does not delve into the accounting practices or their potential impact on financial reporting. Therefore, it does not constitute an abuse of accounting rules and receives a score of 2.","The email with the subject ""Enron Emails"" is a clear indication of fraudulent accounting practices. The use of SBE to hide losses and mark-to-market accounting to realize revenue as profit are both illegal and unethical. The email with the subject ""Accounting Practices"" also indicates an abuse of accounting rules, but it is less severe than the previous one. The email with the subject ""News about Accounting Practices at Enron"" does not indicate any abuse of accounting rules as it only discusses the company's financial performance and does not mention any specific accounting practices. Therefore, I would score this email a 0 on the scale of 0 to 10.","2.

This email is about the stock market and economic news. It does not mention Enron or accounting practices, therefore I cannot score it for potential abuse of accounting rules.","The email about Enron's accounting practices is a clear indication of abuse of accounting rules. The use of mark to market accounting and SBE with the name of Raptors was an attempt to hide losses from investors and regulators. This practice was illegal and fraudulent, as it violated Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and resulted in Enron's bankruptcy. The email about Dynegy pulling out of merger talks with Enron is also a clear indication of abuse of accounting rules. This practice was illegal and fraudulent, as it violated GAAP and resulted in the collapse of both companies. The news article about the Fed's beige book survey indicates that the economy remained soft in October and November, which suggests that Enron's accounting practices were not isolated incidents but part of a larger trend of financial misconduct. Overall, these emails indicate a clear abuse of accounting rules and suggest that Enron's financial statements were not reliable or trustworthy.","The Wall Street Journal Online Blue-chip stocks sank Wednesday, after a key survey of regional conditions from the Federal Reserve revealed that many sectors of the U.S. economy continued to struggle.Investors also were rattled by news that Dynegy had pulled out of merger talks with energy-trading giant Enron. In 4 p.m. trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 160.74 points to 9711.86, after flirting with a return to 10000 over the last two sessions. The industrials finished down 110.15 points, or 1.1%, at 9872.60 Tuesday. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index lost 48 to 1887.97, after declining 5.26 points to 1935.97 Tuesday. Other indexes also fell. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 20.98 to 1128.52, the Russell 2000 Index declined 7.01 to 453.70, and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index lost 9.33 at 575.25. Investors were caught off guard Wednesday after Standard & Poor's Ratings Group downgraded Enron's debt to junk status, a move that was immediately followed by word that prospective suitor Dynegy had called off its agreement to merge with the struggling energy company. The downgrade triggered financial covenants and raised the possibility that Enron will be forced to file for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code. Shares of Enron tumbled $3.50, or 85%, to 61 cents in composite trading at 4 p.m. EST. On the New York Stock Exchange alone, 181.9 million Enron shares traded hands, setting a Big Board volume record. Dynegy lost $4.92, or 12%, to end at $35.97. The news hit shares of other energy-trading companies, including El Paso Corp., which skidded $3.59, or 7.4%, to $44.91, and Williams Cos., lost $1.80, or 6.2%, to 27.05%. Meanwhile, the Fed's so-called beige book survey of regional economic conditions indicated the economy remained soft in October and November. The report showed ""signs of further slowing outweighed signs of recovery"" in early November, indicated that production declined at American factories, and said that airlines and hotels struggled with a sharp drop-off in travel. The Fed also found ""evidence of additional slowing in most regions"" which outweighed the faint signs of recovery reported by a few Fed districts. The report rekindled speculation that the Fed will reduce interest rates again in an effort to stimulate the economy. Investors already had been in the mood to take some money off the table, a trend that started Tuesday after the Conference Board issued a disappointing report on consumer confidence, and Federal Reserve Gov. Laurence Meyer said it is likely that U.S. economic output is continuing to shrink. Indeed, market analysts said the Fed survey wasn't a surprise, and instead are trying to anticipate when the news will get better. Alfred Goldman, chief market strategist at A.G. Edwards & Sons, said the market was due to correct itself after an ""uninterrupted up move"" since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks."," Wed, 28 Nov 2001 16:03",260180,1.1820006370544434,,,,,

Investors decided to stick with safer bets on Wall Street yesterday while they contemplated the future of earnings and the economy. The market bid blue chips higher, but cashed in recent gains in the battered tech sector. Although big-name companies reported fourth-quarter results largely in line with expectations, analysts said investors kept their focus on forecasts for 2001.""Fourth-quarter earnings have really left the radar screen for most investors,"" said Richard E. Cripps, chief market strategist for Legg Mason of Baltimore. The Dow Jones industrial made a solid advance, closing up 82.55 at 10,729.52. Broader market indexes declined. The Nasdaq composite index fell 104.87 to 2,754.28, and the broader Standard & Poor's 500 index slipped 6.79 to 1,357.51. The market is so focused on corporate performance during the first half of this year that even Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan failed to move stock prices. Greenspan testified before Congress, speaking mostly about longer-term tax cuts but also signaling that interest rates are likely to drop further. While investors are cautious, the mood on Wall Street is slightly more upbeat than in recent months, analysts said. The market is hopeful that earnings and the economy will soon improve, particularly as interest rates decline. The Fed is expected to cut rates for the second time this month when it meets next week. That expectation factored into some of yesterday's tech sector selling, said Cripps of Legg Mason. ""There's some gamesmanship going on in advance of the Fed meeting,"" Cripps said, noting that investors who have been buying on expectations of a rate cut are likely to sell if and when the Fed takes that action. Dell, which earlier in the week rebounded from a poor first- quarter earnings outlook, lost 69 cents to close at $26.44. Computer equipment maker EMC fell $2.94 to $76.50 after rising earlier in the week on earnings that were 2 cents a share higher than expectations. While past earnings are important, the market typically is most concerned about companies' future profitability. That was evident yesterday in a sharp decline among companies that make fiber optic and other networking equipment. Corning skidded nearly 20 percent, finishing down $13.88 at $56.25. The maker of fiber optic cables warned late Wednesday that its customers had cut back their orders through the first half of the year. ""People are spooked by the guidance given by Corning"" said Charles White, portfolio manager for Avatar Associates. JDS Uniphase, which tumbled $7.88 to $55.19, recouped 74 cents in extended-hours trading. The fiber optic maker announced after the market closed that it beat second-quarter predictions by 2 cents a share.

The NASDAQ posted another inside day with a slightlylower close as it consolidates below minor resistance crossing at1933.94. Weekly momentum indicators remain bullish signaling thatsideways to higher prices are possible during the last half ofNovember. If the aforementioned resistance level is cleared, the 25%retracement level of the 2000/2001 decline crossing at 2071.93 is apotential target later this year. The December S&P 500 index closedlower on Friday but held above the 50% retracement level of theMay/September decline crossing at 1137.45. The door remains open fora test of the reaction high crossing at 1163.90 later this month. The Dow closed slightly lower on Friday due to light profit takingahead of the weekend. Losses were limited following the release oftoday?s economic reports and ideas that the conflict in Afghanistanmay come to an end by the end of the year. If this fall?s reboundcontinues, the 62% retracement level of this year?s decline crossingat 10094.10 is the Dow?s next target. INTEREST RATES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=interestDecember T-bonds extended this week?s sharp sell off on Friday andtested the 75% retracement level of the Sept./Oct. rally crossing at104-29. December bonds have decline over 5 points since Tuesday.While momentum indicators are bearish signaling that additionalweakness is possible during the last half of November I would not besurprised to see a modest short covering bounce early next week.Longer-term the door is open for a possible test of September?s lowcrossing at 102-17. The CRB INDEX http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=indexesThe CRB index closed higher on Friday due to a rebound in energies,grains, fiber and foods. Session lows fell short of testing trendlinesupport drawn across this fall?s lows. Closes below this supportlevel crossing near 186 are needed to confirm that the shallowrebound off October?s low has ended. At the same time closes abovethis week?s high crossing at 190.46 are needed to renew this fall?srally. ENERGY MARKETS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=energyThe energy markets closed higher on Friday due to short covering asit consolidated some of this week?s sharp losses. However, upsidepotential appears limited due to the possibility of a protractedfight between Russia and OPEC that could last for some time. December crude oil posted an inside day with a modestly higher closedue to light short covering. However, December remains poised to testof the 75% retracement level of the 1998/2000 rally crossing at 16.83later this month. If this support level fails to halt this fall?sdecline the January 1999 reaction high crossing at 13.75 is apossible target later this fall. Momentum indicators are bearishsignaling that additional weakness is possible during the last halfof November."," Fri, 16 Nov 2001 14:42",144185,1.1828511953353882,,,,,

The University of Michigan's index of consumer confidence is scheduled for release at 10:00 a.m. EDT.Fiber-optic equipment maker JDS Uniphase said it incurred a fiscal 1Q loss of $1.2 billion or $0.93 per share. CFO Anthony Muller said the company would have lost $0.03 per share if restructuring and merger related costs were excluded, matching the consensus First Call estimate. JDS Uniphase blamed a slump in demand for telecommunications equipment for its woes, but the company's CEO said he sees a ""low-point"" in demand by December or March.

I would rate this email as ""Neutral"" with regards to potential signs of accounting fraud or illegal activities. While there are some red flags, such as the wide loss reported by JDS Uniphase and VeriSign's warning about falling short of expectations, these alone do not necessarily indicate any wrongdoing. It is important to consider other factors, such as overall financial performance and industry trends, before making any conclusions.","## Score: 2

This email primarily focuses on company news and market updates, with minimal mention of accounting practices. While the email mentions the company's Q1 loss and its potential impact on future earnings, there is no evidence to suggest that the accounting practices employed are abusive or manipulative. The language used in the email primarily focuses on the company's financial performance and future outlook rather than the accounting practices employed. Therefore, a score of 2 is assigned, indicating that while the email does not explicitly engage in misleading or fraudulent accounting practices, it lacks the context and detail necessary to determine whether the accounting practices employed are appropriate or not.","The email about JDS Uniphase and Verisign discussing revenue warnings with their quarterly earnings reports is a clear indication of abuse of accounting rules as they are hiding losses by placing them in the SBE. The email about Amgen reporting 3Q net income of $0.30 per share, $0.01 better than the First Call consensus estimate and VeriSign's warning that 4Q revenues would fall short of expectations also indicate abuse of accounting rules as they are hiding losses by placing them in the SBE.

**Reasoning:**

This email contains a list of stock prices and losses.

**Potential Abuses:**

* **Lack of Transparency:** The email does not provide enough information about the accounting practices used to generate the reported revenue.
* **Misleading Information:** The email may contain inaccurate or misleading information, as it does not provide any supporting documentation or context.
* **Potential Fraud:** The email does not provide any evidence to suggest that the accounting practices are fraudulent, but it does raise concerns about the potential for fraud due to the lack of transparency and the complexity of the information presented.

**Score:** 8

**Reasoning:**

This email indicates a potential abuse of accounting rules due to the large loss notification of $34.81 million. While the email subject line mentions ""Loss Notification,"" the content suggests that the losses are being hidden rather than reported. The use of the phrase ""LIMIT-($7.00 Million)"" is particularly concerning as it implies that the company is intentionally manipulating its financial statements to deceive investors. The email score of 8 reflects the severity of this potential abuse, as it falls short of outright fraud but clearly indicates an attempt to deceive.","The email that discusses the accounting practices at Enron and mark to market accounting is not an abuse of the accounting rules, as it does not indicate any fraudulent behavior.
