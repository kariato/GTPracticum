Hi Bobby,
Thanks for your email. In terms of recording the shares on the balance sheet, you would record a decrease in treasury stock for the 1,000 shares sold and an increase in cash or other assets for the $2,000 received. The company's total number of shares would remain at 60,000, but the amount of outstanding shares would decrease by 1,000 and the cash or other assets would increase by $2,000.
Please let me know if you have any further questions.

The email does not appear to be attempting to hide losses or engage in any fraudulent accounting practices.

This email primarily focuses on the documentation and accounting of share transactions for GOPUSA.com, Inc. It does not mention any accounting practices or mark-to-market accounting, therefore I cannot determine whether it indicates an abuse of accounting rules or not.

However, the email does mention the sale of 1,000 shares to Kathleen's parents at $2/share, which could potentially be misleading or inaccurate. If the company's accounting practices are not transparent and accurate, this could be considered an abuse of accounting rules.

Therefore, I have assigned a score of 2, indicating that there is potential for abuse of accounting rules, but not necessarily outright fraud.","The email about mark to market accounting practices being viewed as fraud is a 10 on the scale of 0 to 10 because it indicates that the company was using these practices to hide losses and deceive investors.

The email about accounting practices being legal and transparent is a 0 because it does not address whether or not these practices were ethical or appropriate. Finally, the email about recording share transactions is a 0 because it does not indicate any abuse of accounting rules or fraudulent behavior.","Subject: RE: recording share transactionsI should be able to help on that.

For instance, Enron had reported net income of $105 million for 1997, a figure that Enron last week said will be reduced to $9 million in its upcoming restatement for that year. Enron said the reduction is mostly because of $51 million in various unexplained ""audit adjustments and reclassifications"" that its auditors had proposed in 1997 but at the time had determined to be ""immaterial."" Cumulatively, those immaterial adjustments added up to nearly half of Enron's net income for 1997 and now will be included in the company's restatements.

According to the SEC's May settlement order with Sunbeam, Andersen auditors had routinely dismissed so many violations of GAAP as immaterial that they eventually piled up to produce significant distortions in Sunbeam's financial statements, making the barely solvent consumer-products maker look handsomely profitable. Sunbeam filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court protection this past February. In May, the SEC filed a civil lawsuit against five former Sunbeam executives and the Andersen partner in charge of the company's audit, accusing them of engaging in a massive financial fraud; all six defendants have denied the SEC's allegations.

Subject: Recording share transactions
Hi Bobby,
Thanks for your email. To record the sale of shares, you would debit the treasury stock account and credit the cash or bank account for the amount received. In this case, since you sold 1,000 shares at $2/share, you would debit the treasury stock account by $2,000 (60,000 x $2) and credit the cash or bank account by $2,000. This will reflect the decrease in the number of shares held by the company and the increase in cash or bank balance.

Our aggressive use of accounting management vehicles, and early sales of positions has significantly reduced our accounting volatility and economic exposure. Hopefully, the following points will address the appropriate issues.Currently we have invested $108 million in 22 companies. Of that, approximately $80 million still has accounting exposure. The other $28 million invested has either been hedged or already written down. Our disciplined use of Fair Value accounting has allowed us to minimize accounting risk by not writing up investments simply because of improving market conditions.Specifically - Avici, Sycamore, and FastForward have generated approximately $180 million in earnings this year. DEN, Salus Media, and IAM.com have combined for $9 million in writeoffs.Recently, I have done a review of our portfolio and I believe our accounting loss exposure for 2001 is limited. Over 80% of our portfolio companies have raised enough capital to sustain them through all of 2001. So, if the markets (private and public) are closed, I do not believe these companies will risk bankruptcy during 2001. Also, our discipline of only co-investing with big partners helps assure these companies will continue to get funding.Going forward, we are making certain revisions to our strategy to take compensate for, and take advantage of, the weak markets.Limiting venture investments to technology companies that we have a competitive advantage in assessing the technology risk. Also, moving our venture effort earlier stage to take more technology risk and less market risk.We are beginning to look at other types of private equity investments. There are many public companies, whose stock prices are at 10% or less of their highs. I still believe that the fundamentals of the industries indicate that the vast majority of these companies will go bankrupt. However, there will be a select few that will survive and will end up with reduced competition and big markets. These companies will be big winners. We are carefully looking for these. I will keep you informed as this develops.If you have any other questions, please let me know.Thanks,Kevin Garland"," Sun, 3 Dec 2000 15:01",,,,,443255,0.9503753185272217,

Accounting rules should be based on the concept of risk and reward, requiring companies to list more of the assets and liabilities that are at risk on the balance sheet, Berardino wrote in a piece entitled ""Enron: A Wake-Up Call."" Current rules have fostered a ""technical, legalistic mindset that is sometimes more concerned with form than with substance,"" Berardino said. Enron, whose auditor was Arthur Andersen, filed for bankruptcy protection after posting a third-quarter loss of $1.01 billion in October. The Houston-based company used off-balance-sheet financing vehicles that enabled it to boost leverage without reporting to investors the increased debt on its balance sheet. The U.S. financial reporting model, which emphasizes historical information and a single earnings-per-share number, was created in the 1930s, when most assets were tangible and there were no derivatives or off-balance-sheet financing. It needs to be updated to take into account new complex financial structures and the associated risks, Berardino said. Today, disclosures should be continuous, not periodic, and include performance indicators beyond earnings-per-share, Berardino said. Berardino also said that it takes too long to set new standards because regulatory responsibilities are shared by too many agencies. ""Responsibility for administering discipline is too diffuse and punishment is not sufficiently certain to promote confidence in the profession,"" Berardino wrote.

The email that discusses the use of off-balance sheet financing vehicles to boost leverage without reporting to investors the increased debt on its balance sheet is also an abuse of accounting rules as it violates the principle of full disclosure and transparency.

The email acknowledges the destruction of documents related to the Enron engagement and the fact that it occurred shortly after the SEC requested information from Enron. However, it also emphasizes that document disposal is a routine practice in auditing and that Andersen had a policy in place for retaining documents when litigation is threatened. The email does not provide clear evidence of an intent to hide losses or abuse accounting rules, but it does raise concerns about the timing of the document destruction and the lack of consultation with legal counsel before doing so. Therefore, I would score this email as a 5 on the scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is no abuse and 10 is outright fraud. However, further investigation and review of additional evidence may be necessary to fully assess the situation.","The email does not directly discuss any specific accounting practices or their potential abuse. However, it does mention that Andersen's destruction of documents related to its audit work for Enron was ""unusual, routine and wholly legitimate practice of auditors"" and that the policy towards document disposal reflects longstanding and sound audit practice. The email also states that Andersen notified the Department of Justice, the SEC, and all relevant congressional committees after the document destruction came to light, and that it suspended its records management policy and asked former Senator Danforth to conduct an immediate and comprehensive review. Based on this information, I would score this email as a 0 on the scale of 0 to 10, where 0 is no abuse while 10 is outright fraud.","<Email Start>
The email discusses the retention and destruction of documents by auditors, specifically in relation to the Enron engagement. It states that it is a usual practice for auditors to preserve their final working papers while disposing of drafts, personal notes, and other materials that are not necessary to support the audit report. The policy toward document disposal reflects longstanding and sound audit practices and is designed to assure that the audit work papers unambiguously reflect the judgments that actually were reached.

The email also mentions that Andersen's lead partner on the Enron engagement, David Duncan, called an urgent meeting of the Enron engagement team, at which he organized an expedited effort to shred or otherwise dispose of Enron-related documents. This activity appears to have stopped shortly after Andersen received a subpoena from the S.E.C.

Overall, I would score this email as a 7 on the scale of 0 to 10. While the email does not explicitly state that the document destruction was done to hide losses or engage in fraudulent activities, it does mention that Andersen's lead partner organized an expedited effort to dispose of Enron-related documents without consultation with others in the firm or legal counsel. This raises concerns about the potential for improper behavior and could be seen as a form of document manipulation.

This email exhibits some questionable practices, but not necessarily outright fraud. The main concerns are:

* **Lack of transparency:** The email does not disclose the purpose of the document destruction or the specific documents that were destroyed.
* **Lack of consultation:** The firm did not consult with other partners or legal counsel before destroying the documents.
* **Potential violation of audit standards:** The email suggests that the firm may have violated auditing standards by destroying documents that could be necessary for future audits.

However, the email also includes some mitigating factors:

* **Standard practice:** The firm claims that document destruction is a routine practice among large accounting firms.
* **Retention policy:** The firm has a documented document retention policy that is designed to comply with legal requirements.
* **Immediate response:** The firm took immediate action upon learning of the document destruction and notified relevant authorities.

While the email mentions the potential severity of the situation and the SEC's enforcement chief's stance on the matter, it does not delve into the specific accounting practices or whether they constitute abuse of the accounting rules.

However, it also mentions that Andersen has admitted its employees disposed of or deleted documents related to its audit of Enron, which could indicate an abuse of the accounting rules. The email about the destruction of documents is more ambiguous and does not provide enough information to determine whether there was any wrongdoing. However, it is a serious matter that should be investigated further.","Enron's accounting firm, Andersen, has admitted its employees disposedof or deleted a number of documents related to its audit of Enron.Andersen, which has come under fire from investors and lawmakers forsigning off on Enron's books, said it had notified the SEC, the JusticeDepartment and congressional committees and other agencies investigatingEnron's collapse. In recent months individuals in the accounting firminvolved with the Enron engagement disposed of a significant butundetermined number of electronic and paper documents and correspondencerelating to the Enron engagement. The SEC's enforcement chief says thatthe destruction of documents was an extremely serious matter. In testimonybefore Congress last month, Andersen CEO said it had warned Enron ofpossible illegal acts, but said it had failed to provide the auditor withkey information. Some industry experts say the deliberate destruction ofkey document can be tantamount to an admission of guilt. The ramificationscould be huge. Most accounting firms keep their audit records for at least4 years.

Japanese Accounting Changes
November 18, 2001 - Derivatives Week (Learning Curves)
There have been major changes to accounting standards in Japan which, by the time they have all been implemented will have brought Japanese accounting standards broadly into line with international norms. These changes are comprehensive and include the introduction of fair value -- or mark-to-market -- accounting. This last change, although seemingly innocuous will be particularly powerful in its impact. But What Has All This To Do With Derivatives? The introduction of mark-to-market accounting requires listed Japanese companies to record their holding of marketable property assets and securities at current market value rather than at book value. This means that balance sheets will no longer be buttressed by assets valued at inflated bubble economy levels. But most crucially profit streams will become exposed to movements in equity markets, as the definition of securities includes the cross shareholdings which bind members of Japan's Keiretsu and other business groupings. These are substantial in Japan, accounting for perhaps 40% of all shareholdings. The unwinding of cross shareholdings is undoubtedly one of the factors behind the recent weakness of Tokyo stock prices, not least as foreign buyers who had been soaking up much of the unwound cross held shares coming onto to the market have been notably absent over the past few months. Hence there has been much talk about how best to unwind these cross shareholdings without further depressing the market. Where possible firms with mutual shareholdings have been seeking arrangements that are effectively straight swaps. But derivatives can also play their part. Many corporates with large shareholding disposal programmes have been actively seeking to hedge their equity exposure as they embark on their share sale process. Often they have effected this through the use of call options. Thus if the market falls they have at least benefited from the premium earned at the time of the sale of the call option and if the market rises and the option is called by the purchaser then the shares have been successfully disposed of, but without further dampening an already weak market.

The email discusses the impact of Japanese accounting changes on derivatives. It mentions that listed Japanese companies will now have to record their holding of marketable property assets and securities at current market value rather than book value, which means that balance sheets will no longer be supported by assets valued at inflated bubble economy levels. The email also notes that the introduction of mark-to-market accounting requires Japanese companies to expose their profit streams to movements in equity markets, as the definition of securities includes cross shareholdings which bind members of Japan's Keiretsu and other business groupings.

The email does not appear to be hiding any losses or attempting to commit fraud through accounting practices. However, it is important to note that the use of derivatives to hedge equity exposure during a share sale process can be a complex issue, and it is possible that the way in which these derivatives were used could have been manipulated to hide losses or meet certain financial targets. Therefore, I would score this email as having a moderate risk of abuse of accounting rules (6 out of 10).","## Score for the email: 2

Here's the breakdown of the score:

* **0:** The email ""Accounting practices  we placed on the books are 100% legal and trasparent"" indicates no abuse of accounting rules.
* **10:** The email ""I'm concerned that the mark to market accounting practices that we placed the loses in the Raptor SBE could be viewed as Fraud"" indicates the highest level of abuse.

The email in question falls somewhere in between these two extremes. While it does not explicitly state the intention to hide losses, it does define a broad scope of records that could potentially be used to conceal financial irregularities. This could be seen as misleading or unethical, even if it does not constitute outright fraud.","The email about placing loses in SBE and mark to market accounting practices is a 10 on the scale of 0-10, indicating outright fraud.

Subject: Re: Lucy, Expenses and Recordkeeping

Dear Phillip,

Thank you for your email regarding the expenses and recordkeeping at Enron. I am glad that we are focusing on these issues to ensure transparency and accuracy in our financial reporting. However, I have a few concerns about the accounting practices that you have implemented or plan to implement:

1. No Overtime without written instructions - This policy could be restrictive for employees who need to work beyond their regular hours to complete their tasks. It is essential to ensure that employees are not penalized for working extra hours when necessary.
2. Daily timesheets faxed to you daily - Requiring timesheets every day may be excessive and time-consuming for both the employee and the manager. It would be better to have a weekly or biweekly timesheet requirement, which allows employees some flexibility in managing their work hours.
3. Paychecks issued by you at the State Bank - This practice could create a potential conflict of interest, as you may have access to sensitive financial information that is not available to other employees. It would be better to have an independent third party handle payroll and financial transactions to maintain transparency and trust.
4. Limiting office or landscape expenditures - While it's essential to control unnecessary expenses, limiting basic operational expenses could negatively impact the work environment and employee morale. It is crucial to find a balance between controlling costs and ensuring that employees have the necessary resources to perform their duties effectively.

Regarding the checkbook spreadsheet, I would like to discuss the yellow highlighted items in more detail. Please gather receipts so we can review them together and ensure that all expenditures are legitimate and necessary for our operations.

Thank you for your attention to these matters.

Best regards,
Lucy

2. In regards to the file server data, are there any specific legal or regulatory requirements that EES must comply with in terms of data retention and backup practices?
3. Can you explain the rationale behind not taking copies or mirror images of the 300 employees' hard drives and associated floppy disks at this time? Are there any potential risks or concerns that need to be addressed?
4. If additional data preservation measures are required, how will EES determine what constitutes a ""business reason"" for retaining certain data?

The email does not contain any clear indication of an attempt to hide losses or abuse accounting rules. The discussion in the email appears to be focused on the technical aspects of data entry and system conversion for financial reporting purposes. There is no mention of mark-to-market accounting, Raptors, or any other practices related to Enron's controversial accounting methods. However, it is important to note that this email alone does not provide sufficient evidence to make a definitive conclusion about the accounting practices at Enron. Further investigation and analysis of additional emails and documents would be necessary to fully assess the situation.","<Email Start>

Rod,
We get one template from each operating company at a specified level in the ownership chain. This template contains the minimum number of accounts necessary in order to achieve our external reporting requirements. For example, an operating company will submit a template with only one G&A account. However, they will report interest expense gross of capitalized interest since we disclose our capitalized interest in a footnote. Any intercompany accounts which get eliminated in consolidation are detailed out. The templates are manually entered into Oracle.
Most of the Cayco's and BV companies which sit above the operating companies only have equity earnings and interest expense/income type entries and those are accounted for here. Azurix Corp. has more detail type entries but these are primarily G&A, DD&A, intercompany billings and equity earnings.
Kenny, correct me if I am wrong, but I think you are using the oracle system in a similar manner. Data actually comes out of many systems and you input that data into oracle to help prepare financials. As to the availability of people to keep the old system running, if we have to, we can offer bonuses to get people to hang around.

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- There may one good thing that comes out of the Enron Corp. (ENE) financial mess - stricter accounting rules governing consolidation of financial results.Enron acknowledged earlier Thursday that it incorrectly accounted for its relationships with related partnerships by keeping them off its financial statements. It corrected that mistake by consolidating the partnerhips into its results, a move that led Enron to restate three years worth of earnings, lowering them by a collective $586 million. Under current accounting regulations, companies don't have to consolidate loss or income from entities in which they have an interest below 51%, keeping those losses or gains off their books (the balance sheets and income statements). The Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, has been working on a project that would replace the standard of ownership by a more encompassing one of control. But that project has been languishing since 1982 when the board first started considering the issue. ""This is an area where FASB is struggling"" to set new criteria, said Alan Bromberg, a professor of corporate and securities law at the Dedeman School of Law of The Southern Methodist University. FASB has struggled in part because companies were fighting the changes and it has had difficulty in defining control to mean something other than majority ownership. The Enron's restatement and consolidation is also focusing attention on another arcane accounting rule, one dealing with minimum ownership by unaffiliated outsiders. Under a statement made by the Securities and Exchange Commission during an Emerging Issue Task Force meeting over a decade ago, the SEC stated that a minimum outside investment was needed for the special purpose entity to qualify for non consolidation. This guideline has remained in effect ever since. According to EITF documents dated 1989 and 1990, a minimum outside investment of 3% or more in a special purpose entity may be necessary, depending on the credit risk, for it to qualify for non-consolidation status. Given that some of the special entities created by Enron were controlled by some of its former executives, experts said it's possible that the SEC was considering the outside ownership of these entities insufficient for them to qualify for non consolidation. Meanwhile, it's unclear how Arthur Andersen LLP, Enron's independent auditor since the late 1980s, will be affected by the company's restatement and recent financial turmoil. A spokesman for Arthur Andersen said his firm ""continues to cooperate with Enron and its special committee to bring a resolution to this matter."" The accounting giant has had some recent run-ins with shareholders and regulators because of accounting issues. It recently agreed to pay $110 million to settle a shareholder lawsuit over audits it conducted for Sunbeam Corp. Sunbeam had been accused of overstating its revenues and subsequently went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

* **Lack of transparency:** The email does not provide enough details about the accounting practices or the basis for the $6.8 million expectation.
* **Potential for manipulation:** The email suggests that the sender has the ability to edit the accounting practices, which could be abused to hide losses.

Dear team,
I understand your concern about having a consistent breakdown for Enron's back office processes. However, I would like to clarify that our accounting practices are 100% legal and transparent. We follow the mark-to-market accounting method, which allows us to recognize revenue as profit, even if we have losses in our SBE (Special Purpose Entities) such as Raptors. This approach is widely used in the industry and has been approved by regulators.
Please note that our accounting practices are designed to provide a fair representation of our financial position, and we comply with all relevant accounting standards.

Deloitte & Touche's report, which includes an unmodified opinion for the review year ended August 31, 2001, has been accepted by the Peer Review Committee of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' (AICPA) SEC Practice and is available at the AICPA, http://www.aicpa.org/members/div/secps/index.htm . Every three years since 1978, major accounting firms, under the oversight of the Public Oversight Board (POB), have been engaged to conduct reviews of the accounting and auditing practices of member firms in the AICPA SEC Practice Section (SECPS). The scope of this year's peer review of Andersen was expanded after financial reporting issues emerged at Enron Corp. Andersen requested, and Deloitte & Touche had separately concluded, that expanded procedures were appropriate. Deloitte & Touche independently determined the scope of the expanded peer review procedures.In total, the peer and Andersen's internal practice review covered 240 Andersen audit engagements in over 30 Andersen offices and the Andersen national office. The engagements reviewed by Deloitte & Touche reviewers and Andersen practice review teams involved some 45 percent of Andersen's U.S. audit partners. The engagements selected for review represented a cross-section of Andersen's accounting and auditing practice with emphasis on higher-risk engagements. It included examining working paper files and reports and interviewing engagement personnel. Deloitte & Touche's opinion was ""unmodified,"" without qualification. However, three issues not deemed significant enough to affect the opinion were raised in an attached comment letter. Such comments are not unusual in peer review reports. The comments related to: documentation of certain auditing procedures on some engagements; communications with audit committees in some instances; and management representation letters that needed more tailoring in some instances. In its response to Deloitte & Touche's comments, Andersen said it had taken, or would take, the steps recommended to improve its accounting and auditing practices.

This email discusses the issue of hiding debt through various accounting practices. While it does mention the Enron scandal and its use of mark-to-market accounting, the email primarily focuses on other companies and their potential accounting abuses. Therefore, the score of 8 reflects the fact that while the email mentions the Enron scandal and its accounting practices, it does not provide enough evidence or context to determine whether the email indicates an abuse of accounting rules.

**Key points:**

* The email mentions the use of pro forma earnings, which may leave out recurring expenses and are often referred to as ""earnings before all the bad stuff.""
* It discusses the use of special-purpose entities (SPEs) to hide debt.
* The email mentions the use of extensive lease agreements to cover debt.
* It highlights the potential liability of data processor EDS and J.P. Morgan Chase related to their partnerships with Enron.

While the email touches upon the Enron scandal and its accounting practices, it primarily focuses on other companies and their potential accounting abuses. Therefore, the score of 8 reflects the lack of evidence or context provided in the email to determine whether it indicates an abuse of accounting rules.","The email about Cisco's use of pro forma earnings and its inventory loss charge does not indicate any abuse of accounting rules.

Many people have questions regarding how Enron will be operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.

During the reorganization, the Company will continue its GAAP reporting, with a breakout of pre and post petition liabilities, as well as historical management/operational reporting, consistent with past practices.In addition, the Company will have an added responsibility to report cash flows to the bankruptcy court and its various constituents. Specifically, Enron will be required to report projected cash receipts and cash disbursements by business unit on a weekly basis. The court and our new debtor-in-position (""DIP"") lenders require a rolling 13 week projection of cash flows plus monthly projections thereafter to obtain a full year of projected cash flows. The budgeted weekly projections will then be compared to actual results to determine how well each business unit is operating compared to the projections. The weekly and monthly forecasts will be adjusted each week pursuant to revised or improved information on forecasted cash flows. Thus this process will be an ongoing one, with constant updating of information to ensure we generate the most accurate reports possible.The initial weekly and monthly projections will be critical to the determination of the amount that the DIP lenders will be willing to make available to the Company. In addition, the cash flows for the entities that are included in the bankruptcy proceedings will be utilized by the bankruptcy court and DIP lenders to constantly review and react to the cash flow situation at Enron. However, all Enron business units (not just ones in bankruptcy) will need to conform to these new requirements, because additional entities are likely to be included in the bankruptcy filing and because it is extremely important for Enron management to be able to see the totality of cash flow requirements for the entire Company.The weekly cash flow projection project will be overseen by Mike Deville (x 57852) and Greg Adams (x 33887). In addition, Enron has retained Batchelder & Partners, Inc., a financial advisory firm, to assist us in this and other reorganization efforts.We will be having a group meeting with the CAO's and/or their designees from the various business units responsible for the cash projections on Wednesday, December 5 at 2:00 PM in the Boardroom on the 50th floor to further explain this process and answer any questions you may have.

This email discusses the potential issues with the accounting practices at Enron, including the use of Special Purpose Entities (SPEs) and the lack of transparency. While the email acknowledges the complexity of modern business and the challenges faced by auditors, it primarily focuses on the need for improved accounting standards and regulations. The email does not explicitly make any claims about the abuse of accounting rules, therefore I have scored it at a 6.

* **Positive aspects:**
    * Acknowledges the complexity of modern business and the challenges faced by auditors.
    * Emphasizes the need for improved accounting standards and regulations.
    * Discusses the potential impact of improved accounting standards on the overall financial reporting system.
* **Neutral aspects:**

* **Negative aspects:**
    * Does not provide concrete examples or evidence to support its claims.
    * Does not provide any solutions or recommendations for how to address the issues discussed.

While most of what we do is contained within Enron's electronic systems, there still are times when hard copies are made or needed for running our business. Here is how you must handle those hard copy documents:
1. The basic rule is that if you have hard copies of documents that are used in EPMI's business of selling energy in the WSCC, you must keep those documents until further notice. If space becomes a problem, please contact _____ who can arrange for storage.
2. What constitutes a document? In some instances, you will have one copy of a document that has your handwritten notes on it, and another copy that may be clean. For these purposes both are considered documents and both must be saved. Similarly, if several people have copies of the same document, each separate copy is considered a separate document. On the other hand, if you made 10 copies for a meeting and there were 4 left over that were never handed out or were not used, those may be recycled so long as you keep the ones that were used. If you keep handwritten notes for your work, those would be considered documents as well. Telephone notes, charts, printouts of data, spreadsheets etc. all constitute documents. If you have a question about what constitutes a document and whether it should be saved, please ask Christian Yoder and Steve Hall.
3. The goal and purpose of this policy is to make sure that no hard copies of documents are discarded that are relevant to the wholesale electricity market litigation. If hard copy documents are discarded at a later point in time, EPMI and/or its employees will be criticized for failing to preserve documents relevant to the wholesale electricity litigation.
4. Personal documents such as shopping lists, personal messages from friends unrelated to the energy business etc. are not covered by this policy and you may do with them as you wish.
Tim, if you have questions about this policy, please call me.

This email primarily discusses the issues of auditor independence and the use of pro forma statements, not specifically the abuse of accounting rules. While the email mentions the Enron scandal and its impact on the accounting profession, it does not provide enough information or context to determine whether the email indicates an abuse of accounting rules. Therefore, I have scored this email a 2/10, as it primarily focuses on broader issues related to the accounting profession rather than the specific question of whether it constitutes abuse of accounting rules.","The email with a score of 10 indicates an abuse of accounting rules as it discusses how Enron used mark to market accounting practices to hide losses and revenue was realized as profit by hiding true financial position. The email with a score of 0 does not indicate any abuse of the accounting rules as it discusses that auditors are paid by and act on behalf of shareholders, which is true. However, the email with a score of 10 also mentions that audit itself makes little profit, which may be untrue for some firms. The email with a score of 10 also discusses how Enron used special vehicles to hide liabilities and this practice was not legal or transparent. Overall, the emails indicate an abuse of accounting rules in varying degrees.","LONDON -(Dow Jones)- Issues bedeviling the accounting profession for years have finally flashed into the headlines, thanks to Enron and the bursting of the Internet bubble.Unhappily, most are unlikely to be solved anytime soon. Questions of auditor independence and the use of pro forma statements are at the fore. Not far behind are ones on accounting for options and goodwill. And then there's the issue of which standards to use. Right now, ""who guards the guardians"" has leapfrogged to the top of the agenda. The Enron collapse shows that auditors need to be more independent. It's a thinly-disguised fiction that auditors are paid by and act on behalf of shareholders. Clearly, it's corporate management doing the hiring and firing of auditors. And audit itself makes little profit. Instead, accountants rely on consulting and more technical or specialized practices, like M&A, to generate fees. An accountant refusing to pass a company's results runs the risk of losing a big part of his own business. Even the risk of litigation isn't - or at least hasn't been pre-Enron - enough of a deterrent. What's the solution? Make sure companies that audit aren't swayed by conflicts of interest. Regulators should either encourage stand-alone audit firms or prohibit auditors from any other involvement with the companies they scrutinize - even if that's tricky for big international corporations, which can use all of the ""big five"" accounting firms in the course of a year's global dealings. Another dilemma is the issue of pro formas. There's a mounting consensus that pro forma statements are suspect. According to some estimates, pro forma results for S&P 500 companies during the third quarter overstated audited profits by 70%. Why should companies push their pro formas when, after all, there's a perfectly good U.S. audited accounting standard: the U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)? Enron notwithstanding, surveys show investors are more confident with U.S. corporate results than those from Europe or Japan. And yet, U.S. GAAP has its own problems. U.S. accounting is rigidly based on rules, unlike elsewhere, where it's more a case of applying broad principles. Though these rules are designed to ensure standards, they're often subverted by loopholes. U.S. companies can comply with the letter of the law but still offer a distorted picture of fundamentals. The result is that while investors are flooded with information, it's not always helpful in determining a company's value. Enron highlighted one such loophole. The company went under in large part because it was taking on huge, unseen liabilities. These liabilities weren't on the balance sheet, having been planted on special vehicles nominally independent of the firm."," Fri, 18 Jan 2002 14:32",,,,,323622,1.1240521669387817,

This email exhibits some questionable accounting practices, but not necessarily outright fraud. The email highlights the potential issue of mark-to-market accounting practices being used to hide losses, which could be viewed as misleading and potentially unethical. However, the email does not provide enough information to determine whether the practices are actually fraudulent or not.

**Here's a breakdown of the email:**

* **Subject:** ""RE: PG&E Action before Bankruptcy Court"" - This email is about a separate company, PG&E, and not directly related to Enron's accounting practices.
* **Content:** The email mentions the potential impact of the accounting practices on the company's litigation case and their desire to maintain the old accounting convention. It also includes a forwarded message from another employee expressing concern about the potential fraud related to the mark-to-market accounting practices.
* **Score:** 6 - While the email does raise concerns about potential accounting malpractice, it does not provide enough information to determine whether the practices are actually fraudulent or not. The email score is therefore lower than the score for the other two emails, which explicitly state their abuse of accounting rules.

Matt Kimber, a director with Arthur Andersen's financial practice,welcomes initiatives to collect internal loss data to increase the breadthof information available. However, he goes on to say that users of theinformation ""will have to be mindful of the parameters as to how theinformation is ""gathered and prepared."" Similar criticisms are also levelledat publicly disclosed external loss databases, where issues of caring andcleansing must be considered.Last month, ISDA issued a discussion paper, Operational Risk RegulatoryApproach Discussion, on operational risk capital charges. The paperhighlights concerns that a purely quantitative approach could enableinstitutions with poor operational risk management processes and controls,but with access to internal loss event data, to achieve a lower capitalcharge that institutions with stronger risk management processes but noaccess to internal loss event data. The paper also highlights fears over themethod of calculation of operational risk capital for an institution thathas recently experienced serious loss, butwhere management has reacted and strengthened the control environment inthat area, and consequently reduced the likelihood of reoccurrence.The paper, produced with the active support of over 20 ISDA member firms andfacilitated by PriceWaterhouseCoopers, sets out a series of structured andtransparent qualitative assessment criteria - with particular reference toquantitative criteria - to complement the operational risk data requirementscurrency proposed by regulators. The paper argues blat there is strongsupport in the industry for a regulatory capital assessment model thatallows institutions managing operational risk to effectively access a moreprecise means of Calculating an operational risk capital charge -institutions should benefit from more sophisticated controls and theregulatory regime should establish incentives to improve risk management andcontrols. This is consistent with proposed quantative techniques onceinternal loss data isincorporated into the operational risk capital charge calculation, as anyinstitution with an effective control environment would normally expect tohave a lower loss experience, and thus a lower capital charge."," Tue, 28 Nov 2000 04:23",,,,,152280,1.142845630645752,

The email does not contain any indication or suggestion of any wrongdoing or abuse of accounting rules by the sender or Enron specifically.","<Email Start>
The accounting scandal at Enron Corp. has prompted other companies to consider following a move by Walt Disney Co. to cease using their external auditors to do consulting work. While many companies say they see no need to separate the functions, Cornin g Inc., Mirant Corp. and New York Times Co. are among those saying they might consider the step. The collapse of Houston energy trader Enron Corp. brought new scrutiny to the common practice of companies using one accounting firm both to audit the books and to provide lucrative consulting services -- with companies sometimes paying much more for the nonaudit services. Some audit firms, facing strong criticism of the practice, aren't waiting for clients to act. Yesterday Arthur Andersen LLP, which audited and did consulting work for Enron, became the latest to react. Andersen said it will no longer accept internal-audit and financial information-systems work from publicly traded clients to which it provides external audit services. Disney last week became the first major company to announce it would separate auditing from consulting, saying that though there were no problems with outside auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, it wanted to be free from concerns about auditor independence. Disney's move rendered moot a shareholder initiative, scheduled for the annual meeting later this month, that questioned the company's use of its auditor for consulting services. Many companies try to ensure audit independence through rules that require board members to approve the use of outside accountants for other services. Others place limits on the fees paid to accountants. At the same time, questions about the practice are prompting executives to re-examine their policies, to make sure safeguards are sufficient to prevent conflicts of interest. This week, Corning's board-level audit committee will consider adding restrictions to its auditing and consulting-fee policies, said Paul Rogoski, a company spokesman. In light of the Enron situation, ""we're going to look at what our current process is and see if it needs to be updated,"" Mr. Rogoski said. For 2000, the most recent figures available, Corning, a Corning, N.Y., optical-fiber maker, paid $2.5 million in auditing fees to Pricewaterhouse and $13.3 million to the firm in consulting fees. Mirant, an Atlanta energy firm, says it probably will study the Disney move as part of a ""constant review"" of its audit policy, though it typically tries to separate audit work from consulting jobs. ""We're making every effort we can to be non-Enron-like,"" a company spokesman said. In 2000, the company paid Arthur Andersen LLP $2.2 million for auditing services, another $1.1 million for financial information-systems services, and $10.1 million for other services, including help with its initial public offering and tax consulting.

**Email Score:** 6

**Reasoning:**

This email exhibits some questionable accounting practices, but not necessarily outright fraud. The email highlights the potential for a write-down adjustment based on new information and the potential impact on current quarter earnings. While the email mentions the need for support and documentation, it does not delve into the specifics of the accounting rules or procedures. The email score of 6 reflects the potential for accounting manipulation and the need for further investigation.

**Key Points:**

* **Potential for write-down adjustment:** The email acknowledges the possibility of a write-down adjustment based on new information and the potential impact on current quarter earnings.
* **Lack of transparency:** The email does not provide sufficient details about the basis for the write-down adjustment or the accounting rules that were followed.
* **Need for documentation:** The email emphasizes the need for documentation to support the adjustment, but does not provide specifics on what documentation is required.
* **Potential for scrutiny:** The email acknowledges the potential for scrutiny from auditors and the need to be able to explain the basis of the write-down adjustment clearly.

**Overall:**

While the email does not exhibit outright fraud, it does raise concerns about the potential for accounting manipulation and the need for further investigation. The email score of 6 reflects the potential for abuse of accounting rules and the need for caution.","The email about the accounting practices at Enron discuss devrivatives and mark to market accounting is a 0 on the scale of 0 to 10 because it does not indicate an abuse of the accounting rules.

This email discusses the debate surrounding the use of special charges in accounting and their potential impact on financial reporting. While the email touches on the topic of mark-to-market accounting and its potential for misleading financial statements, it primarily focuses on the debate surrounding the exclusion of special charges from official financial statements. 

The email highlights the lack of standardization in pro forma calculations and the potential for companies to manipulate these calculations to their advantage. However, it also acknowledges the potential benefits of excluding certain charges, such as those related to restructuring or one-time events, in order to provide a more accurate representation of a company's financial position.

Overall, the email provides a nuanced discussion of the accounting rules surrounding special charges and their potential impact on financial reporting. While it does not explicitly indicate whether the email constitutes an abuse of accounting rules, it does raise important questions about the transparency and accuracy of financial reporting.

Therefore, I would score this email a 2 out of 10.",The email with score of 10 indicates an abuse of accounting rules as it suggests that the company is hiding losses by placing them in a separate entity and then reporting profits. The email with score of 0 does not indicate any abuse of accounting rules as it simply discusses the different ways companies can report their financial position. The email with score of 10 also indicates an abuse of accounting rules as it suggests that the company is hiding losses by placing them in a separate entity and then reporting profits.,"The significance of special charges -- whether they represent old baggage from the past or illuminate the future -- is at the center of a lively debate under way in the accounting world. One side holds that generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, provide the best available snapshot of a company's financial position. GAAP, which companies must use in their official financial statements, requires that nearly all charges be treated as ordinary expenses. Others, including many stock analysts, contend the best view comes from ""pro forma"" financial results -- calculated ""as if"" many expenses didn't really exist. The idea is that these expenses aren't relevant to future performance. Companies increasingly highlight the pro forma view in news releases they generally put out before their official filings with regulators. But pro forma calculations adhere to no particular standard. Companies essentially do what they want. Now, accountants and economists say the practice of excluding blemishes is so widespread that companies and analysts often guide investors to dismiss charges that contain prescient warnings -- like the one at Bethlehem Steel. Ms. Applebaum, the Salomon Smith Barney analyst who played down Bethlehem's big write-off, explains that she has covered other steel companies that returned to profitability shortly after writing off deferred tax assets. She thought Bethlehem would do the same. She notes that GAAP rules on such assets obliged Bethlehem to follow strict criteria in assessing its chances of future profitability -- stricter criteria than stock analysts typically use. As for Bethlehem, Chief Financial Officer Leonard M. Anthony says the charge the company took was to some extent ""predictive of the future."" GAAP also has well-established standards for writing down other kinds of assets. Companies must reduce the value on their books of anything from a customer loan to a manufacturing plant when its worth has diminished. Again, Wall Street stock analysts tend to dismiss the resulting charges as one-time events. Sometimes that makes sense. During the 1981-82 recession, restructuring was a part of many corporations' strategies. They took charges for streamlining, outsourcing and otherwise shedding costs to position themselves for recovery. Because the resulting earnings volatility made it hard to compare companies' growth rates or price-earnings ratios, and because the charges weren't expected to recur, there was logic to excluding them to come up with ""smoothed"" earnings trends. ""Investors came to look upon the charges, correctly in many cases, as evidence that those firms had recognized past mistakes and had made tough decisions to become more efficient,"" said a September 2001 study by the Jerome Levy Economics Institute at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y."," Mon, 31 Dec 2001 09:28",,,,,323085,1.1519925594329834,

It does not contain any indication or suggestion of hiding losses or abusing accounting rules.","<Email Start>In a speech at the American Enterprise Institute, Bolkestein reaffirmed the European Union's commitment to requiring all E.U.-based companies to use the International Accounting Standards (IAS) practices in their record keeping in order to enhance transparency and provide higher quality financial information to investors across the world.""The use of one global accounting language will greatly benefit European companies. It will help them compete on equal terms for global capital,"" Bolkestein said. He added that the legislation would require companies to begin preparing their consolidated accounts using IAS by 2005. Bolkestein also said he is hopeful that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will begin to accept financial statements prepared by firms in the European Union without requiring them to be reconciled with the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) standard used in the United States. A major reason that changes are needed in the European Union's financial regulations is because of the ""unprecedented volume of mergers and acquisitions"" between American and European firms. Another reason is that the European Union has established a goal of becoming ""the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable growth with more and better jobs, and greater social cohesion,"" Bolkestein said. Since 1990, Bolkestein said the European community has added 900,000 jobs and has seen improved competition and productivity add 1.5 percent to gross domestic product growth because of measures taken to create a single market for financial services. If the European Union is successful at restructuring its financial system by 2005, Bolkestein said he sees other benefits to include a lower cost of capital for all companies, a deeper and more vibrant venture capital market, lower costs of purchasing financial products, and higher returns on pensions and investment funds. To realize those benefits, Bolkestein said the European Commission would like to see an integrated securities market in place by 2003, replacing the individual domestic securities markets of the European Union's 15 member states. ""Mergers and alliances between existing exchanges are already breaking down barriers, pooling liquidity, reducing clearing costs, decreasing volatility, and increasing transparency,"" Bolkestein said. He added that Europe is also seeing ""a marked increase in the number of online brokerage accounts, which further contributes to efficiency and transparency,"" but also creates a greater need for changes in the way the European Union regulates its financial sector.

This email is mostly about the potential benefits of international accounting standards and their impact on the European economy. It does not mention Enron or accounting practices specifically, therefore I cannot score it as an abuse of accounting rules.

However, the email does mention the potential for increased transparency and lower costs associated with international accounting standards. These points could be seen as misleading or biased depending on the context, therefore I have scored it at a 2/10.",The email with score 10 indicates an abuse of accounting rules as it hides losses using mark to market accounting so revenue was realized as profit. The email with score 0 does not indicate any abuse of the accounting rules.,"In a speech at the American Enterprise Institute, Bolkestein reaffirmed theEuropean Union's commitment to requiring all E.U.-based companies to use theInternational Accounting Standards (IAS) practices in their record keepingin order to enhance transparency and provide higher quality financialinformation to investors across the world.""The use of one global accounting language will greatly benefit Europeancompanies. It will help them compete on equal terms for global capital,""Bolkestein said. He added that the legislation would require companies tobegin preparing their consolidated accounts using IAS by 2005.Bolkestein also said he is hopeful that the U.S. Securities and ExchangeCommission will begin to accept financial statements prepared by firms inthe European Union without requiring them to be reconciled with thegenerally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) standard used in the UnitedStates.A major reason that changes are needed in the European Union's financialregulations is because of the ""unprecedented volume of mergers andacquisitions"" between American and European firms.Another reason is that the European Union has established a goal of becoming""the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world,capable of sustainable growth with more and better jobs, and greater socialcohesion,"" Bolkestein said.Since 1990, Bolkestein said the European community has added 900,000 jobsand has seen improved competition and productivity add 1.5 percent to grossdomestic product growth because of measures taken to create a single marketfor financial services.If the European Union is successful at restructuring its financial system by2005, Bolkestein said he sees other benefits to include a lower cost ofcapital for all companies, a deeper and more vibrant venture capital market,lower costs of purchasing financial products, and higher returns on pensionsand investment funds.To realize those benefits, Bolkestein said the European Commission wouldlike to see an integrated securities market in place by 2003, replacing theindividual domestic securities markets of the European Union's 15 memberstates.""Mergers and alliances between existing exchanges are already breaking downbarriers, pooling liquidity, reducing clearing costs, decreasing volatility,and increasing transparency,"" Bolkestein said.

IMPORTANT EPMI POLICY REGARDING HARD COPY DOCUMENTS
WHILE LITIGATION IS PENDING
This policy is in addition to my prior email about the procedure for handling email and electronic documents. While most of what we do is contained within Enron's electronic systems, there still are times when hard copies are made or needed for running our business. Here is how you must handle those hard copy documents:
1. The basic rule is that if you have hard copies of documents that are used in EPMI's business of selling energy in the WSCC, you must keep those documents until further notice. If space becomes a problem, please contact _____ who can arrange for storage.
2. What constitutes a document? In some instances, you will have one copy of a document that has your handwritten notes on it, and another copy that may be clean. For these purposes both are considered documents and both must be saved. Similarly, if several people have copies of the same document, each separate copy is considered a separate document. On the other hand, if you made 10 copies for a meeting and there were 4 left over that were never handed out or were not used, those may be recycled so long as you keep the ones that were used. If you keep handwritten notes for your work, those would be considered documents as well. Telephone notes, charts, printouts of data, spreadsheets etc. all constitute documents. If you have a question about what constitutes a document and whether it should be saved, please ask Christian Yoder and Steve Hall.
3. The goal and purpose of this policy is to make sure that no hard copies of documents are discarded that are relevant to the wholesale electricity market litigation. If hard copy documents are discarded at a later point in time, EPMI and/or its employees will be criticized for failing to preserve documents relevant to the wholesale electricity litigation.
4. Personal documents such as shopping lists, personal messages from friends unrelated to the energy business etc. are not covered by this policy and you may do with them as you wish.
Tim, if you have questions about this policy, please call me.

**Reasoning:**

This email exhibits some questionable practices but does not necessarily constitute outright fraud. The email discusses document retention and mentions the ongoing litigation. While the language ""hide true financial position"" is concerning, the overall tone suggests a focus on document management rather than manipulating financial records. The email also includes a disclaimer about personal documents and encourages recipients to contact the sender if they have any questions.

However, the email's tone and language could be improved. The use of strong language like ""fraud"" and ""hide true financial position"" without providing evidence to support such claims could be misleading and potentially harmful. Additionally, the email's structure and organization could be better. The inclusion of unrelated personal comments and the lengthy disclaimer at the end may distract from the main topic of document retention.

A second memo, cited by congressional investigators, shows that an Enronexecutive who warned the company's chief executive that it was in danger ofbeing swamped by accounting irregularities also voiced concerns to Andersen inAugust 2001.  The first memo -- drafted Feb. 6, 2001, by an Andersen auditor on the Enronaccount named Michael Jones -- recounts a meeting the day before of Andersenexecutives about whether the accounting firm should continue working for Enron.Such a ""retention meeting,"" as the memo calls it, isn't unusual in itself. But,the memo recounts the executives discussing many of the alleged problems thathave become the focus of criminal, civil and congressional investigations intoEnron's collapse. Enron, of Houston, filed for bankruptcy-court protectionunder Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on Dec. 2, the largest such filingever, and investigators increasingly are focusing on Andersen's role.  ""Significant discussion was held regarding the related-party transactionswith LJM, including the materiality of such amounts to Enron's income statementand the amount retained `off balance sheet,' "" the memo says, referring to aprivate partnership that kept Enron debt off the company's books. The memospecifically mentions ""conflicts of interest"" by then-Enron Chief FinancialOfficer Andrew Fastow, who controlled that partnership and others like it, andthe fact that he received compensation from it.  Such partnership arrangements contributed greatly to Enron's collapse.Widespread publicity of them last fall caused a crisis of investor confidencein the company that helped drive down the company's stock. Written eight monthsbefore Enron's downward spiral began, the memo raises nearly every accountingissue that led to the energy-trading company's downfall, including its need tomaintain a high credit rating. Decisions by rating agencies to downgradeEnron's rating were followed soon after by the company's bankruptcy filing.  The memo describes discussions of how the partnership transactions weredescribed in footnotes in Enron financial statements and mentions efforts tomake sure Andersen auditors ""fully understand the economics and substance ofthe transactions."" Another ""significant discussion"" was held about how Enronvalued its earnings on such transactions and ""the fact that it was `intelligentgambling.' "" The memo notes that Enron was ""aggressive in its transactionstructuring.  ""Ultimately, the conclusion was reached to retain Enron as a client [because]it appeared that we had the appropriate people and processes in place to serveEnron and manage our engagement risks,"" the memo says."," Thu, 17 Jan 2002 08:01",,,,,323164,1.1547019481658936,

But we can't stop at Arthur Andersen. The real ""values"" crisis represented by the Enron mess is far deeper, and stretches across our economy. We are all being victimized by it, and the situation is growing ever worse. It is the great unreported business story of our time: the growing failure of the accounting system to accurately capture what is going in the new hyperspeed economy. Simply put, we have no idea what any company is worth today. The accounting industry is mired in a system that was devised 600 years ago and has only been fine-tuned ever since. It doesn't work any more. Accountants know it, corporate executives know it, and the stock market knows it. The general recognition of this fact has led to a widespread ethical sloppiness made manifest in such things as Arthur Andersen's apparent conflict. The reality is that the only time anybody really checks an audit anymore is after a financial disaster like Enron, when scapegoats must be found. Rear-View Mirror Accounting I once likened traditional accounting to driving a car by only looking in the rear view mirror. It can tell you where a company has recently been, but it is unable to tell you where that company is now. And in a world in which change occurs in nanoseconds, such obsolete data is worthless. Today, events arrive so swiftly, and change so constant, that it is no longer even enough to operate in the present. Modern business now runs in the future. The result is a growing gap between traditional ""book"" value and actual market value - and through that gap drives not only companies like Enron, but truly valuable firms like General Electric and Intel. Traditional accounting has long dealt with that gap through a line entry entitled ""goodwill."" But it was typically only added when a company sold for more than the total value of its inventory, buildings, etc. At most, this goodwill only represented a few percent of the total value. That was then. In the modern economy, for great, fast moving, innovative young companies this so-called ""goodwill"" can represent 90 percent of their value. When a corporate audit can only tell us about ten percent of a company, what the hell is the point? There have been a number of efforts in recent years to come up with innovative new ways to determine corporate value, many of them under the all-encompassing terms ""intellectual capital"" or ""intangible assets"". But they are still in their earliest stages, and most slam up against the formidable wall of the traditional accounting industry."," Thu, 24 Jan 2002 14:28",,,,,323049,1.1611692905426025,

This email falls into the category of ""potentially abusive accounting practices"" with a score of 2 out of 10. While it does mention the ongoing litigation and the requirement to preserve documents related to the LJM partnerships, the tone and language used suggest an attempt to downplay the severity of the situation and potentially mislead stakeholders. 

**Here's why:**

* **Lack of transparency:** The email does not explicitly state whether the company is experiencing financial difficulties or if the document preservation is related to potential accounting irregularities.
* **Misleading statements:** The email claims that the accounting practices are ""100% legal and trasparent,"" which is inaccurate. The email also states that the company will ""defend these lawsuits vigorously,"" which could be seen as an attempt to downplay the potential severity of the situation.
* **Overemphasis on compliance:** The email spends a significant amount of time discussing the legal requirements for document preservation, but does not provide much information about the potential impact of the litigation on the company or its stakeholders.

Overall, while the email does mention the requirement to preserve documents related to the ongoing litigation, the tone and language used suggest an attempt to downplay the severity of the situation and potentially mislead stakeholders.

* **Lack of transparency:** The email lacks clear and concise information about the accounting practices at Enron. It primarily focuses on the political implications of the situation rather than the accounting practices themselves.
* **Misleading statements:** The email claims that the accounting practices are ""100% legal and trasparent,"" which is inaccurate. The email acknowledges the potential for fraud and states that the firm was ""worried"" about the risk of financial statement fraud.

The review, performed by rival Big Five firm Deloitte & Touche, was part of an assessment carried out once every three years to check the quality of financial reporting of top firms.Andersen's accounting systems were ""deemed to provide reasonable assurance of compliance with professional standards,"" according to a statement from the Chicago-based firm. ""Deloitte's opinion was unmodified, without qualification,"" for the year ended Aug. 31, Andersen added. But the integrity of the process was criticized almost immediately by analysts, including professor Lynn Turner, a former Securities and Exchange Commission chief accountant and current director of the Center for Quality Financial Reporting at Colorado State University. ""If the process was really credible, I don't think we'd be having the rash of problems we are having today,"" Turner said. Turner cited reporting problems that have cost investors billions of dollars at Enron, such other Andersen clients as Waste Management Inc. and Sunbeam Corp., and similar high-profile failures at Cendant Corp., Rite Aid Corp. and MicroStrategy Inc. after audits by other accounting firms. Critics of the peer review process point to the fact that since the cooperative assessments began in 1978, no Big Five accounting firm has received a qualified opinion of its accounting procedures from a rival. When Enron filed for bankruptcy protection in December, it was Andersen's Houston office's largest client. The energy trader's collapse is the subject of a SEC investigation, lawsuits and a number of congressional probes. According to Deloitte's letter of comment, which accompanied the unqualified opinion, Andersen was told about a need to improve minor documentation and communication problems. Andersen's peer review was all but complete when it asked in November for the review to be expanded to include the Houston office responsible for auditing Enron, which had disclosed financial reporting problems that led to $1.2 billion being chopped from shareholders' equity. The assessment did not look specifically at the audit Andersen performed on Enron, because there is ""pending litigation"" over reporting problems, according to Deloitte's letter.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Its apologists, however, would have a stronger case if so many pro forma statements weren't such an obvious attempt to cheerlead or to obscure the audited numbers.

This email does not explicitly mention hiding losses or using any abusive accounting practices. However, the request for headcount information and cost estimates raises some concerns about the potential manipulation of financial data. The timing of the request and the level of detail requested suggest that the information will be used for purposes other than mere headcount tracking. Additionally, the reference to ""unique situations"" in the email could imply that there may be attempts to conceal certain information from the requester. Overall, the score is 7 out of 10 due to the potential for manipulation and the lack of transparency in the request.","## Score for the email: 2/10

This email primarily focuses on requesting headcount information and cost estimates for the accounting department. While it mentions the potential for accounting practices being viewed as fraudulent, the tone is more concerned with data accuracy and completeness rather than manipulating financial records. Therefore, the score is 2/10, indicating a low level of abuse.

**Reasons:**

* **Lack of direct relevance:** The email's subject and content do not directly relate to the Enron scandal or the issue of accounting fraud.
* **Focus on data accuracy:** The email emphasizes the need for accurate and complete headcount and cost estimate data, rather than manipulating financial records.
* **No evidence of misleading or deceptive intent:** The email does not exhibit any evidence of intentionally misleading or deceptive accounting practices.

**However:**

* **Potential for bias:** The email mentions the potential for the accounting practices being viewed as fraudulent, which could be biased or alarmist.
* **Lack of transparency:** The email does not provide sufficient details or context about the requested data or the potential consequences of not providing it.

**Overall:**

While the email mentions the potential for accounting practices being viewed as fraudulent, the tone and content primarily focus on data accuracy and completeness rather than manipulating financial records. Therefore, the score is 2/10.","The first email is a 10 on the scale of 0 to 10.

**Email Score:** 2

**Reasoning:**

This email primarily focuses on the issue of recording retention and guidance for traders on recorded lines. While it mentions the potential issue of non-compliance with the 6-month policy, the primary focus is on the technical aspects of recording management rather than the potential manipulation of financial records. Therefore, the score of 2 reflects the relative lack of concern about accounting rule abuse in this email.

**Key Points:**

* The email acknowledges the potential issue of non-compliance with the 6-month policy but does not delve into the specifics of the problem.
* The email primarily focuses on the technical aspects of recording management rather than the potential manipulation of financial records.
* The email does not provide any evidence to suggest that the author is attempting to hide losses.

**Conclusion:**

While the email does mention a potential issue with the implementation of the 6-month policy, the overall tone and content do not indicate an abuse of accounting rules. Therefore, the score of 2 is appropriate.","The email about placing loses in SBE is a clear indication of fraud as it hides true financial position from investors.

The email about news about the accounting practices at Enron discussing derivatives and mark to market accounting is a clear indication of abuse of accounting rules as it hides true financial position from investors. However, the email about tape recordings being destroyed after 6 months is not an indication of fraud or abuse of accounting rules as it is a standard practice in many companies to destroy tapes after a certain period of time.","Subject: Tape recordingsJeffIn the context of the SFA audit and also your request for info about this some time ago (apologies for the delay), I've done some research into our current practice and procedure on taping and the position is as follows:The current policy is to destroy recordings after 6 months.However, this policy is not being implemented by our Telecoms group at the moment which is awaiting confirmation that the 6 month period is appropriate (not clear why).

This email falls into the category of ""potentially abusive accounting practices"" with a score of 6 out of 10. While the email does not explicitly state the intention to hide losses, it does highlight the potential for such practices through the use of mark-to-market accounting and the misleading reporting of revenue as profit. The email also mentions the potential difficulty in investigating the case due to the destruction of documents, which could be seen as an attempt to obstruct justice.

However, the email does not provide enough evidence or context to definitively determine whether it constitutes outright fraud. The email primarily focuses on the potential consequences of the destruction of documents and the potential penalties for Arthur Anderson. Therefore, a score of 6 is more appropriate as it acknowledges the potential for abuse but does not necessarily confirm it.","The email you provided does not indicate any abuse of accounting rules.

Criminal charges may still be in store for top Enron executives, who sold nearly $1 billion worth of their company stock, possibly knowing it was improperly inflated, before it plummeted. Thousands of employees were not so lucky, and lost their lifetime savings. Close to 60 percent of all employee 401(k) money was tied up in Enron stock. Congress should consider a proposal by Senator Jon Corzine to cap the percentage of employees' retirement accounts that can be held in company stock. The third issue that Congress and the S.E.C. need to address is the lack of public confidence in financial reporting. Beyond Enron's questionable behavior, the most alarming failure of all may have been that of its outside auditor, Arthur Andersen, to flag the company's dubious accounting practices. Enron is only the latest and most dramatic instance of an accounting firm's failing to protect the public from largely fictional financial reporting by a major company. The accounting industry insists it can regulate itself, but the evidence points to the contrary. Firms have placed themselves in an untenable conflict of interest by providing the same companies they audit on behalf of the public with an array of consulting services. Congress ought to pass legislation to bar such conflicts. Unsuspecting Enron employees were the most direct victims of the company's lack of forthrightness, but overall investor confidence in the integrity of the marketplace took a serious hit with Enron's demise.

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to express my concern about the accounting practices that we have been using at Enron. Specifically, I am worried that our use of mark-to-market accounting and the Raptor SBE has been used to hide losses and realize revenue as profit. This could potentially be viewed as fraudulent behavior.
I understand that these practices may be legal, but I believe it is important for us to be transparent about our financial position. I would like to see an open forum discussion on this topic at the upcoming Global Accounting Leadership Offsite in Galveston, Texas.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
Sincerely, [Name]

This email exhibits some questionable accounting practices and raises concerns about potential fraud. While the email does not explicitly state the intention to hide losses, the language used and the context of the situation suggest that this may be the case.

**Here's a breakdown of the email:**

* **Lack of transparency:** The email does not disclose whether the accounting practices were approved by the company or whether they deviated from generally accepted accounting principles.
* **Misleading statements:** The email claims that the accounting practices are ""100% legal and trasparent,"" which is inaccurate. The firm's own guidelines call for disposing of documents on a regular schedule, not keeping them indefinitely.
* **Potential destruction of evidence:** The email mentions the destruction of computer files, which could be interpreted as an attempt to conceal evidence of wrongdoing.
* **Timing:** The email was sent shortly after Enron issued a press release disclosing the SEC investigation, which raises questions about the timing of the destruction and whether it was intended to conceal the company's financial difficulties.

We are developing a process to validate all new curves the day they are created.
Our global exception reporting captures books & deals that do not make it into any of the VAR, credit, or DPR.
An inventory of active books in the RAC website (which all risk management personnel have access to) is being created. This is a short term fix until the counterparty book library initiative can meet our needs (not before March).

However, it does not provide enough information to determine whether the practices are actually abusive or not.

**Here's a breakdown of the email:**

* **Potential for abuse:** The email mentions the possibility of the mark-to-market accounting practices being viewed as fraudulent, which suggests that the author is aware of the potential for abuse.
* **Company's position:** The email highlights the company's stance against the TURN accounting practices, and their desire to maintain the old accounting convention. This could be seen as an attempt to justify the use of mark-to-market accounting practices.
* **Lack of information:** The email does not provide enough information about the specific accounting practices in question, or the company's financial standing. This makes it difficult to determine whether the practices are truly abusive or not.

New Rules by End of 2003 For that to occur, and to remedy the concerns of securities regulators, IASB effectively has to significantly improve a variety of accounting rules and issue new ones by the end of 2003. In addition, IASB expects to tackle a project on business combinations quickly and hopes to have it done in comparatively short order. The focus of the planned work on merger and acquisition accounting would be to consider barring the pooling-of-interest methods of accounting and adopt the purchase method instead. IASB also plans to target the treatment of goodwill, a key element in purchase accounting, and weigh a possible adoption of impairment against the survival of the written down of goodwill acquired in a combination. As with all standard-setting projects and less substantial efforts, the board has its eye on convergence. It is working toward issuing a single set of high quality accounting rules that could be used by companies around the world in raising capital. Heavy Involvement of National Boards The path to that goal will include heavy involvement of major national standard-setting bodies in the rulemaking of IASB. The mechanisms for that work -- which are to include joint projects and other ""partnership working arrangements"" -- were detailed in a meeting May 24 with the heads of standard-setting panels from Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. IASB has formal ""liaison"" relationships with those boards. A sharing of human resources by the sparely staffed IASB and groups such as the U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board would be complemented by a trading of knowledge, the rulemakers suggested. ""I expect that the FASB will gain as much as it gets out of the work of IASB,"" FASB Chairman Edmund Jenkins told the international board and his counterparts from around the world. IASB 'Not a Dictator' At the May 24 meeting, IASB Chairman David Tweedie and his colleagues sought to provide assurances that the newly restructured international panel will not usurp the authority of the national standard-setters. In forging shared-work arrangements on topics such as stock-based compensation, or share-based payments, revenue recognition, and consolidations policy, there will be no directives to national boards to arrive at a particular conclusion, Tweedie suggested.

Investigators believe documents may have been destroyed by Andersen in both the Houston and Chicago offices. Andersen, which is rewriting its policy on document retention, called a halt to the destruction of Enron materials on Nov. 10, the day after the SEC subpoenaed the auditing firm.

Subject:CASH & REORG FINANCIAL REPORTING FINANCIAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTSMany people have questions regarding how Enron will be operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. This memo addresses the financial reporting requirements Enron will have to its various constituents. During the reorganization, the Company will continue its GAAP reporting, with a breakout of pre and post petition liabilities, as well as historical management/operational reporting, consistent with past practices.
In addition, the Company will have an added responsibility to report cash flows to the bankruptcy court and its various constituents. Specifically, Enron will be required to report projected cash receipts and cash disbursements by business unit on a weekly basis. The court and our new debtor-in-position (""DIP"") lenders require a rolling 13 week projection of cash flows plus monthly projections thereafter to obtain a full year of projected cash flows. The budgeted weekly projections will then be compared to actual results to determine how well each business unit is operating compared to the projections. The weekly and monthly forecasts will be adjusted each week pursuant to revised or improved information on forecasted cash flows. Thus this process will be an ongoing one, with constant updating of information to ensure we generate the most accurate reports possible.
The initial weekly and monthly projections will be critical to the determination of the amount that the DIP lenders will be willing to make available to the Company. In addition, the cash flows for the entities that are included in the bankruptcy proceedings will be utilized by the bankruptcy court and DIP lenders to constantly review and react to the cash flow situation at Enron. However, all Enron business units (not just ones in bankruptcy) will need to conform to these new requirements, because additional entities are likely to be included in the bankruptcy filing and because it is extremely important for Enron management to be able to see the totality of cash flow requirements for the entire Company.
The weekly cash flow projection project will be overseen by Mike Deville (x 57852) and Greg Adams (x 33887). In addition, Enron has retained Batchelder & Partners, Inc., a financial advisory firm, to assist us in this and other reorganization efforts.
We will be having a group meeting with the CAO's and/or their designees from the various business units responsible for the cash projections on Wednesday, December 5 at 2:00 PM in the Boardroom on the 50th floor to further explain this process and answer any questions you may have.

While the email does not explicitly state the intention to hide losses, it does raise concerns about the potential for accounting malpractice and misleading financial reporting. The memo detailing an executive meeting discussing the amount of debt kept off Enron's books and the potential consequences of such practices highlights the potential for misleading financial statements and the potential for accounting fraud. The email score of 6/10 reflects the potential for abuse of accounting rules, but not necessarily outright fraud.

**Justification:**

* The email mentions the possibility of misleading financial statements and potential accounting malpractice, which indicates an awareness of the potential for abuse.
* However, the email does not provide evidence to support this claim or explicitly state the intention to hide losses.
* The email primarily focuses on the potential impact of the memo on the company and its stakeholders rather than the potential impact on the accounting profession.

Therefore, while the email raises concerns about the potential for accounting malpractice, it does not necessarily indicate outright fraud. The score of 6/10 reflects the potential for abuse of accounting rules, but not necessarily the actual intent of the sender.","The email with a score of 10 indicates an abuse of accounting rules.

Guys:
As you all know, our group is in the middle of a very significant amount of development and equipment book management activity, This hard work by all of you has allowed us to achieve very impressive income results thus far this year, and has set the stage for continued success. It has also placed significant demands on internal resources that are integral to our success, in particular those resources in Global Finance, Accounting, and Legal. In order to ensure a proper prioritization of work flow, and that project specific objectives and time lines are communicated, I need each of you to come to me with all new agreements prior to seeking input from Accounting and Global Finance. I will interface with these two groups and establish priorities for their review.
We will continue to refine how we interface with these groups, and as such, I'd appreciate any suggestions you would have. I plan to have a staff meeting next week, and we can discuss it at that time.
Thanks, Ben

**Email Score:** 2

**Reasoning:**

This email exhibits some questionable practices, but not necessarily outright fraud. The email highlights the achievements of the group and mentions the significant demands placed on internal resources. However, it also emphasizes the need for proper prioritization of work flow and clear communication of project objectives and timelines. The email also mentions the need to refine the interface with Accounting and Global Finance, implying that there may be issues with current practices.

While the email does not explicitly attempt to hide losses, it does emphasize the positive aspects of the group's achievements and downplay the challenges faced. This could potentially be seen as misleading or manipulative, especially in light of the company's recent financial difficulties.

Overall, the email score is a 2 because it exhibits some questionable practices, but does not necessarily constitute outright fraud. The email score could be higher if it were more explicit in its attempts to hide losses or if it made false or misleading statements about the company's financial position.","The email about placing loses in the SBE is a clear indication of abuse of accounting rules as it hides true financial position from investors. The email about mark to market accounting practices being legal and transparent also indicates an abuse of accounting rules as it does not report losses so revenue was realized as profit hiding true financial position. However, the email about news about the accounting practices at Enron discussing derivatives and mark to market accounting is not a clear indication of abuse of accounting rules as it simply mentions the use of these practices without any discussion on their legality or transparency. Therefore, I would score the email with a 0 for no abuse while 10 for outright fraud.","Subject: Interface with Accounting and Global FinanceAs I mentioned, this e-mail was the product of a meeting this week with Duran, Deffner, Bills and me.

This email discusses the use of structured finance deals at Enron. While the email mentions the potential for accounting improprieties, it does not provide enough information to determine whether the practices described are abusive or not. The email primarily focuses on the use of structured finance deals to manage debt and accelerate earnings, rather than the accounting practices themselves. Therefore, it is not possible to score this email with a definitive number, as it does not provide enough information about the specific accounting practices being discussed.","The email with the score of 10 indicates an abuse of accounting rules as it suggests that Enron was hiding losses by placing them in a separate entity called Raptors and then marking to market those assets.

The research is expected to include a close reading of FASBdocuments chronicling that board's odyssey toward what it calls the""impairment-only approach"" for goodwill.As noted by FASB members now on IASB, the U.S. board went down that pathbecause it tries wherever possible to avoid affording choices in accounting.The impairment-only method is favored by many in commerce because itprevents the drag on earnings presented by the automatic writedown ofgoodwill.Tweedie Offers Project ProposalsOther topics that Tweedie suggested should be in the scope of IASB'spreliminary study leading to a rulemaking project on combinations are: jointventures, which Tweedie called a ""big escape route"" around the negativeeffects of the purchase method for combinations and goodwill amortization;dual listings of stock of otherwise joined enterprises, said to be anothermethod of accounting avoidance; and acquisition provisioning, a practice inthe United Kingdom.In Britain, where Tweedie headed the Accounting Standards Board in the 1990sand into 2000, the impairment test for goodwill in combinations is strongerthan the mechanism planned by FASB, the IASB chairman said. However, asTweedie and an IASB colleague, Warren McGregor, noted, the economy largelyhas been strong over the last several years. Thus, the impairment approachhasn't undergone a ""stress test"" to see how well it works, as McGregor said."," Thu, 24 May 2001 07:45",,, RE,,153152,1.192430019378662,

However, the destruction of documents and the potential cover-up of unethical behavior raises serious red flags.","## Score for the email: 8

This email exhibits several red flags that indicate potential abuse of accounting rules, although not necessarily outright fraud. 

**Here's a breakdown of the potential issues:**

* **Mischaracterization of income:** The email mentions ""nonrecurring item"" for the $1 billion charge, which could be misleading and potentially misconstrued by investors. This practice is often used to hide losses and artificially inflate profits.
* **Potential destruction of evidence:** The email mentions ""destruction of documents"" and ""urgent meeting"" with the intention of destroying documents, which could be seen as obstruction of justice or tampering with evidence.
* **Potential violation of attorney-client privilege:** The email mentions ""waiver of attorney-client privileged advice"" which could potentially expose sensitive information to the SEC or other investigators.

**However, there are also some mitigating factors:**

* **No explicit intent to deceive:** The email does not explicitly state the intention to deceive, although the language used could be interpreted as such.
* **Potential pressure from Enron:** The email mentions pressure from Enron to destroy documents, which could be seen as coercion or manipulation.
* **Potential lack of awareness:** It is possible that the individuals involved were not fully aware of the potential consequences of their actions.

Overall, while this email does exhibit some concerning practices, it does not necessarily constitute outright fraud.

Brushing up on a basic accounting textbook might have helped, some critics say. Confirming investors' fears, the Houston energy trader Thursday filed a lengthy disclosure document with the Securities and Exchange Commission declaring that its financial statements going back to 1997 ""should not be relied upon"" and will have to be restated. Among other problems, Enron acknowledged overstating its net income by a total of $586 million, or 20%. Enron's financial statements long have been widely assailed as indecipherable. Now, it turns out, they were just plain wrong.But what is most striking about the latest disclosures is that they show Enron's misstatements weren't limited merely to judgment calls and gray areas for the green-eyeshade crowd to debate. Portions of Enron's accounting practices amounted to violations of elementary accounting principles, some accounting specialists say. Citing client-confidentiality rules, an Andersen spokesman, David Tabolt, declines to comment on his firm's work for Enron, which on Friday agreed to be bought by crosstown rival Dynegy. He calls Enron's disavowal of its previous financial statements an ""unfortunate situation"" and says Andersen is cooperating with the SEC's Enron investigation and the special committee formed by Enron to investigate the company's accounting and disclosure practices. Consider the primary reason for the $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity that Enron revealed in mid-October, sparking much of the downdraft in the company's shares. At the time, Enron said the reduction came about because it had decided to unwind certain transactions with some limited partnerships with which it had done business. On Thursday, however, Enron acknowledged that the original accounting for the transactions violated generally accepted accounting principles. Starting in early 2000, the company said last week, Enron issued shares of its own common stock to four ""special-purpose entities,"" in exchange for which it received a note receivable. Enron said it had increased both its note-receivable assets and shareholder equity, a move the company called ""an accounting error"" that it is correcting. Under GAAP, the payment a company receives when issuing stock only counts as equity if it is cash. As a result, Enron's 2000 audited financial statements overstated the company's notes-receivable assets and shareholder equity by $172 million. And Enron's 2001 unaudited statements overstated them by $828 million. The $1 billion overstatement represents 8.5% of Enron's previously reported shareholder equity as of June 30."," Mon, 12 Nov 2001 07:27",,,,,260208,1.1933226585388184,

This email indicates a potential abuse of accounting rules due to the following concerns:

* **Denial of access to records:** The HR representative, Mr. Malik, denied access to supporting documentation for certain accounting transactions on the grounds that they are confidential. This is problematic because even the Controller does not have access to all of the supporting documentation.
* **Lack of transparency:** The email does not provide enough information about the nature of the accounting transactions or the specific documentation that is being withheld. This lack of transparency raises concerns about the potential for manipulating financial records.
* **Request for upper management intervention:** The email requests that upper management intervene and instruct Mr. Malik to grant access to the records. This is necessary because the current practices are not acceptable and need to be corrected.

However, the email does not provide enough evidence to support the allegations of fraud or manipulation. Therefore, the score of 8 is a cautious estimate.

**Recommendations:**

* The sender should provide more information about the nature of the accounting transactions and the specific documentation that is being withheld.
* The sender should attempt to obtain access to the records through other channels, such as by contacting Mr. Bhatnagar or another upper management executive.
* The sender should document the attempts to gain access to the records and any communications with Mr. Malik or other relevant parties.","The email with the subject ""India Internal Controls Assessment & Review and Cash Controls Standards"" does not indicate any abuse of accounting rules.

This email falls into the category of ""potentially abusive accounting practices"" due to its connection to the LJM partnerships and the ongoing litigation. While the email mentions the requirement to preserve documents related to the litigation, it does not explicitly state whether the accounting practices employed by Enron in relation to the LJM partnerships are in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles. Additionally, the email's tone is somewhat defensive and emphasizes the potential consequences of failing to comply with the document preservation requirements rather than the importance of accurate and transparent accounting practices.

Therefore, while the email does not explicitly engage in misleading or fraudulent accounting practices, it does raise concerns about the potential for abuse and lack of transparency in Enron's accounting practices related to the LJM partnerships.","The email that indicates an abuse of accounting rules is the one where they placed loses in a SBE called Raptors to hide them from investors. This is clearly an attempt to mislead investors and could be viewed as fraud. The other emails do not indicate any abuse of accounting rules, but rather discuss the legal requirements for document preservation related to the LJM partnerships.","Subject: FW: Important Announcement Regarding Document PreservationPlease handle.

**Email Score:** 8

**Reasoning:**

This email indicates a potential abuse of accounting rules due to the following factors:

* **Document destruction:** The firm's admission of destroying documents related to the Enron audit raises concerns about the potential manipulation of financial records.
* **Lack of transparency:** The firm's failure to describe the content of the lost records and the lack of transparency surrounding the shredding practices create a sense of distrust.
* **Potential bias:** The firm's endorsement of Enron's financial statements and its subsequent dismissal of the partner involved in the audit raise questions about potential bias and conflicts of interest.

However, the email score is not as high as 10 because it does not explicitly state false or misleading information or engage in fraudulent activities. The firm's actions may be unethical and unprofessional, but they do not necessarily constitute outright fraud.","The email with a score of 10 indicates an outright fraud as it clearly states that the accounting practices were used to hide losses and revenue was realized as profit.

The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, a professional group, said Friday for the first time that it would support any future proposal to impose certain limits on services accounting firms may provide to the companies they audit.The statement came a day after KPMG, one of the five major accounting firms, reversed its opposition to limits proposed two years ago, which would have prevented auditing firms from providing information technology consulting or internal audit services to the companies whose financial statements they audit. The two actions came on the heels of an announcement from the leading accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers, that it would spin off its consulting business into a separate entity. The plans, which had been in the works for many months, were accelerated because of concerns that the public perception of the accounting profession was hurting because of the Enron scandal. Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, acknowledged destroying documents and e-mails that were sought by federal and congressional investigators looking into questionable accounting practices which led to the swift collapse last fall of the energy trading giant. The non-audit consulting fees are often much more lucrative to the accounting firms than fees for auditing companies' books. For example, in 2001, The Walt Disney Co. paid PricewaterhouseCoopers $8.6 million for its auditing and $32 million for other services, according to its proxy statement. Critics contend the high fees could taint an auditor's objectivity when reviewing its client's books. On Thursday, Disney said it will not use its outside auditing firm for new consulting projects and will review those currently under way.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.
You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously. In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.

Two weeks ago, Mohamed Alabbar, the chairman of a public company in the United Arab Emirates, received a hurried visit from his auditors at Ernst & Young. The team asked him to declare that his company, Emaar Properties PJSC, had no off-the-books partnerships or off-balance-sheet debts. While Mr. Alabbar was ready to sign a document pledging that was the case right away, the auditors told him to take the document home for a couple of days and think about it first. ""All these auditors are sharpening their pencils,"" says Mr. Alabbar, who has even had his travel expenses questioned recently. ""It's like they are coming and sitting with you almost every day.""
The collapse of Enron Corp. has led global markets to retrench in fear of widespread accounting irregularities, forced at least one foreign official to resign, and focused attention on local accounting scandals. It also has prompted a rethink of accounting practices from Britain to the UAE to South Africa. In many ways, the Houston company's bankruptcy is being treated like a fault has been found in a critical airplane system, prompting a scramble to effect global repairs.
In Britain, ripples from the Enron affair claimed a first casualty Friday, when Lord John Wakeham, a former UK energy minister and accountant who served on Enron's audit committee, stepped down temporarily from his job as head of Britain's press complaints commission. Lord Wakeham has said he will remain on leave until he has cleared his name in the US investigation into Enron.
As in the US, the question of political donations from Enron has been raised in the UK, with the opposition Conservative Party charging that GBP 38,000 ($61,000) in Enron donations to the ruling Labour Party in 1997 to 2000 may have influenced the government to end a moratorium on the construction of gas-fired power stations. So far, the Tories have come up with no evidence to support their claim of impropriety and have had to admit that they accepted GBP 25,000 in Enron donations as well.
While the current political squall over Enron in the UK may blow over, there are likely to be lasting effects on British accounting regulations. Hard Davies, the head of Britain's newly consolidated Financial Services Authority, says he has set up an internal inquiry to look into lessons that the UK could learn from the collapse of Enron. Interviewed at the World Economic Forum in New York, Mr. Davies said plans for a review of Britain's accounting rules were already in place as a result of an earlier, domestic accounting scandal. But, he said, ""Enron has given that process a big kick.""
While Mr. Davies believes an Enron-style scandal is less likely in the UK because of differences in accounting practices, he says it is possible. Reforms in the pipeline would aim primarily to strengthen auditor independence.

But he said time for argument was fast running out. Whatever happened after the draft and invitation to comment were issued in the run-up to Christmas, ""Australia will have to make a choice."" Accounting bodies worldwide have been working on standards for financial instruments to prevent the derivatives -related disasters that rocked many companies during the late 1980s and early 1990s, including US company Procter & Gamble, which lost $US157 million on interest-rate derivatives in 1994. The matter has become urgent in Australia partly because the United States has introduced its own standard Financial Accounting Standard Board statement No133 which became effective for some companies on July 1, and which will operate from January 1 for those whose financial years coincide with the calendar. FAS 133 is regarded as a nightmare by corporate treasurers in the US and here, because it requires derivatives and other financial instruments to be ""marked to market"" every quarter, rather than accounted for on a fair-value basis. Its critics claim it will lead to volatility and confusion in company financial statements. Mr Alfredson said that in the US, ""there is now a special interpretation group like the Urgent Issues Group here interpreting 133. In other words, it is so complex, readers can't just read the standard and interpret it. The group has already issued more than 100 interpretations."" Australia has no accounting standard that deals comprehensively with the recognition and measurement of financial instruments, although it has made progress with disclosure requirements. Acknowledging the concern over the mark-to-market approach, the AASB commissioned the development of a fair-value model. The joint working group consists of representatives from Australia, Canada, France, Germany, New Zealand, the Nordic countries, Britain, the US and the International Accounting Standards Committee. IASC has incorporated elements of FAS 133 into its own much-criticised financial instruments standard, IAS39. It remains to be seen how much simpler the fair-value approach will be. ""In fair-value accounting, you get the market value for the instruments at the time and fair value them. It sounds easy in principle, but it is much more complicated in practice,"" Mr Alfredson said. Developing the appropriate standard is only half the battle, however; the trick is to gain widespread acceptance for it.

This email falls into the category of ""potentially abusive accounting practices"" with a score of 6 out of 10. While it does not explicitly state the intention to hide losses, the content and tone suggest that the author is attempting to downplay the severity of the situation. 

Here's a breakdown of the email's potential issues:

* **Misleading statement:** ""Accounting practices  we placed on the books are 100% legal and trasparent"" - This statement is inaccurate. The email mentions ""mark to market accounting"" which can be used to hide losses, making it misleading to claim that the practices are completely legal and transparent.
* **Lack of transparency:** The email does not provide enough information about the specific accounting practices or the potential impact on the company's financial standing.
* **Downplaying the issue:** The email focuses primarily on the potential impact of the SEC's new accounting oversight panel and the unrelated news about other companies, rather than the potential issues with Enron's accounting practices.

Overall, while the email does not explicitly state its intention to hide losses, the content and tone suggest that the author is attempting to downplay the severity of the situation. This makes it difficult for the reader to assess the true nature of the accounting practices at Enron.","The email about placing loses in SBE is a clear abuse of accounting rules. The use of mark to market accounting to hide losses is fraudulent and should be considered as such. The email about the executive meeting where debt was kept off Enron's books is also an abuse of accounting rules, but not as severe as the first one. The email about the news about the accounting practices at Enron discusses derivatives and mark to market accounting, which are both legal and transparent. Finally, the email about the Open Season for proposed Desert Crossing Gas Storage and Transportation System is not an abuse of accounting rules since it does not involve any financial statements or reporting.","A February 6, 2001 Andersen memo detailing a executive meetingwhere the amount of debt kept off Enron's books was discussed hassurfaced.

It hasalso been revealed that Andersen was warned of trouble at Enron lastsummer by the same executive who sent Kenneth Lay a memo detailing her concerns over the companys financial practices. The Enronexecutive then raised those same concerns in a conversation with anunidentified Andersen partner.

This email exhibits some questionable accounting practices, but not necessarily outright fraud. The email discusses the potential impact of the TURN accounting practices on a company's litigation case. The company argues that the old accounting convention should be kept alive to bolster their chances of recovery. This suggests that the company may be trying to manipulate accounting practices to their advantage, but it does not necessarily constitute fraud.

However, the email does raise concerns about the potential for accounting abuse. The email mentions the possibility of the TURN accounting wiping out hopes of collecting an undercollected amount. This suggests that the company may be using accounting practices to deceive investors or regulators.

The email does not appear to be hiding any losses or engaging in fraudulent accounting practices. It is a legal requirement for Enron to preserve documents related to the litigation involving LJM partnerships, and failure to follow these instructions could result in individual liability for civil and criminal penalties. The email also emphasizes that Enron will defend the lawsuits vigorously and instructs employees not to discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone outside of Enron and its counsel. Therefore, the score is 8 out of 10.","## Score for the email: 2

This email falls into the category of ""potentially abusive accounting practices"" due to its connection to the LJM partnerships and the potential for litigation.

This email exhibits some questionable accounting practices, but not necessarily outright fraud. The email discusses the suspension of normal document destruction policies due to ongoing litigation involving the LJM partnerships and Enron's accounting practices related to those partnerships. The email instructs employees to retain all documents related to the LJM partnerships, regardless of their relevance to the case. This could potentially inflate the company's records and misrepresent its financial position.

However, the email does not explicitly state any intention to deceive or manipulate financial records. It primarily focuses on complying with legal requirements and protecting the company's interests in the litigation. Therefore, the score is 6, indicating questionable accounting practices but not necessarily fraud.","The email that states ""Accounting practices  did not report losses so revenue was realized as profit hiding true financial position"" has a score of 10 on the scale of 0 to 10, indicating outright fraud.

I assume if we can keep surcharges from DA customers, we would not be that concerned with the undercollection recovery issues, except as they affect the ability to switch between DA and bundled sales. If we do plan to re-DASR our customers, then I guess we do care about these issues. Then would we likely want a long and drawn out amortization?There is also an opening in this case to adjust the ceiling, to implement tiering or other rate increases that are comparable to the PG&E/SCE rates that come out of the case Harry testified in two weeks ago, to redefine small commercial customer and to decide the future of a voluntary stabilization plan. Where would we stand on the definition of small customer, by the way?Of course all this is in addition to the surcharge rate design.I think Harry can eastily tweak the testimony he filed in the PG&E/SCE case for this case, and the question is how much farther do we need to go, if at all, on these other issues."," Fri, 4 May 2001 02:43",,,,,57622,1.2027702331542969,

However, the email does mention the need for ""rolling (4 quarterly snapshots + 12 months performance) data"" which could potentially be used to manipulate financial statements.

As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.
Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.
Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation.
Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.
Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.
You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.
You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously. In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.

The email discusses the document preservation policy for Enron in light of ongoing litigation involving LJM partnerships. The policy requires employees to retain documents related to these transactions, including accounting practices, until further notice. While there is no explicit mention of mark-to-market accounting or hiding losses, the email does suggest that certain accounting practices may be related to the litigation and should therefore be preserved. Therefore, I would score this email a 7 on the scale of 0 to 10 for potential abuse of accounting rules.","## Score for the email: 6

This email exhibits some questionable accounting practices, but not necessarily outright fraud. The email highlights the suspension of normal document destruction policies due to ongoing litigation involving LJM partnerships and the requirement to preserve documents related to these partnerships.

Additionally, the email emphasizes the potential penalties for failing to comply with the document preservation requirements, but does not provide any guidance on how to comply. Overall, this email raises concerns about the potential abuse of accounting rules, but does not necessarily constitute outright fraud.","The email that states ""Accounting practices did not report losses so revenue was realized as profit hiding true financial position"" has a score of 10 on the scale of 0 to 10, indicating outright fraud.

The email discusses organizational changes in the accounting group, but it does not provide any information that suggests an abuse of accounting rules or fraudulent activities. The consolidation of accounting groups and the appointment of new leaders do not indicate any wrongdoing or unethical behavior. Therefore, I would score this email a 7 on the scale of 0 to 10, indicating a moderate level of transparency and compliance with accounting practices.","## Score for the email: 2/10

This email primarily focuses on organizational changes within Enron rather than accounting practices.

* **Transparency:** The email clearly states the purpose of the organizational changes and mentions the individuals who will be responsible for each group.
* **Clarity:** The email is well-structured and easy to understand, even though it is a bit long.

* **Lack of detail:** The email does not provide enough information about the specific accounting practices that are being changed or the reasons behind them.
* **Lack of accountability:** The email does not mention any controls or procedures that are being put in place to ensure that the new accounting practices are followed accurately.

The email discusses the use of Special Purpose Entities (Raptor entities) and mark-to-market accounting practices, which were used to hide losses and realize revenue as profit. The email also mentions that the Raptor entities are technically bankrupt and that Enron has contributed contingent equity to these entities without reporting it as a loss. These actions could be considered an abuse of accounting rules and may not fully comply with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). However, the email does mention some transparency in their practices and mentions that they have included the shares in their fully diluted computations of shares outstanding if the current economics of the deal imply that Enron will have to issue the shares in the future. This suggests that there may be some compliance with accounting rules, but it is not clear-cut fraud as the email does indicate some concerns about the potential perception of these practices and the need for a cleanup plan.","The email suggests that there may be some abuse of accounting rules, but it does not outright indicate fraud.

This email exhibits some questionable accounting practices, but not necessarily outright fraud. The author acknowledges the potential for criticism and concerns over the mark-to-market accounting practices used to hide losses. However, the email primarily focuses on justifying the practices and minimizing their impact rather than acknowledging their illegality.

**Key points:**

* **Contingent Enron equity:** The author argues that the contingent Enron equity is not a significant concern as it has not been realized and therefore does not impact current earnings.
* **Fair-value investments:** The author acknowledges the loss of value in several equity investments but emphasizes the booking of gains from price risk management transactions.
* **Related-party transactions:** The author highlights the $500 million related-party transaction with Raptor and its impact on IBIT and NI.
* **Technical bankruptcy:** The author points out the technical bankruptcy of the Raptor entities and the potential impact on Enron's payments.

**Overall:**

While the email acknowledges potential concerns, it primarily focuses on justifying the practices rather than addressing their illegality. The author's tone is defensive and attempts to downplay the severity of the situation. The email score of 8 reflects the presence of questionable accounting practices and the potential for misleading financial reporting.",The email with a score of 10 indicates an abuse of accounting rules as it suggests that Enron used mark to market accounting practices to hide losses and revenue was realized as profit by hiding true financial position.

Personnel to quiz confidentially to determine if I'm all wet: a. Jeff McMahon b. Mark Koenig c. Rick Buy d. Greg Walley To put the accounting treatment in perspective I offer the following: 1. We've contributed contingent Enron equity to the Raptor entities.Since it's contingent, we have the consideration given and received atzero. We do, as Causey points out, include the shares in our fullydiluted computations of shares outstanding if the current economics ofthe deal imply that Enron will have to issue the shares in the future.This impacts 2002-2004 earnings-per-share projections only. 2. We lost value in several equity investments in 2000, $500 millionof lost value. These were fair-value investments; we wrote them down.However, we also booked gains from our price risk managementtransactions with Raptor, recording a corresponding PRM accountreceivable from the Raptor entities. That's a $500 million related partytransaction -- it's 20 percent of 2000 IBIT, 51 percent of NI pretax, 33percent of NI after tax. 3. Credit reviews the underlying capitalization of Raptor, reviewsthe contingent shares and determines whether the Raptor entities willhave enough capital to pay Enron its $500 million when the equityderivatives expire. 4. The Raptor entities are technically bankrupt; the value of thecontingent Enron shares equals or is just below the PRM account payablethat Raptor owes Enron. Raptor's inception-to-date income statement is a$500 million loss. 5. Where are the equity and debt investors that lost out? LJM iswhole on a cash-on-cash basis. Where did the $500 million in value comefrom? It came from Enron shares. Why haven't we booked the transactionas $500 million in a promise of shares to the Raptor entity and $500million of value in our ''economic interests'' in these entities? Thenwe would have a write-down of our value in the Raptor entities. We havenot booked the latter, because we do not have to yet. Technically we canwait and face the music in 2002-2004."," Wed, 16 Jan 2002 08:21",,, FW,,96666,1.210143804550171,

This is a clear violation of accounting rules and transparency, and can be considered outright fraud.

This email exhibits some questionable accounting practices and raises concerns about potential fraud. While the email does not explicitly state the intention to hide losses, the language used and the context of the situation suggest that this email is attempting to downplay the severity of the situation.

**Here are the key points that indicate potential abuse:**

* **Merging of credits:** The email mentions the merging of the credit of the four Raptors under a 45-day pact, which allowed Enron to avoid reporting a credit-reserve loss. This practice is highly questionable and could be viewed as an attempt to deceive investors.
* **Lack of transparency:** The email does not disclose the true financial position of Enron, as it focuses primarily on the accounting practices used to hide the losses. This lack of transparency is a red flag and raises concerns about the company's integrity.
* **Exaggerated claims:** The email states that the restructuring of the Raptors was ""a triumph of accounting ingenuity"" and ""perceived by many within Enron as a triumph of accounting ingenuity."" This statement is overly optimistic and does not take into account the severity of the situation.

**However, there are some mitigating factors:**

* **Skilling's involvement:** The email mentions Skilling's involvement in the restructuring of the Raptors and his statement about being informed of the matter in general terms. This suggests that Skilling may not have been intentionally trying to deceive investors.
* **Lay's knowledge:** The email mentions Lay's knowledge of the Raptors and his lack of awareness of their debts and reorganization. This suggests that Lay may not have been fully informed about the situation.

As I likely will not return to the office until just at the time of September close, I thought it might make sense for you, with Brent's assistance, to make sure that the appropriate reporting personnel are notified of the tax adjustments that should be made to book these transactions.Each of the ""top tier"" Raptor entities (Harrier, Roadrunner, Pronghorn, and Grizzly) ""purchased"" from LJM the membership interest that LJM owned in the ""bottom tier"" Raptor entities (Talon, Bobcat, Porcupine, and Timberwlf, respectively). Harrier paid $6 mil, Roadrunner and Grizzly each paid $15 mil, and Pronghorn paid $1,000. As a result of these transactions, the purchased entities became book consolidated with Enron. Also as a result of these transactions, a total book loss of around $600 mil was recorded (divided among the books of each one of the four structures). For tax purposes, the purchasing and purchased entities are all disregarded entities of Enron Corp. (or EES, in the case of Pronghorn and Porcupine). The repurchases are to be treated as merely a final payment made by Enron Corp. (or EES, as the case may be) on a contingent debt instrument. Accordingly, the entire book loss should be reversed for tax, and instead an interest deduction recorded on the tax books of each purchasing entity for the amount that was paid to purchase the bottom tier entity. For examply, Harrier will record an interest expense deduction for $6 mil. We have not been told yet exactly how the book loss will be spread among the four structures, and whether it will be booked on the top tier or bottom tier entities' books. Ron Baker likely will have an answer on this issue by the time you see this message. Please leave me a voice mail if you need assistance before I return to the office on October 10. Thanks! DMD

I am working with Essie to determine which entities will report how much of the $600 million purchase price. Thanks, John. -----Original Message-----Subject:FW: Raptor unwind tax accountingFYI -----Original Message-----Subject:Raptor unwind tax accountingEssie:The purpose of this message is to communicate to you, for co-ordination with the appropriate ""MARC"" personnel, the relevant facts of the transactions that closed on Friday, September 28, to unwind the Raptor structures. As I likely will not return to the office until just at the time of September close, I thought it might make sense for you, with Brent's assistance, to make sure that the appropriate reporting personnel are notified of the tax adjustments that should be made to book these transactions.Each of the ""top tier"" Raptor entities (Harrier, Roadrunner, Pronghorn, and Grizzly) ""purchased"" from LJM the membership interest that LJM owned in the ""bottom tier"" Raptor entities (Talon, Bobcat, Porcupine, and Timberwlf, respectively). Harrier paid $6 mil, Roadrunner and Grizzly each paid $15 mil, and Pronghorn paid $1,000. As a result of these transactions, the purchased entities became book consolidated with Enron. Also as a result of these transactions, a total book loss of around $600 mil was recorded (divided among the books of each one of the four structures). For tax purposes, the purchasing and purchased entities are all disregarded entities of Enron Corp. (or EES, in the case of Pronghorn and Porcupine). The repurchases are to be treated as merely a final payment made by Enron Corp. (or EES, as the case may be) on a contingent debt instrument. Accordingly, the entire book loss should be reversed for tax, and instead an interest deduction recorded on the tax books of each purchasing entity for the amount that was paid to purchase the bottom tier entity. For examply, Harrier will record an interest expense deduction for $6 mil. We have not been told yet exactly how the book loss will be spread among the four structures, and whether it will be booked on the top tier or bottom tier entities' books. Ron Baker likely will have an answer on this issue by the time you see this message. Please leave me a voice mail if you need assistance before I return to the office on October 10. Thanks!

Washington, Nov. 20 (Bloomberg) -- An accounting industryoversight group, prompted by concerns about Arthur Andersen LLP'sfailed audits of Enron Corp., plans to look at the adequacy ofletting U.S. audit firms police one another, said the group'schairman, Charles Bowsher. The question for the Public Oversight Board involves theindustry's system of ``peer reviews,'' in which auditors submittheir reports on public companies for examination by otheraccounting firms, in an effort to assure investors the auditscomply with accounting standards. ``How can you have peer reviews and still have these kinds offailures?'' Bowsher, a former U.S. comptroller general, asked inan interview. The board's examination will consider the broadissue of industry oversight, leaving specific review of Enron'saudits to the Securities and Exchange Commission, he said. Houston-based Enron, the largest energy trader, this monthsaid it overstated earnings by $586 million over four-and-a-halfyears, inflated shareholder equity by $1.2 billion because of anaccounting error, and failed to consolidate results of threeaffiliated partnerships into its balance sheet. The oversight board, created to supervise the accountingindustry's self-governance practices, will address the issue Dec.4, Bowsher said. Andersen, the world's fifth-largest accounting firm, wasEnron's outside auditor for more than a decade, assuring investorsthat the company's financial statements conformed with generallyaccepted accounting principles. Deloitte & Touche LLP has been thefirm assigned to do Andersen's peer reviews. Dingell Skeptical U.S. Representative John Dingell, a Michigan Democrat,questioned the peer review process yesterday in a letter toBowsher. None of the five biggest international accounting firmshas ever issued a negative peer-review report against another,Dingell said. The so-called Big Five are Andersen, Deloitte &Touche, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLC, KPMG LLP, and Ernst & YoungLP. ``There appears to be little reason for the public to havefaith in Andersen or the peer review process,'' Dingell wrote. Andersen responded that it has faith in the accountingprofession's self-regulatory process, which the POB oversees. A spokeswoman at Deloitte & Touche didn't return a telephonecall seeking comment. The oversight board was thinking of looking into peer reviewissues before receiving Dingell's letter, Bowsher said. ``But thisletter certainly focuses the issue,'' he said. Conflict of Interest? Dingell's letter said the outside counsel to a specialcommittee of Enron's board has retained Deloitte & Touche --Andersen's peer reviewer -- to help it examine the company'saccounting problems."," Tue, 20 Nov 2001 14:23",,,,,260193,1.2130831480026245,

The email does not directly indicate any abuse of accounting rules but highlights potential issues that could lead to inaccurate financial reporting if not addressed properly.","<Email Start>
The email discusses several issues that may indicate an abuse of accounting rules, including:

1. Misstated extended trial balance values due to data issues.
2. Reconciling differences between trader position analyses, AS400 on-screen inquiries, and the formal global position report.
3. The creation of an incentive payment pool for key Metals staff working unsociable hours.
4. Signoff for additional permanent 'Enron' headcount to duplicate certain key position control processes.
5. A reconciling difference of $15mm exists between the reported DPR and the final accounting P&L as generated on the AS400.
6. The recall of all OBSF stock in early April and retention on balance sheet until positions are fully reconciled and a repeatable daily signoff process can be instigated.
7. Prioritized Middle Office work, including stock circularization, audits, and position analysis.
8. Mike Jordan's approval is required for several items related to these issues.

Score: 6/10

The email discusses several accounting practices that may be questionable, such as the reconciliation of data issues, differences in position analyses, and the creation of an incentive payment pool. However, it does not explicitly state that these practices are intended to hide losses or violate accounting rules. The score is lower because some of the practices mentioned could potentially be legal and transparent, but further investigation would be needed to determine their validity.","## Score for the email: 6

This email exhibits some questionable accounting practices, but not necessarily outright fraud. The main concerns are:

* **Misstated trial balance:** The email mentions potential misstatement of OBSF values due to data issues. This could be misleading and potentially inaccurate.
* **Lack of transparency:** The email does not disclose the reasons behind the adjustments or the potential impact on financial statements.
* **Potential manipulation:** The email mentions the creation of an incentive payment pool and additional headcount, which could be seen as attempts to influence financial outcomes.

However, the email also includes some legitimate concerns and actions related to operational risk and potential misstatements. The company is investigating the issue and plans to reconcile the discrepancies. The email also includes detailed information about the company's plans for addressing the issues.

Overall, while the email exhibits some questionable practices, it does not necessarily constitute outright fraud. The score of 6 reflects the potential for manipulation and misleading information, but also the company's efforts to address the issues and improve transparency.",The email with a score of 10 indicates outright fraud as it discusses hiding losses using mark to market accounting practices and placing them on the books.

This email primarily focuses on the potential impact of new regulatory requirements on Enron's business rather than accounting practices. While the email mentions the potential for ""hiding true financial position"" through accounting practices, the tone is more concerned with the potential impact of the new regulations on the company's ability to compete rather than the potential for manipulating financial statements.

The email about EPSA conference call is also not an indication of abuse as it does not discuss any specific accounting practices or rules.","- identification of the buyer/seller;- description of the service, (e.g., purchase/sale, firm/non-firm); - delivery point(s); - price(s) (price per transaction rather than price ranges) - quantities, (e.g., MWh/MW); and - dates/duration of service (e.g., daily, monthly, hourly, etc.) Such information is supposed to be reported on a transaction by transaction (rather than aggregated) basis. The quarterly filings are paper filings and are not granted confidential treatment.The quarterly filing requirements proposed in the NOPR differ in that they would, 1) in addition to all of the above information, also require posting of the transaction execution date and the point of receipt; 2) require electronic posting of an Index of Customers rather than paper filing and 3) require reporting for all sales transactions including book outs or net outs. Enron should consider objecting to these revisions. I've spoken with some of the traders and they agree. The effect of these requirements would be that Enron's competitors will now have quicker, easier access to not only the usual reported information but also to the transaction execution date which will disclose a place and time for the transaction. FERC has cited very little valid justification for imposing these new requirements. ENA Legal representatives and I will be participating in the EPSA conference call to discuss the NOPR on Friday.

This email indicates some potential abuse of accounting rules, but not necessarily outright fraud. The email highlights the firm's admission of mistakes and their willingness to cooperate with investigations. However, the email does not provide enough information to determine the full extent of the abuse or whether it was intentional or negligent.

**Key points:**

* **Potential abuse:** The email mentions the destruction of documents related to the Enron engagement, which could be seen as an attempt to hide losses.
* **Admission of mistakes:** The firm acknowledges their mistakes and expresses their commitment to transparency and accountability.
* **Cooperation:** The firm states their willingness to cooperate fully with ongoing investigations.

**However:**

* **Lack of information:** The email does not provide enough details about the nature of the document destruction or the specific accounting rules that were violated.
* **Lack of context:** The email does not provide enough context about the firm's actions or the overall situation surrounding the Enron scandal.

The base gas deal, by comparison, was discussed in one sentence. Can we avoid making the thing look bigger than it really is by disclosing something more meaningful like VAR (which I assume would be a much smaller number)? Second, disclosing TW and NN trading activity separately makes the Transcanada deal look like a bigger thing than it really was, since the TW and NN portions offset one another. I know we need to disclose deals separately for each operating company, but is there a way things like notional value and ""fair value"" (or VAR) can be aggregated to more accurately reflect the total impact of the deal--currently it looks like both TW and NN were out doing huge commodity deals. Third, I have never been that concerned about overly broad disclosures in the noteholder reports because of the limited distribution.

Yesterday, Enron's accountants and the presidential Cabinet officers added to the scare and sent the burgeoning scandal in new directions. Arthur Andersen, the esteemed accounting firm, admitted it had destroyed Enron documents. That's bad, but what Arthur Andersen says it doesn't know may be worse. It says the records included ""a significant but undetermined number of electronic and paper documents and correspondence."" The firm goes on to say, ""After receiving [an] SEC subpoena, the firm issued an instruction to preserve documents."" What, one wonders, was Andersen's ""instruction"" before it received the subpoena--to destroy Enron documents with abandon? Did the accountants comply with the directive to preserve the documents? Andersen doesn't know: ""At this time, we have not been able to determine whether that instruction was violated,"" the firm says in a statement. Andersen says it has ""also asked former U.S. Sen. John Danforth to conduct an immediate and comprehensive review of Andersen's records management policy and to recommend improvements."" It does not say how much it is paying Danforth for his counsel, but it can have this policy tip for nothing: Don't destroy documents related to a scandal that led to a bankruptcy that wiped out $70 billion in shareholder value. These unanswered questions are part of a pattern with Enron. No one really knows how it got so rich, or what it was doing with the many private partnerships managed by its executives. No one knows what prompted former Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling to quit the company in August 2001. Indeed, at a bankruptcy court hearing earlier this week, it was revealed that Enron does not know the location of 79 of its top executives or even if they still work for the company. Separately, the White House revealed that Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman, called Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Don Evans to warn them of the company's looming bankruptcy. This disclosure came with an additional announcement that Attorney General John Ashcroft has recused himself from the criminal investigation of Enron because of contributions he's received from company executives. Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary, said Lay telephoned O'Neill amid Enron's collapse ""to advise him about his concern about the obligations of Enron and whether they would be able to meet those obligations.''

The email expresses concerns about conflicts of interest in accounting firms, the need to strengthen accounting rules, and the limitations of investment choices in 401(k) plans. It does not contain any direct evidence or indication of Enron specifically hiding losses or abusing accounting rules using mark-to-market accounting or the Raptor Special Purpose Entity (SBE). The email focuses on systemic issues and proposed solutions rather than specific instances of fraudulent activities.","<Email Start>Part of the problem is the conflict of interest that has developed as accounting firms have moved more heavily into corporate consulting. Many are simply afraid to jeopardize lucrative consulting deals by issuing critical audits. Washington should tackle this conflict of interest by forcing these firms to divest their consulting operations. Accounting rules also need to be strengthened so that reports to shareholders and regulators accurately portray earnings and risks. For years, Enron was able to inflate its profits by concealing debts in a string of ""off-balance-sheet"" transactions. While some of this may have been done improperly, current rules do allow companies to hide debts and other obligations. Even Wall Street analysts were unable to figure out Enron's statements. No one knows how many Enron-type time bombs are ticking at other companies. But if the accounting rules permit deception, it's sure to take place. And if the public concludes that corporate financial statements are not to be trusted, confidence in the stock and bond markets is sure to be undermined. Finally, it's already clear that 401(k) retirement plans need major reform. Thousands of Enron employees' retirement accounts were devastated when the company's share price fell from $90 to less than $1. Company rules had prevented most employees from selling Enron shares held in 401(k)s, even though Enron executives were locking in fortunes by unloading shares as the company's troubles mounted. Bills recently introduced in Congress would limit employees' risk by placing a cap on the amount of the employer's stock that could be held in 401(k)s or by giving employees the right to sell those shares. While that would be an improvement, it wouldn't resolve the broader problem - that investment choices in most 401(k) plans are just too limited. Particpants are left with too many eggs in too few baskets, an especially serious problem if the boss offers poor investment choices. There's a simple solution: 401(k)s should be changed to work like individual retirement accounts, allowing participants unlimited investment choices. Because Enron was so big - the seventh-largest U.S. corporation at its height - it's tempting to see this mess as unique. In fact, political influence peddling, accounting shenanigans, and abuse of employees and shareholders are widespread. Perhaps the Enron case is big enough to produce some sorely needed systemic change.

The email does not explicitly mention hiding losses or engaging in fraudulent accounting practices. However, it is clear that the company is preserving documents related to litigation involving the LJM partnerships, which could potentially reveal information about the company's financial position and any related party transactions. The fact that the normal document destruction policies are suspended until further notice suggests that there may be something unusual or potentially problematic about these transactions. Therefore, I would score this email as having a moderate potential for abuse of accounting rules, with a score of 8 out of 10.","## Score for the email: 2

This email falls into the category of ""potentially abusive accounting practices"" with a score of 2 out of 10. While it does mention the ongoing litigation and the requirement to preserve documents related to the LJM partnerships, the tone and language used suggest an attempt to downplay the severity of the situation and potentially mislead stakeholders. 

**Here's why:**

* **Lack of transparency:** The email does not explicitly state whether the company is experiencing financial difficulties or if the losses are significant.
* **Misleading statements:** The email claims that the accounting practices are ""100% legal and trasparent,"" which is inaccurate. Mark-to-market accounting can be complex and difficult to understand, and it is not always clear whether the practices are truly transparent.
* **Emphasis on litigation:** The email spends a lot of time discussing the ongoing litigation and the document preservation requirements, but does not provide much information about the potential impact of the losses on the company or its shareholders.

Overall, while this email does mention the requirement to preserve documents related to the litigation, the tone and language used suggest an attempt to downplay the severity of the situation and potentially mislead stakeholders. Therefore, it receives a score of 2 out of 10.","The email that indicates an abuse of accounting rules is the one where they placed loses in a SBE called Raptors to hide them from investors.

While the email does not explicitly state the intention to hide losses, the content and tone suggest that it may be attempting to deceive. 

**Here's the breakdown:**

* **Misleading statements:** The email claims that the accounting practices are ""100% legal and trasparent,"" which is inaccurate. Mark-to-market accounting can be complex and difficult to understand, and it is not necessarily transparent.
* **Lack of disclosure:** The email does not disclose the specific losses that are being hidden or the impact that they will have on the company's financial position.
* **Confusing language:** The email uses jargon and technical language that may be difficult for some readers to understand, making it difficult to assess the potential impact of the accounting practices.

However, the email does not contain any evidence of deliberate fraud or manipulation of financial records. It primarily focuses on the technical aspects of accounting practices and the need to comply with loan agreements. Therefore, the score is 6, indicating potential abuse of accounting rules but not outright fraud.","The email with the subject ""Re: More stuff"" does not indicate any abuse of accounting rules as it is a standard practice in the industry. The email with the subject ""FYI"" also does not indicate any abuse of accounting rules as it discusses the use of mark-to-market accounting practices that are legal and transparent. However, the email with the subject ""Re: More stuff"" indicates some level of fraudulent activity as it discusses an autoborrow facility where Enron's cash flow is swept into an account and advances are made directly to the account based on the company's cash position. This practice may be legal, but it is not transparent and could potentially hide losses from investors. The email with the subject ""Re: More stuff"" also discusses a loan agreement that is prime rate-based, which indicates that Enron may have been using this facility to borrow money at a lower interest rate than what they would normally pay on their debt. This practice may be legal, but it could potentially hide losses from investors as well. Overall, the emails indicate some level of fraudulent activity and abuse of accounting rules, but it is difficult to determine the extent of the abuse without further investigation.","Subject: Re: More stuffFYI.

If I deciphered this correctly, this is going to be what I would call an ""autoborrow"" facility ... Enovate's cash flow is swept into an account. Each day: (i) if Enovate's cash position is short (and availability remains under the loan agreements) advances are made under each loan agreement (probably directly into the acount), and (ii) if Enovate's position is long, the positive balance of the account is applied towards the outstanding loan balances, if any. We'll need to get minimum target amounts (i.e., do you really want them paying down $1.00 of each loan?) from the business people.Based on the foregoing, I suspect that these will be single-lender, prime rate based loan agreements (otherwise it would be a huge operational headache).

Accrual accounting for energy trading contracts, which has been replaced by mark-to-market in most circumstances, provides more opportunities for fraud, manipulation and deception. --------------------------------------------------------------POWER FUTURES ?| Month | COB | Change | PV | Change || MAR | 20.00 | +0.00 | 22.50 | +0.00 || APR | 20.25 | +0.00 | 24.00 | +0.00 || MAY | 19.75 | +0.00 | 25.00 | +0.00 || JUN | 21.00 | +0.00 | 28.50 | +0.00 || JUL | 28.75 | +0.50 | 39.75 | +0.00 || AUG | 37.50 | +0.00 | 45.25 | +0.00 || SEP | 33.50 | +0.00 | 34.50 | +0.00 || OCT | 29.50 | +0.00 | 29.50 | +0.00 || NOV | 29.00 | +0.00 | 28.50 | +0.00 || DEC | 30.50 | +0.00 | 29.00 | +0.00 || JAN | 30.50 | +0.00 | 29.50 | +0.00 || FEB | 29.00 | +0.00 | 29.00 | +0.00 || Month | Entergy | Change | Cinergy | Change || MAR | 20.00 | +0.00 | 21.10 | +0.00 || APR | 20.00 | +0.00 | 21.60 | +0.00 || MAY | 22.50 | +0.00 | 24.70 | +0.00 || JUN | 27.50 | +0.00 | 30.00 | +0.00 || JUL | 34.50 | +0.00 | 38.25 | +0.00 || AUG | 34.50 | +0.00 | 38.25 | +0.00 || SEP | 21.50 | +0.00 | 22.90 | +0.00 || OCT | 21.85 | +0.00 | 22.90 | +0.00 || NOV | 21.85 | +0.00 | 22.90 | +0.00 || DEC | 21.85 | +0.00 | 22.90 | +0.00 || JAN | 24.10 | +0.00 | 25.90 | +0.00 || FEB | 24.10 | +0.00 | 25.90 | +0.00 |------------------------------------------------------------Power Futures | Month | PJM | Change || MAR | 25.10 | +0.00 || APR | 25.10 | +0.00 || MAY | 28.25 | +0.00 || JUN | 35.00 | +0.00 || JUL | 46.15 | +0.00 || AUG | 46.15 | +0.00 || SEP | 27.15 | +0.00 || OCT | 26.00 | +0.00 || NOV | 26.00 | +0.00 || DEC | 26.00 | +0.00 || JAN | 30.25 | +0.00 || FEB | 30.25 | +0.00 |-------------------------------------------------------------Marketers Say Derivative Bill Goes to Far"," Tue, 19 Feb 2002 22:08",,,,,494686,1.2234270572662354,

Effective with March flow, each desks for Central and East will record to its own profit center in SAP (the wellhead desks and Texas were done in Feb.'s g/l). According to Gas Acct., they will calculate UA for each of the profit centers (19 in total). As we discussed, VM does not have the appropriate Unify reports or manpower to support this level of accounting at this time and for this month will continue to tie UA4 out as we have in the past using our same reports - Gas Acct. will have to sum their side of the UA4 calc. to match us. With the foresight of eventually going to profit center level accouting and reporting, there will need to be significant changes to our current back end systems and processes to handle this lower level of reporting. I believe the flash is already being done at the different profit centers, but all the downstream groups are still performing their analysis at a more consolidated level. There were discussions in the meeting that OA would not go to this lower level, but I am of the opinion that we all need to be consistent in our analysis and reporting across the organization - so if this is the path we take, then everyone's process will need to be able to handle this level of detail. Of course, no decisions were made in our meeting, and as I stated, for now, VM's process will remain unchanged for this month. Please let me know if you want to discuss further.

Enron collapsed after reporting strong profits for years, a fact that might= be seen as proof that the profits were illusory.=20But even some accountants who are extremely critical of Enron's accounting =now say that accounting rules -- including one that was influenced by Enron= when it was being written -- give at least a veneer of acceptability to so=me of the most widely questioned Enron accounting practices.''It's conceivable that they complied with the rules,'' said Douglas Carmic=hael, a professor of accountancy at Baruch College. ''Absent a smoking-gun =e-mail or something similar, it is an issue of trying to attack the reasona=bleness of the assumptions they made.''=20The Enron case highlights a weakness in the system that exists to encourage= companies to fairly describe their financial health: when accounting rules= are written very specifically, clever accountants find ways to get around =them. When, as in this case, they are written far more generally, proper ac=counting can be overly reliant on the good faith of companies and auditors =in applying the rules.=20As a result, the evidence that the Justice Department and the Securities an=d Exchange Commission would need to bring fraud charges would be documents =showing that accountants made estimates they knew to be unreasonable. To fi=nd such evidence, investigators would review internal memorandums and e-mai=l messages. But some of those appear to have been destroyed by employees of= Enron and its former auditor, Arthur Andersen.=20The rule in question concerned trading in the energy business.

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to follow up on our recent discussion regarding the storage model index and the financial product we have developed with Raptors SBE. As you know, we have been using mark-to-market accounting for these assets, which has allowed us to recognize revenue as profit.

I understand your concerns about transparency and accountability, and I want to assure you that our practices are 100% legal and transparent. We have taken great care to ensure that we are in compliance with all relevant regulations and guidelines.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.

The email does not explicitly mention hiding losses or engaging in fraudulent activities. However, it is important to note that the use of mark-to-market accounting can be a contentious issue, and some may view it as an attempt to hide losses.

**Reasoning:**

This email exhibits some concerning practices, but not necessarily outright fraud. The email mentions ""mark to market accounting"" and ""Raptor SBE,"" which are red flags associated with Enron's accounting scandal. However, the email does not provide enough context or details to determine whether the practices described are truly fraudulent. The email score of 8 reflects the potential for abuse of accounting rules, but not necessarily the actual commission of fraud.

**Key Factors:**

* **Mention of ""mark to market accounting"" and ""Raptor SBE"":** These terms are associated with Enron's accounting scandal and raise red flags.
* **Lack of context:** The email does not provide enough details or context to determine whether the practices described are truly fraudulent.
* **Potential for abuse:** The email describes practices that could be viewed as abusive accounting practices, but does not necessarily constitute fraud.

While the email does exhibit some concerning practices, it does not necessarily indicate outright fraud. The score of 8 reflects the potential for abuse of accounting rules, but not necessarily the actual commission of fraud.","The first email is a 10 on the scale of 0 to 10.

This email indicates potential accounting malpractice but not necessarily outright fraud. The email highlights the potential issue of ""hidden"" assets and claims not properly captured in the compliance system. While the email mentions the possibility of fraud, it does not provide evidence or intent to deceive. Therefore, the score is 6, indicating potential abuse of accounting rules but not necessarily fraudulent activity.

**Key points:**

* **Potential for misleading financial statements:** The email acknowledges the possibility of inaccurate financial statements due to the potential existence of hidden assets.
* **Lack of transparency:** The email emphasizes the lack of transparency in the current system, highlighting the need for a review of all current and disposed assets.
* **No evidence of intent to deceive:** Despite the potential for misleading financial statements, there is no evidence in the email to suggest that the author intends to deceive.
* **Call for further investigation:** The email calls for further investigation and review of the assets and procedures to ensure accuracy and transparency.

The loss of thousands of e-mails and files could have provided valuable insight into the events leading up to Enron's bankruptcy. The fact that the memo was issued just four days before Enron revealed a $618 million loss is also suspicious. The SEC had already begun its investigation at this point. Andersen's supervisors repeatedly reminding employees of the memo prior to the issuance of subpoenas by the SEC suggests that there may have been an attempt to cover up wrongdoing. Enron paid Andersen $25 million last year for its audit and $27 million for consulting fees and other matters. The fact that Enron's chief accounting officer and its CFO previously worked for Andersen raises additional concerns about the independence of Andersen's audits. The settlements in lawsuits brought by shareholders against Andersen, as well as the company's financial troubles, suggest that Andersen may have been complicit in Enron's accounting practices.

This email exhibits some concerning practices, but not necessarily outright fraud. The author uses strong language and makes exaggerated claims about the potential losses of investing in Cisco and other companies. However, the email does not provide any evidence to support these claims, and it does not appear to be primarily focused on providing financial advice. The author's primary goal seems to be to promote their own investment services and strategies.

**Here's a breakdown of the email:**

* **Subject:** ""Is Cisco the Next Enron???"": This subject line is attention-grabbing and misleading. It suggests that the email will discuss the potential dangers of investing in Cisco, but it does not.
* **Content:** The email begins by discussing the Enron scandal and how it has led to concerns about accounting practices. However, it does not provide any evidence to support these claims. The author then discusses their own investment strategies and how they have profited from selling high-flying stocks.
* **Conclusion:** The email ends by promoting the author's investment services and strategies. It does not provide any advice on how to invest money or make financial decisions.

Overall, this email is more about self-promotion than providing financial advice. While the author does mention some concerns about accounting practices, these concerns are not well-supported by evidence. The email also includes a lot of exaggerated claims about potential losses and profits.

However, this does not mean that Cisco is engaging in any wrongdoings or abusing accounting rules.","Subject: Is Cisco the Next Enron???Dear Investor,Did you check out the January 21st cover story ofBusinessWeek?If not, it's a MUST-READ for any investor in this ageof misinformation. You see, the Enron debacle is justthe tip of the iceberg waiting to tear a huge hole inyour retirement dreams. That's because super-aggressive accounting techniques -- even when,strictly speaking, not illegal -- have in many casesdrastically overstated how well certain companies havereally done.And particularly now -- in a tough economic test thatmost businesses are failing -- the temptation to useSMOKE-AND-MIRROR accounting is stronger than everbefore.THAT'S WHY YOU must be very, very fussy about thestocks you own today. And in just a moment, I'llintroduce you to my time-tested strategy thatidentifies the true EARNINGS MONSTERS with laser-likefocus...and helps you avoid all the earnings dogs.Enron, after all, was a huge disaster -- one with manylegal issues still to be decided. But there are manymore ""earnings traps"" set to snare unwary investors.TAKE CISCO, for example. The BusinessWeek articlequotes Michael Porter of Harvard Business School assaying, ""We will likely find that even during its so-called heyday, Cisco wasn't nearly as profitable...asmany believed.""Today, Cisco CEO John Chambers is still saying, ""Ibelieve the best years are in front of us."" Butthat's a bet I wouldn't make. Cisco isn't going todisappear like Enron. But with analysts beginning totake a harder look at REAL EARNINGS, it's verydoubtful that Cisco can grow fast enough to justifyits huge market cap.And once traders take an ax to the stock, you couldlose 30%, 40%, 50% virtually overnight.FRANKLY, I had concerns about Cisco's future two yearsago. That's why I told clients of my Blue Chip Growthadvisory to sell and lock in our 201% gains. Andsince we sold, the stock has already dropped 59%Of course, Cisco isn't the only high-flyer we dumpedbefore Wall Street caught on to the growing earningsproblem. We dumped EMC in the year 2000 and pocketed466% gains. We BANKED 189% GAINS from Home Depot;179% in Amgen; 113% in Wal-Mart; 196% in VodafoneAirtouch; and 316% in Nokia. 156% in Lucent.We owned them all while they were STILL EARNINGSMONSTERS -- and sold them before they collapsed.That's why I urge you to invest the way we do at BlueChip Growth. It's simply the SAFEST WAY to HUNT FORPROFITS -- in any kind of market.AS YOU'LL SEE, we don't own companies that might dookay when the economy recovers. We only own companiesthat are EARNINGS MONSTERS right now:*Our Forest Labs recently hit its all-time high.Since then, it has pulled back slightly, but thisgeneric drug-maker has RISEN 64% since late March.That's just what the doctor ordered!*I've been pounding the table about Peoplesoft formonths now.

However, Settlements and Billing report through Evan Hughes (EES). As such, the reconciliation process (Wes Colwell and Wade Stubblefield) is held hostage to any piece that breaks down. In this structure we (ENA) are able to control the progress and performance of Deal Capture and Risk Reporting. We are making progress on these fronts. We are completely out of the loop re: current state of affairs on the billing side (other than it just doesn't work). We are also out of the loop in assuring the proper approach and solutions are being implemented. According to Anthony Dayao and other, there are approximately 11 different billing systems that feed CSC (we outsource billing to CSC apparently). Billing Group spent several months attempting to scope out the process and future requirements. This was done in conjunction with Union Finosa. I think that approximately $6.8 MM has been spent to date on this effort w/ Union Finosa (Anthony, is this accurate). Union Fin recently provided the group with a proposal and Anthony has negotiated 60 - 90 days to review and respond (Apparently, Billing wanted to go forward with just one week of comments). Bottom Line: this does not appear to be the proper approach to ensuring that we are solving our comprehensive billing/settlement issues as well as near term necessities.PROPOSED SOLUTION:Billing/Settlements should report to Sally Beck (dotted lines to ENA and EES)EES can maintain customer interface through call centers and logo on invoiceConvene an immediate meeting with Evan Hughes, Anthony Dayao et. al. to summarize current state (including Union Fenosa)Retain Accenture or KPMG to fully scope out current reality vs. business needsImplement action plan to address long term solution vs short term necessity.Until we can resolve this, I am afraid that 1) decisions are being made without full consideration of ENA's view of business needs and 2) ENA cannot be accountable for when and if we can ever provide monthly reconciliations and flash to actuals. As we all recognize, unless you can reconcile the books, you really don't have a legitimate business.John, could we convene a meeting if necessary for you to address these issues.

Subject: 2001 Andersen Audits
Attached below are the 2001 Andersen business audits and the timeline for these audits and other work. Within this document, we have identified the EES owner(s) that will be involved in each business audit. The scope/objectives of each business audit have also been outlined.
Business Audit Approach
For each business audit, we plan to hold an opening and closing meeting with all key personnel involved for that project (includes business owners, CAO, EAS representative, and Andersen). The objectives of the opening meeting are to discuss specific audit areas, team members, key contacts, and to identify required EES documentation. The closing meeting will be critical as this is the final opportunity to ensure all facts surrounding any issues are agreed upon and initially discuss any action plans. Timing of the opening/closing meetings will be communicated by Andersen at a later date.
Please review the attached Andersen document to ensure the business owners have been properly identified. Please contact me with any revisions or other questions.
Thanks,
Misty

**Explanation:**

While this email does not explicitly attempt to hide losses, it does highlight accomplishments that may be misleading. The email focuses on systems and processes implemented to improve reporting and control, rather than the financial impact of those changes. The tone is also very positive and emphasizes the team's accomplishments, rather than the company's financial standing. However, the email does not provide enough information about the company's financial position to determine whether the accomplishments are truly significant or if they are simply a result of inflated reporting.

**Key Points:**

* **Lack of Transparency:** The email does not disclose any financial information or data about the company's position, making it difficult to assess the true impact of the accomplishments.
* **Focus on Process Over Substance:** The email primarily focuses on the implementation of systems and processes, rather than the financial impact of those changes.

Financial and physical confirmations (with the exception of Lumber) have been predominantly automated. Financial settlements has been automated. Implemented modified versions of LISA to handle physical movements and settlements. Bridges have been built to SAP and Credit Aggregation systems.People - Ten months ago, the mid and back office had three employees, with the remaining efforts supported by Global Markets. Today, we have an enthusiastic, energetic team of 41 employees. The team includes our London office also. We continue to recruit for additional positions.Processes and Controls - Many processes and controls have been developed to ensure accurate and timely reporting of P&L and positions, confirmations and settlements. Some of these tools include:Pulp and Paper Deal Ticket (Access Database) - Ten months ago, deal tickets were generated through an Excel template and no master copy or controls were in place. Today, traders, Risk, Confirms, Settlements, Credit, Logistics, etc. can view the deal tickets in a controlled and timely manner.LISA/TAGG Reconciliation (Access Database) - When the onset of physical business and the implementation of LISA systems, physical transactions for all commodities (except lumber) are entered into 2 systems - LISA and TAGG. This tool provides a reconciliation tool that allows the Risk system and the logistics/settlements systems to stay in sync.Trader Training Tools - Two different presentations have been developed and presented to the EIM trading community to help the traders (mostly new to Enron) understand the roles and responsibilities of traders, segregation of duties and the processes within Commercial Support functions such as Credit, Tax, Legal, Operations, Logistics, etc.Sally, I hope this will give the flavor of the focused efforts. Additionally, as I have had a few hours to reflect on our conversation, I would like to follow-up with an additional meeting. I need just a bit more clarity around the EIM role, but more so, I want to move forward to discuss the new role and in your view, how I can still accomplish the successes that coincide with my personal goals.If you have time tomorrow afternonn, I would really appreciate 30 minutes.Thanks for your support.

FASB Adds Performance Reporting Project, Defers Intangible Assets Disclosure Decision
BNA - October 25, 2001
NORWALK, Conn.--The Financial Accounting Standards Board Oct. 24 formally added a project on performance reporting to its rulemaking agenda, but it deferred a decision on whether to start a separate standard-setting effort on disclosures about intangible assets. The topic of intangibles was the subject of extended debate among FASB's seven members as they weighed its importance in allocating staff resources to such a project or to two other issues vying for the attention of rulemakers. FASB heard arguments from one board member, John Wulff, suggesting that an effort to simplify and codify standards and other guidance that form statements of generally accepted principles, together with writing standards on revenue recognition and defining liability, may be more suitable candidates for rulemaking. Major U.S. corporations, through at least one trade group, the Institute of Management Accountants, counseled the course described by Wulff, a former leader of Financial Executive International's Committee on Corporate Reporting. That committee opposes FASB's taking on the performance reporting and intangibles projects as outlined in a prospectus issued about two months ago. FASB settled on a compromise plan offered by board Chairman Edmund Jenkins.
In the compromise, the panel's staff will carry out further preparatory work on intangible assets. At the same time, FASB's staff will study the three potential projects--revenue recognition and liability definition, simplification and codification of accounting rules, and disclosures about intangibles--with an eye toward deciding an appropriate use of staff accountants' time. The additional work on intangibles is to focus on summarizing existing research on such non-concrete assets as in-process research and development, patents, and customer lists, with particular focus on questions about what information on intangibles is useful to investors, security analysts, and other users of financial statements. FASB would not carry out polling or surveys, the board emphasized. The board tentatively set a deadline of Dec. 24 for completion of the two-pronged work by its staff. That timetable would suggest FASB plans to make a more definitive decision on adding a second, or even a third, standard-setting project in early 2002.

How are you? Hope you're doing well. We having been working on a storage problem that Philip as given us the framework for. In working out the details, we've come across a few questions that we know you can help us answer. I've included Philip's description of this problem in the word doc below, just for reference. 1) In Philip's document, he lists discount factors over the months. We understand that since the users are making storage decisions and hedging future months, they need to take time value of money into account. What is actually being discounted? Is it NYMEX? Is it prices of the instruments? How does that factor into user's storage decisions? 2) In our problem, we ask the user to fill out a storage schedule and then select instruments to hedge positions created by the storage. In our other scenarios we have initial and natural position split out into the Enron risk buckets (Price, Index, Basis, GD) and have users choose the appropriate hedging instruments based on the risk areas the instruments cover. In this storage scenario, the only positions created are by storage decisions. What risk bucket would storage create a position in? My thoughts are that if the only positions created are by storage, then would the user really need only 1 type of instrument to hedge their risks? Thanks in advance for your help, Dutch!

While most of what we do iscontained within Enron's electronic systems, there still are times whenhardcopies are made or needed for running our business. Here is how you musthandle those hard copy documents:1. The basic rule is that if you have hard copies of documents that areused in EPMI's business of selling energy in the WSCC, you must keep thosedocuments until further notice. If space becomes a problem, please contactDebra Davidson who can arrange for storage.2. What constitutes a document? In some instances you will have onecopy of a document that has your handwritten notes on it, and another copy thatmay be clean. For these purposes both are considered documents and both mustbe saved. Similarly, if several people have copies of the samedocument, each separate copy is considered a separate document. On theother hand, if you made 10 copies for a meeting and there were 4 left overthat were never handed out or were not used, those may be recycled so longas you keep the ones that were used. If you keep handwritten notes foryour work, those would be considered documents as well. Telephone notes,charts, printouts of data, spreadsheets etc. all constitute documents. Ifyou have a question about what constitutes a document and whether it shouldbe saved, please ask Christian Yoder and Steve Hall.3. The goal and purpose of this policy is to make sure that no hardcopies ofdocuments are discarded that are relevant to the wholesale electricity marketlitigation. If hard copy documents are discarded, at alater point in time EPMIand/or its employees will be criticized for failingto preserve documents relevant to the wholesale electricity litigation.4.

While most of what we do iscontained within Enron's electronic systems, there still are times whenhardcopies are made or needed for running our business. Here is how you musthandle those hard copy documents:1. The basic rule is that if you have hard copies of documents that areused in EPMI's business of selling energy in the WSCC, you must keep thosedocuments until further notice. If space becomes a problem, please contactDebra Davidson who can arrange for storage.2. What constitutes a document? In some instances you will have onecopy of a document that has your handwritten notes on it, and another copythat may be clean. For these purposes both are considered documents andboth must be saved. Similarly, if several people have copies of the samedocument, each separate copy is considered a separate document. On theother hand, if you made 10 copies for a meeting and there were 4 left overthat were never handed out or were not used, those may be recycled so longas you keep the ones that were used. If you keep handwritten notes foryour work, those would be considered documents as well. Telephone notes,charts, printouts of data, spreadsheets etc. all constitute documents. Ifyou have a question about what constitutes a document and whether it shouldbe saved, please ask Christian Yoder and Steve Hall.3. The goal and purpose of this policy is to make sure that no hardcopies of documents are discarded that are relevant to the wholesaleelectricity market litigation. If hard copy documents are discarded, at alater point in time EPMI and/or its employees will be criticized forfailingto preserve documents relevant to the wholesale electricity litigation.4.

When a deal is killed in CPR, the detail record gets deleted. Consequently, when CPRReader picks up the change, it has no idea what the start and end dates for the record are, and doesn't publish anything for those values. When Deal Ticker gets the deal, it uses the ""0"" date, Dec 30, 1899 for the start and end dates.
Possible fixes would include having Deal Ticker just not display dates when they're not known, or having the CPR triggers put the start and end dates in the TDS table when a deal is killed.

2. The accounting for FGT/FP&L $1.5mm settlement - This item appears to be a liability and should be recorded at its face value.
3. Citrus/ENA/Bridgeline gas sale/purchase - This item requires proper accounting treatment as it involves the sale of assets. The gain or loss on the sale should be reflected in the income statement.
4. TW 2002 fuel sales - This item also requires proper accounting treatment as it involves revenue recognition. The revenue should be recognized when the fuel is delivered to the customer.
5. Bolivia investment - This item requires proper accounting treatment as it involves an investment in another entity. The investment should be recorded at its cost and any changes in value should be reflected in other comprehensive income.
6. TW PCB remediation for PG&E - This item requires proper accounting treatment as it involves a liability for future expenses. The liability should be recorded at its present value and any changes in the fair value should be reflected in the income statement.
7. NNG(?) depreciation study - This item requires proper accounting treatment as it involves an asset that is subject to depreciation. The depreciation expense should be recognized over the useful life of the asset.
8. Machine shop accounting - This item requires proper accounting treatment as it involves a segment of the company's operations. The revenue and expenses related to this segment should be reflected in the income statement.
9. Accounting for residual SAP costs - This item requires proper accounting treatment as it involves costs associated with a software system. The costs should be capitalized and amortized over the useful life of the system.
10. EOTT related reserve reversal - This item requires proper accounting treatment as it involves a change in an estimate. The change should be reflected in the income statement.
11. EOTT/Enron pipeline services operating agreement - This item requires proper accounting treatment as it involves a contract with another entity. The revenue and expenses related to this contract should be recognized over the term of the agreement.

**Email Score:** 2

**Reasoning:**

This email primarily focuses on issues related to email storage and backup, rather than accounting practices. While the email mentions the potential for data corruption and the need for backups, it does not relate these issues to the topic of accounting practices or the potential abuse of accounting rules. Therefore, the score of 2 is assigned, indicating that the email does not constitute outright fraud or abuse of accounting rules, but it does raise concerns about the potential for data corruption and the need for proper backups.","The email with the score of 10 indicates an abuse of accounting rules as it suggests hiding losses using mark to market accounting so revenue was realized as profit. The email with a score of 0 does not indicate any abuse of accounting rules as it discusses the legal and transparent nature of the accounting practices at Enron. The email with a score of 10 indicates that the news about the accounting practices at Enron discuss derivatives and mark to market accounting, but it does not suggest an abuse of accounting rules.","My first step was to do a reality check, which showed me that Iam part of the problem. My own inbox currently contains 504items, including 192 that are unread, and when I sort on the""created"" field, I find some of my mail goes back to July. Byalmost anyone's standards, as far as e-mail is concerned I amnot a very good citizen. Fortunately my IT manager, a good guyif there ever was one, provides me with all the data protectionI need.My thinking is this. A sound backup rotation, with tapesregularly moving to offsite storage, plus an up-to-date logbookin a fireproof safe, will make locating the correct tape fairlyeasy. The trick, of course, is to keep the log current. Allthis is pretty obvious, but I wonder how many of you actuallydocument the content and movement of each tape?But what if you need to do more than just document the problemof tape glut? If you want to cure the disease rather than justtreat the symptoms, there are several vendors out thereoffering useful solutions.The main issue, as far as e-mail is concerned, is that theinformation store holding all the data is treated by theapplication as a monolithic block. Because of this, you can'tdo an efficient incremental backup, and even if only a singlemessage has been changed or corrupted, you still have to backup the entire file. Potentially, you might have to back up a5G-byte file to account for a 500K-byte change in the data.Now, new application-savvy software can help out by providingsnapshotting capabilities for the Exchange (or Notes) Server.For example, FalconStor (http://www.falconstor.com ) is about toannounce a product that will allow you to set a regimen of timedsnapshots that would provide the functional equivalent ofincremental backups of the e-mail information store.With snapshots, data is addressed in block rather than filemode. Thus, you can look for (and save) only those sectors ofthe file that show a change. Because your tapes capture onlythe blocks containing changed data, less data is transferredand fewer tapes are needed. The result of hourly snapshotsmight be 24 files of 2M-bytes each, rather than a single dailybackup of the whole multigigabyte file. And to make my friendRoberto happy, it could all be captured on a single tape.Unless you are media manufacturers, you should like that._______________________________________________________________To contact Mike Karp:"," Tue, 20 Nov 2001 18:00",,,,,212248,1.2403342723846436,

The email discusses an internal approach to controlling the wholesale trading businesses, focusing on accountability for internal controls and a culture of control and operational risk assessment. It mentions the importance of communication and measurement, as well as leveraging the work engaged by staff in the line. The approach also includes defining output from different elements of implementing, completing, and reviewing internal control. While the email does not explicitly mention hiding losses or using mark-to-market accounting, it does emphasize a culture of control and risk assessment, which could potentially be used to hide losses if not implemented correctly.

It has been a continual challenge as you well know. The good news is the individual from EES (Chris Luttrell) accepted Jay's offer today and he is going to start on March 3. That said, I talked to Chris today and filled him in on where we are and what we want to accomplish. He feels our best option will be Oracle. To ensure we are prepared for his arrival next Monday, we are preparing the detail of what we are doing today, both our assumptions and all of the various data sources for our current management reporting
Also, Dave and I met with Wanda and Georgeanne on Tuesday regarding revenue. I believe Dave sent you an update of this meeting. We are meeting with Georgeanne today to go over our assumptions, conversions, etc. to ensure that we are consistent with those conversations in the annual report, and to ensure that we are capturing all of the Enron data
Customer database - we have been fine tuning this all week, and I think we are about there. There are still some minor differences, but we are working to sort through these today (everyone is involved in the tie out). I will review the new report format with you on Monday and we will start sending this out then
We also have an Access person that is working on improving our current database since we will have to live with this in the short term.
TRADING ACTIVITY:
It seems that we are seeing an increase in customers wanting to modify EOL deals for various reasons (one being Web latency...they are claiming that the deal did not show up on their transaction summary, so they thought it did not go through, and they did another deal...and this first deal appeared sometime later). We have continued to emphasize the importance of not changing these deals after they are completed, but despite this, it is still happening. I am going to try and track down Jeff Shankman this afternoon to discuss.
We are also seeing more and more customers trading under the wrong entities...for example, Aquila Risk Mgmt is executing physical deals, when they should be only executing financial deals. From my understanding, we have ""left the door open"" for them to trade either way and are relying on them to trade under the correct counterparty. This is causing several problems downstream..for instance, customers are wanting ENA to send modified invoices with the name of the correct counterparty (despite the fact that they were the ones transacting under the wrong entity). We need to discuss how leaving this door open affects our downstream processes.

Subject: Re: Update...while you were out

I have reviewed the email you sent and I must say that I am concerned about the accounting practices being discussed. It seems that we are using mark to market accounting to hide losses, which could be viewed as an abuse of the accounting rules. I believe that this practice is not transparent and could potentially lead to fraud if not properly managed.

I would like to request a thorough investigation into these accounting practices to ensure that they are in compliance with all regulations and standards. It is important that we maintain transparency and integrity in our financial reporting.

Please let me know your thoughts on this matter and what steps we can take to address it.

The email describes in detail how Enron and its accountants abused accounting rules, specifically mark-to-market accounting and Special Purpose Entities (SBEs) named Raptors, to hide losses and realize revenue as profit. This manipulation of financial statements was essential for Enron's executives to enrich themselves while hiding the true financial position from investors and regulators. The email provides clear evidence of fraudulent activities.","<Email Start>
The original raptors were fierce creatures that hunted in packs and managed to bring down larger dinosaurs, which they then devoured. Now the special report of the Enron board committee has clarified just how four entities known as Raptors played an essential role in destroying Enron. It is a tale of how accounting rules can be abused and insiders enriched. The report traces the delicate machinery that was used by Enron's accountants. There appears to have been, at least for a time, a tortured interpretation of accounting rules that could be used to justify the hiding of $1 billion in losses. But that smokescreen would have been completely unsuccessful had auditors from Arthur Andersen forced the company to disclose what was happening, as they should have done. Those disclosures would have made it clear that there was no economic rationale for the transactions, and thus no reason to think that Enron had earned nearly as much money as it said it did. Over 15 months, from the beginning of the third quarter of 2000 through the third quarter of 2001, Enron reported pretax profits of $1.5 billion. Had Enron not used the Raptor artifices, the figure would have been 72 percent lower: $429 million. The accounting rationale was that the risks of some truly bad investments had been transferred from Enron to the Raptors, which were created in conjunction with partnerships run by Andrew S. Fastow, then Enron's chief financial officer. In fact, as the report makes clear, there was no real transfer of risk, and Enron eventually had to shoulder the losses. But there was a large transfer of wealth to the Fastow partnerships, which were guaranteed huge profits while taking no risks. Those transactions helped provide $30 million for Mr. Fastow and millions for other Enron insiders. When it became clear that the Raptor enterprises were failing, Enron desperately restructured them, first at the end of 2000 and again three months later. Those reorganizations, which the committee denounces in the strongest terms, allowed the truth about Enron to stay largely hidden for many months -- a period when top Enron officials sold large quantities of stock. ''The creation, and especially the subsequent restructuring, of the Raptors was perceived by many within Enron as a triumph of accounting ingenuity by a group of innovative accountants,'' the committee report stated. ''We believe that perception was mistaken. Especially after the restructuring, the Raptors were little more than a highly complex accounting construct that was destined to collapse.'' When it did collapse last fall, Enron was forced to take a large loss, which it painted as extraordinary. It was also forced to take a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity -- the amount a company's balance sheet shows the company is worth. As questions about that intensified, Enron's collapse

It is a tale of how accounting rules can be abused and insiders enriched.The report traces the delicate machinery that was used by Enron's accountan=ts. There appears to have been, at least for a time, a tortured interpretat=ion of accounting rules that could be used to justify the hiding of $1 bill=ion in losses.=20But that smokescreen would have been completely unsuccessful had auditors f=rom Arthur Andersen forced the company to disclose what was happening, as t=hey should have done. Those disclosures would have made it clear that there= was no economic rationale for the transactions, and thus no reason to thin=k that Enron had earned nearly as much money as it said it did.=20Over 15 months, from the beginning of the third quarter of 2000 through the= third quarter of 2001, Enron reported pretax profits of $1.5 billion. Had =Enron not used the Raptor artifices, the figure would have been 72 percent =lower: $429 million.=20The accounting rationale was that the risks of some truly bad investments h=ad been transferred from Enron to the Raptors, which were created in conjun=ction with partnerships run by Andrew S. Fastow, then Enron's chief financi=al officer.=20In fact, as the report makes clear, there was no real transfer of risk, and= Enron eventually had to shoulder the losses. But there was a large transfe=r of wealth to the Fastow partnerships, which were guaranteed huge profits =while taking no risks. Those transactions helped provide $30 million for Mr=. Fastow and millions for other Enron insiders.=20When it became clear that the Raptor enterprises were failing, Enron desper=ately restructured them, first at the end of 2000 and again three months la=ter. Those reorganizations, which the committee denounces in the strongest =terms, allowed the truth about Enron to stay largely hidden for many months= -- a period when top Enron officials sold large quantities of stock.=20''The creation, and especially the subsequent restructuring, of the Raptors= was perceived by many within Enron as a triumph of accounting ingenuity by= a group of innovative accountants,'' the committee report stated. ''We bel=ieve that perception was mistaken. Especially after the restructuring, the =Raptors were little more than a highly complex accounting construct that wa=s destined to collapse.''=20When it did collapse last fall, Enron was forced to take a large loss, whic=h it painted as extraordinary.

This email discusses the collapse of Enron and the need for improved financial reporting systems. While it acknowledges the severity of the situation and expresses sympathy for those affected, the overall tone is more focused on systemic issues and the need for improved financial reporting systems rather than on the potential abuse of accounting rules. Therefore, the score is 4, indicating a need for caution rather than outright fraud.

Here's a breakdown of the email:

* **Strengths:**
    * Acknowledges the need for reassessing financial reporting systems and the impact on investors.
    * Highlights the need for transparency and accountability in the financial system.
    * Discusses the broader context of the Enron collapse and the ""new economy"" bubble.
    * Expresses sympathy for those affected by the collapse.

    * Does not provide evidence or examples to support the claims made about the systemic issues.

Therefore, the score is 4.","The email with the score of 10 indicates an abuse of accounting rules. The email discusses how Enron used mark to market accounting practices to hide losses and revenue was realized as profit. This is a clear violation of accounting standards, which require companies to report all their financial information accurately and transparently. By hiding the true financial position of the company, Enron was able to mislead investors and regulators about its financial health.","The bankruptcy of Enron -- at one time the seventh-largest company in the U=.S. -- has underscored the need to reassess not only the adequacy of our fi=nancial reporting systems but also the public watchdog mission of the accou=nting industry, Wall Street security analysts, and corporate boards of dire=ctors. While the full story of what caused Enron to collapse has yet to be =revealed, what is clear is that its accounting statements failed to give in=vestors a complete picture of the firm's operations as well as a fair asses=sment of the risks involved in Enron's business model and financing structu=re.=20Enron is not unique. Incidents of accounting irregularities at large compan=ies such as Sunbeam and Cendant have proliferated. As Joe Berardino, CEO of= Arthur Andersen, said on these pages, ""Our financial reporting model is br=oken. It is out of date and unresponsive to today's new business models, co=mplex financial structures, and associated business risks.""It is important to recognize that losses suffered by Enron's shareholders t=ook place in the context of an enormous bubble in the ""new economy"" part of= the stock market during 1999 and early 2000. Stocks of Internet-related co=mpanies were doubling, then doubling again. Past standards of valuation lik=e ""buy stocks priced at reasonable multiples of earnings"" had given way to =blind faith that any company associated with the Internet was bound to go u=p. Enron was seen as the perfect ""new economy"" stock that could dominate th=e market for energy, communications, and electronic trading and commerce.==20I have sympathy for the Enron workers who came before Congress to tell of h=ow their retirement savings were wiped out as Enron's stock collapsed and h=ow they were constrained from selling.
