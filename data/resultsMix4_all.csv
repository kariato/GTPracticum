**Explanation:**

The email discusses Enron's accounting practices, specifically the use of mark-to-market accounting to hide losses. The email highlights the potential fraud involved in this practice, as it involves evaluating contracts at ""fairvalue"" prices, which can be inflated and unrealized. The email also mentions the potential impact of these practices on Enron's financial position, as they can lead to misleadingly high profits.

Therefore, the email with the subject line ""Bad trading.

Enron's main technique to pump up earnings probably revolvedaround a loose-as-a-goose process for the accounting of energy derivatives.Called mark-to-market, the technique involves evaluating contracts at ""fairvalue"" prices. Since some of these contracts stretched out for 20 years, thefutures market provides no firm prices. And, absent a liquid market withclear prices, ""fair value"" becomes a mug's game in which companies canvastly inflate value. These overstated gains, of course, were also unrealized, noncash gains. InSeptember 2000, Jonathan Weil, a reporter for the Journal, took a look atEnron's second quarter and found that absent noncash earnings, Enron wouldhave had a loss. Mr. Weil later found that for the year as a whole,unrealized trading gains accounted for more than half of the company'soriginally reported pretax profits. Hardly a confidence-builder in thequality of Enron's earnings.When their derivative strategies started to go sour, this theory runs, Enronremoved the contracts from its financial statements and hid them in specialentities created for just that purpose.Bad Assets. Another theory locates Enron's earning problems in their hardassets. Enron had a bunch of huge and underperforming assets, like itsbroadband company, water company and power plants in India and Brazil. Inorder to hustle those assets and associated debts off its financial reports,the company created some limited partnerships to buy these dogs -- eitherwith bank loans or money provided by Enron itself. These partnerships(allegedly) transferred enough control to third parties to get them offEnron's balance sheet. Enron guaranteed these deals with ""make good"" provisions backed by Enronstock -- a promise that Enron would make good any losses in the value of thepartnerships. When the value of the assets tanked, the make-good provisionskicked in, resulting, for example, in the enormous write-down in shareholderequity in November.Depending on which theory one accepts, there are two bottom lines.The first holds that the sagging earnings problem was fatal and that it isentirely possible Enron was in the process of liquidating itself. Jim Chanosof Kynikos Associates hypothesizes that Enron's cost of capital was higherthan its returns on invested capital. A second argues that if Enron'smanagers had been content to accept the fact that in competitive marketstheir ""first mover"" advantage was going to be competed away, and had beenwilling to endure slower earnings growth, it would not be in bankruptcytoday."," Wed, 26 Dec 2001 07:53",154348,0.6877175569534302,,,,,

University of San Diego law professor Frank Partnoy said Enron had used profits from its derivatives trading operation - the full scale of which was little appreciated by investors - to mask losses in its more visible businesses even as some of its employees were fraudulently manipulating those profits.""It will surprise many investors to learn that Enron was, at its core, a derivatives trading firm,"" he said in testimony delivered at a Senate Governmental Affairs Committee hearing. A former Wall Street derivatives trader and white-collar crime specialist, Partnoy has been researching Enron's business practices for a book he is writing about its collapse. Enron officials had no immediate comment on his allegations. ""It made billions trading derivatives, but it lost billions on virtually everything else it did, including projects in fiber-optic bandwidth, retail gas and power, water systems and even technology stocks,"" he said. ""Enron used its expertise in derivatives to hide these losses."" Derivatives are complex financial contracts whose values are linked to underlying variables such as the prices of commodities, stocks or bonds. They are typically used by sophisticated investors to manage risk. Partnoy said Enron's use of derivatives both outside and inside the company could be directly linked to its collapse. On the outside, he said, they were used to create the company's web of off-balance sheet deals with complex financial partnerships known as special-purpose vehicles. After some of those deals went sour, Enron in October took a $1 billion charge against earnings and a $1.2 billion write-down in shareholder equity, triggering its nosedive into bankruptcy. ""Specifically, Enron used derivatives and special purpose vehicles in three ways,"" Partnoy said. ""First, it hid speculator losses it suffered on technology stocks,"" he said. ""Second, it hid huge debts incurred to finance unprofitable new businesses, including retail energy service. Third, it inflated the value of other troubled businesses, including new ventures in fiber-optic bandwidth."" MANIPULATION ALLEGED But Enron's derivatives problems ran far deeper than the outside special purpose vehicles, Partnoy said, adding he had also gathered information indicating widespread manipulation of the company's derivatives trading revenues. ""In a nutshell, it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit and loss entries for the derivatives Enron traded,"" he said. ""Simply put, Enron's reported earnings from derivatives seem to be more imagined than real."""," Thu, 24 Jan 2002 14:28",323049,0.7263162136077881,,,,,

The company is restating earnings through the first half of this year, mainly to reflect a $1.2-billion (U.S.) drop in shareholder equity after the company terminated complex share transactions with certain limited partnerships. The dealings had enabled Enron to grow dramatically without having to show a huge whack of debt on its balance sheet, which would have affected its ability to raise capital and hampered its rapid transformation from regional gas pipeline utility to global energy-trading powerhouse. Such transactions are common and practical. But Enron's were unusually complicated, and the company was roundly assailed for keeping the details to itself. Disclosure has never been this company's middle name. The former CEO once used a seven-letter expletive to describe an analyst who had the temerity to ask for a balance sheet during an earnings conference call. But the real stunner was that, unknown to the investing public but with the board's apparent approval, two partnerships had been set up, to considerable personal profit, by Enron's own chief financial officer, Andrew Faston. He walked the plank on Oct. 24, and the company has been scrambling ever since. Opaque accounting doesn't necessarily mean there is any skullduggery afoot. The finances of some companies are devilishly complicated, simply because of the nature of their businesses. And that goes for Enron and its massive energy-trading and hedging operations."," Fri, 9 Nov 2001 05:11",260213,0.8203611373901367,,,,,

This email exhibits some questionable accounting practices, but not necessarily outright fraud. The email highlights the use of mark-to-market accounting and the potential misinterpretation of the company's financial position. While the email claims that the accounting practices are ""legal and totally appropriate,"" this statement is subjective and does not constitute professional accounting advice. The email also mentions the company's third-quarter loss and the subsequent reduction of shareholder equity, which raises concerns about the accuracy and transparency of the company's financial reporting. However, the email does not provide sufficient evidence to support these concerns, and therefore it is difficult to determine whether the accounting practices employed in this case constitute abuse of the accounting rules.

Overall, the email score is 6 out of 10, primarily due to the potential misinterpretation of the company's financial position and the lack of evidence to support the concerns raised in the email.","The email with the score of 10 indicates an abuse of accounting rules as it suggests that Enron was hiding losses by placing them in a separate entity called Raptors and then marking to market those assets.

This email exhibits some questionable accounting practices and attempts to downplay the severity of the situation. While the author acknowledges the potential for fraud and the need for transparency, the overall tone is defensive and attempts to justify Enron's actions.

**Key points:**

* **Misleading statement:** ""Traditional accounting would have required the company to mark down its current earnings to cover the declining value of these assets."" This statement is inaccurate. While traditional accounting may require marking down assets when their value declines, Enron chose to use outside partnerships to buy the assets at list price, effectively hiding the losses.
* **Downplaying the severity:** The author claims that ""Enron's problem was bad assets of a conventional variety"" and dismisses the issue of misleading accounting practices. This is an oversimplification. Enron's problems were primarily due to its aggressive accounting practices and its reliance on leverage.
* **Lack of transparency:** The author acknowledges the need for transparency but does not provide any evidence to support their claims. They also fail to mention the potential consequences of their actions, such as the potential impact on shareholders and the market.

""You constantly see a regular group of people selling as they monetize their compensation"" at Enron, he says. ""However, the larger sales from senior executives are different. Sales have been weighted much more heavily to Lay and Skilling than they have been in the past."" Dietert's 12-month price for Enron is $58, and his firm has not provided banking services to Enron. Simmons does not rate companies. Another analyst who asked not to be named was more critical. ""The [insider sales] are disconcerting to say the least. In a market like this where the slightest indication of lack of confidence sends a stock down precipitously, their actions are speaking louder than their words."" Dream vs. RealityOne reason for the mixed messages may have been the company's belief in broadband. At the time Skilling made his now famous $126 tout, he indicated that nearly $40 of value would come from Enron's now flailing broadband business. As my colleagues Adam Lashinsky </comment/siliconstreet/1489696.html> and Peter Eavis </comment/detox/1489630.html> have aptly chronicled, Enron's great dream for broadband turned into a nightmare. ""The world certainly looks a lot different today than it did in January, especially to Enron,"" says Tom McIntyre, president of Dessauer & McIntyre Asset Management, a Massachusetts-based investment adviser. ""You sure don't see projections from anyone assigning value to broadband now."" In fact, on Enron's second-quarter earnings call, Skilling lamented the fact that investors seem to be assigning negative value to the company's telecom operations. McIntyre holds a long position in Enron. Still, investors might have expected Skilling's words to be backed by his actions. When he made the bullish comments in January, Skilling was selling stock even though the shares were trading near $80 a share, a 57% discount to his target price. That led the analyst to quip, ""If it's not an expensive stock, why are they out there selling it?"" To others, however, the sales are just noise that distracts from a solid growth story. ""You would prefer it if they would never sell,"" says McIntyre. ""I'd rather watch them hold the shares like I do. However, [Skilling] still owns well over a million shares, and the consistent sales suggest they have a program to sell whether the stock is near its high or at its lows."" (Records show that Skilling has been selling 10,000 shares each week since mid-November.) The two executives ""have a long record of creating and sustaining value for shareholders. I have a high level of confidence that Skilling can continue that record,"" McIntyre said. But appearances count. ""It's a question of perceptions,"" says McIntyre.

At least 10 law firms are seeking class action status on behalf of plaintiffs they said were deceived by false and misleading statements or because adverse information was concealed, causing Enron's shares to be artificially inflated.""Enron restating its earnings is certainly going to help our case. It demonstrates that in their opinion their earnings were false when initially published,"" said lawyer Arthur Stock of Berger & Montague PC in Philadelphia, one of the law firms seeking class-action status. Enron declined to comment. The lawsuits name the company, Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay, former CEO Jeffrey Skilling and Andrew Fastow, a former chief financial officer, as defendants. In another blow to its damaged reputation among investors, the Houston-based company last week admitted it erred in reporting past results. It reduced its earnings from 1997 to 2000 by $591 million, or 22 percent of the amount that had previously been released on its financial statements. Earnings for the first two quarters of 2001 also were restated. Enron has garnered investor ire since it unexpectedly reduced shareholder equity by $1.2 billion in mid-October, saying off-balance sheet transactions had contributed to that and to $1 billion in charges. The company's stock plunged as almost daily developments sullied investors. It lost almost 80 percent of value from the day the company reported its first quarterly loss in more than four years on Oct. 16, to the announcement last week that rival Dynegy Inc. would buy Enron for about $9 billion in stock and the assumption of about $13 billion in debt.

He notes that Enron management lacked an 'honor among thieves,' but predicts that Enron alumni will flourish. I suspect he is working on the Enron book right now.---schIs Enron the New Drexel? By Michael Lewis, the author of ``Liar's Poker'' and ``The New New Thing.''Berkeley, California, Dec. 20 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. is rapidly expanding the American business journalists' notion of what is possible: No story can ever again be said to be too outrageous to be true. The boss, Kenneth Lay, was a friend of the current president of these United States, an adviser to his administration and one of his biggest financial backers. The company itself was rated ``strong buy'' by analysts at almost every Wall Street firm, considered a shining example of modern accounting by reputable accounting firms, and plugged endlessly by the business press. Six years running as Fortune's most innovative company! And all the while this same operation was, at the very top, a lie. Understandably, people long for some analogy to help them grasp this situation, but really there isn't a good one. Other than failed hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management, Michael Milken's junk bond department at Drexel Burnham Lambert offers the closest parallels on Wall Street, and several people have written to me over the past week to suggest it. But it really is unfair to Milken to compare him to Lay. Alumni Will Flourish True, in both cases profitable trading businesses collapsed because their creditors came to distrust the people who ran them. And in both cases the core business -- Drexel's junk bonds and Enron's energy trading -- remain viable in the hands of other companies that banks trust. Just as the Drexel junk bond traders who didn't go to jail went to other Wall Street firms and created replicas of their former business, former Enron traders will soon be making lots of money for one-time rivals such as Dynegy Inc. and Duke Energy Corp. Well before Kenneth Lay emerges from his legal hell, the energy trading business will return to normal. But the morality of the cases are entirely different. Whatever you think of Milken's junk bond department -- and I think its sins were minor beside its achievements -- you must admit the people in it exhibited a certain honor among thieves. There was never a moment when Milken betrayed the broad interests of his traders for his own narrow ones. He paid himself huge sums of money, but he also made huge sums for his firm. He was careful to watch out for the little people who worked for him, and they loved him for it. The Enron bosses, by contrast, pillaged their firm and left the little people who worked for them holding the bag. Different Motivations"," Mon, 24 Dec 2001 15:41",512111,0.8742069005966187,,,,,

However, the email about Lay attending a Bush administration economic forum and Vice President Cheney seeking his advice on energy policy is not an indication of fraud or abuse, as it simply shows that Enron was involved in political activities. The final email about Enron's expansion into new markets and its increased revenue from sales to affiliates is also not an indication of fraud or abuse, as it simply shows the company's growth and success in these areas. Overall, the emails indicate that there was a high level of awareness within Enron about the potential abuse of mark-to-market accounting practices, but no clear evidence of outright fraud or abuse.","Lay attended a Bush administration economic forum in January,and Vice President Richard Cheney sought his advice on energypolicy. Enron, its political action committee and employees gavealmost $2.5 million to federal candidates and political partieslast year, with about 75 percent of the money going toRepublicans, according to campaign finance records. ``Enron is aligned with all the Texas energy exploration andproduction money,'' said Glenn Reynolds, an analyst atCreditSights Inc. ``They know how to do business.'' Risky Strategy In 1990, Lay hired Skilling, who became a force behind thecompany's growth. He ripped away walls in Enron's headquarters,built trading desks and transformed the company's regulatedpipeline and utility units into a business that some analysts sayresembles a hedge fund. Enron reported 1999 profit of $893 million and $40.1 billionin revenue. That same year, Enron expanded into water utilities,sewage treatment and trading space on fiber-optictelecommunication networks. Shareholder lawsuits filed in the pastmonth say those business were money losers from the start and thatexecutives mislead investors about them. A junior executive in Europe dreamed up an idea in 1999 foran Internet trading site dealing paper, plastics and othercommodities, in addition to the usual natural gas and electricityofferings. The site handled $50 billion in transactions in itsfirst six months and more than $880 billion in trades in twoyears, 60 percent of the company's total. ``Enron had a tremendous appetite for risk,'' said PeterFusaro, president of Global Change Associates, which didconsulting for Enron. ``They were the first in many markets, wouldtake long-term contracts, they were just super-aggressive. Theyhired Type-A MBA's from the best schools who learned the energybusiness from scratch.'' Investors in Dark Unknown by most investors, some of Enron's increased revenuewas coming from sales of power plants to Enron-affiliatedpartnerships. Those partnerships paid for the purchases by sellingbonds that were guaranteed by Enron. As a result, Enron's books showed an increase in cash fromthe sales, and a decrease in debt associated with the plants. AnEnron restatement of finances earlier this month showed that asmuch as $3.9 billion, or about a quarter of Enron's total longterm debt, had been shifted from Enron's books to affiliates. Skilling quit the company in August. Former Enron ChiefFinancial Officer Andrew Fastow was fired last month, after thecompany revealed that Fastow had personally profited fromtransactions he conducted with Enron partnerships. Enron has saidit's cooperating with an SEC probe."," Thu, 29 Nov 2001 06:32",260260,0.8797465562820435,,,,,

    * The equity derivative transactions with the related party appear to be at armslength, raising questions about their legitimacy.
    * The veil of secrecy surrounding LJM and Raptor is concerning, as employees question the accounting propriety consistently.
    * The comments of employees expressing dissatisfaction with the company's practices and the potential for being caught highlight the seriousness of the situation.
* **Potential for abuse:**
    * The email mentions a ""handshake deal"" between the C.F.O. and Skilling, which could be seen as an attempt to bypass proper accounting procedures.
    * The potential for misleading accounting practices and the potential for write-downs due to the company's commitments to LJM raise concerns about the overall financial health of Enron.

**However, the email also includes some mitigating factors:**

* The email mentions the potential for a cleanup plan, which could help to rectify the situation.
* The email does not explicitly state any intention to deceive or mislead investors, although it does acknowledge the potential for negative consequences.

LJM along with LJM2 and Chewco have become the most notorious of the shady accounting partnerships set up by Enron.

On Nov. 8, 2001, the same day the company announced that its financial statements from 1997 through the first half of 2001 ""should not be relied upon,"" Enron filed an ""8-K"" form -- an interim document required for certain types of financial events -- with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In that form, <http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/> Enron disclosed that some of the ""limited partners"" in the partnerships ""were, at the time of the investment, non-executive officers or employees of Enron."" Enron also announced that it was ""terminating the employment"" of Glisan and Mordaunt for participating in the LJM partnerships. ""At the time these individuals invested in the limited partnership, LJM1 had ceased entering into new transactions with Enron,"" Enron's 8-K stated. ""However, some pre-existing investments involving LJM1 and Enron were still in effect, and Enron believes that these investments resulted in distributions or payments to LJM1 and to the limited partnership in which these individuals invested."" According to the congressional investigator, Mordaunt reaped her LJM windfall after she was approached by an Enron executive, who asked her if she wanted to make some money. Yes, she said. ""Give me a check for $6,000,"" he told her, according to the congressional investigator. Later, the executive asked Mordaunt for her bank account number so he could deposit the proceeds from her investment. ""How much is it?"" she asked. He told her to check her bank account the next day. When she did, she discovered over $1 million had been deposited into her account. The congressional committee is currently investigating the matter. The Nov. 8 SEC filing also clarified Fastow's role in the company. He was no longer officially on a leave of absence. He ""is no longer working for Enron,"" the filing stated. At a November news conference, then-CEO Kenneth Lay reported that he knew about the partnerships but not about Mordaunt's and Glisan's role in them.

However, the email about Kenneth Lay's statement on Enron becoming overleveraged is not an indication of fraud because he was simply stating that things went wrong in ways that ""I could not have ever contemplated."" The email about Dynegy buying Enron is also not an indication of abuse of accounting rules because it does not mention any specific accounting practices.","WHAT a tangled web was weaved by Enron. Both investors and managers seem to have been misled. ''Enron became overleveraged,'' Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive, said this week, adding that things went wrong in ways that ''I could not have ever contemplated.'' He pointed to investments that ''performed far worse than we ever could have imagined.''That was the first time that Enron had admitted it had a leverage problem, and it came only after the brutal reality had become apparent to many others. Mr. Lay says he understood what was going on, but I suspect he had left crucial details to others who have since departed and did not fully grasp the reality that was obscured by Enron's soothing financial statements. When Enron was riding high, it could easily have sold stock to raise capital that it now desperately wants. Mr. Lay and other executives sold stock, but the company did not. Just a month ago, Mr. Lay spoke enthusiastically of how great the company's continuing earnings were. The leverage was not easy to find. A lot of it was carried off Enron's balance sheet. Partnerships and special-purpose entities that Enron set up borrowed money and funneled the cash to Enron. Enron guaranteed the debt but did not have to show it on its own balance sheet because it could meet its obligations by issuing stock. As undisclosed losses built up in those entities, it became more likely they could not pay their bills, leaving Enron to do so. It is also clear that the bond rating agencies did not understand Enron's plight until the last couple of weeks. When they figured it out, it took a $1.5 billion equity infusion that is part of the Dynegy takeover to keep Enron's rating above junk level. Now Enron has a board committee investigating various transactions, and promises to release details as they are uncovered. Officials speak as if they are learning what happened for the first time, and perhaps they are. Jeffrey Skilling, Mr. Lay's protege, was Enron's chief financial engineer until he quit this summer. And Enron's chief financial officer and treasurer were ousted as Enron unraveled. Some investors would say none of that matters now, that the only important fact is that Dynegy is buying Enron anyway. Chuck Watson, Dynegy's chief executive, is convinced that Enron's energy trading business is a gem that more than justifies the price Dynegy is paying. He figures the losses from the bad investments can be contained. The big question now may be whether Mr. Watson will retain his enthusiasm after his people study Enron's trading positions. Enron has always said it hedged its big derivative positions -- positions that can contain huge leverage that does not show up on the balance sheet -- but some of that hedging was with affiliated companies. If big surprises are found, Dynegy could back out of the deal."," Fri, 16 Nov 2001 06:02",260201,0.8817439675331116,,,,,

This email exhibits several red flags that indicate potential accounting malpractice and fraud. While the email does not explicitly state the intention to hide losses, the language and context suggest that this is the case.

**Red flags:**

* **Misleading statements:** The email claims that the accounting practices are ""100% legal and trasparent,"" which is demonstrably false.
* **Lack of transparency:** The email avoids discussing the specifics of the transactions with LJM and Raptor, creating a veil of secrecy.
* **Conflicting interests:** The email mentions potential conflicts of interest with the firm's auditors, Arthur Andersen and PricewaterhouseCoopers, raising concerns about their ability to provide unbiased advice.
* **Employee concerns:** The email acknowledges employee concerns about the inappropriateness of the transactions and the potential consequences, including potential write-downs and legal action.

**However, the email does not provide enough evidence to definitively determine whether it constitutes outright fraud:**

* The email does not explicitly state the intent to deceive or mislead investors.
* The email does not provide any documentation or evidence to support the claims made about the transactions.

Enron yesterday marked four years of earnings down sharply after taking account of off-balance-sheet dealings.The company admitted that several of its off-balance-sheet, special-purpose entities should have been consolidated on its balance sheet. The effect of the change was to reduce earnings substantially in each year from 1997 to 2000; from $105m to $9m in 1997, from $703m to $590m in 1998, from $893m to $643m in 1999 and from $979m to $847m in 2000. This year's earnings were marginally increased but the company's third-quarter loss widened marginally from $618m to $635m. In the Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Enron also announced the dismissal of two more officials: Ben Glisan, the company's treasurer, and Kristina Mordaunt, general counsel for one division. Enron ran into trouble on October 16, when it announced a $1.2bn reduction of shareholders' equity and a $1.01bn charge. Yesterday's filing goes some way to explaining how the charge came about. Enron attributed the charge to dealings with LJM, a private equity fund run by Andrew Fastow, formerly Enron chief financial officer. Private equity investments have injected enormous volatility into the earnings of companies, such as JP Morgan Chase. Keeping LJM off the balance sheet allowed Enron to avoid major swings. But to prevent LJM being consolidated, Enron had to own less than half of the special-purpose vehicle, and for outside investors to participate they had to be compensated. What that meant was that when the value of Enron's private equity investments fell below a certain level, people familiar with Enron's balance sheet said, co-investors would receive Enron stock. The Enron filing reveals that the LJM losses arose from another group of special-purpose entities, known as the Raptor vehicles, which were designed in part to hedge an Enron investment in a bankrupt broadband company, Rhythm NetConnections. The $1.2bn reduction in shareholders' equity arose from the termination of the Raptor hedging arrangements, which if they had continued would have resulted in Enron issuing 58m shares to offset the company's private equity losses. Enron also revealed that Mr Fastow was paid in excess of $30m as a result of his role in running LJM. At issue is whether Mr Fastow was acting in the best interests of other Enron shareholders. The filing also raises questions about Enron's cash flow, which will be studied carefully by the rating agencies and creditors. A group of banks, including Barclays Bank, Credit Suisse First Boston, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup, have lent more than $4bn to Enron over the last weeks, much of it not collateralised."," Fri, 9 Nov 2001 05:11",260213,0.883965015411377,,,,,

While the email acknowledges the company's collapse and the significant losses incurred by investors, it emphasizes the legality of the practices employed by Enron and its auditor, Arthur Andersen.

**Key points:**

* **Lack of evidence:** The email claims that there is no evidence to suggest that the accounting practices were illegal. However, this statement is not entirely accurate. While there has not been any evidence of outright fraud, the practices employed by Enron were certainly misleading and manipulative.
* **Misleading statements:** The email states that the collapse of Enron was due to a bad business plan, implying that the accounting practices were not a major factor. This is inaccurate. Enron's collapse was primarily caused by its reliance on accounting loopholes and its inability to manage its debt.
* **Lack of transparency:** The email highlights the lack of transparency surrounding Enron's accounting practices. However, this does not excuse the company's actions. Investors had the right to know the true financial position of Enron, regardless of the lack of transparency.

More than 20 class-action lawsuits have been filed in recent weeks, and new ones are popping up every day. A formal process has been started to consolidate litigation in Houston, where the troubled energy company is based, with all lawyers interested in the case required to stake their claims by December 21st.The broadest accusations will be of fraud and material misstatement, legal ways of saying that the company's financial statements were garbage. This week, Enron's founder and chairman, Kenneth Lay, decided to forgo a severance package worth over $60m while admitting that the company's problems ""had been exacerbated by the extensive use of debt capital, both on and off the balance sheet"". America's Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) is looking again at off-balance-sheet financing, having fretted about it on and off for a decade. There will also be charges of insider trading, because even as Enron was issuing securities amid glowing profits reports, top executives were dumping over $1 billion of Enron shares to ""unsuspecting investors"", a group that includes anybody who, however briefly, has held one of the company's 750m shares in the past two years. ""The number of class members will be huge,"" says Maurice Pesso, a lawyer at a New York firm that has filed a claim. There are, however, limits to the company's liability. It has already restated its results going back five years, but federal law restricts litigation to the past three. Moreover, Enron will not take the rap alone. Its auditor, Arthur Andersen (now plain Andersen), is also named as a defendant in at least one of the complaints already filed. The litigation comes after a rough decade for Andersen. It has had to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in settlements after sloppy audits on such companies as Waste Management, Sunbeam and Discovery Zone. Because Enron evolved from an energy company into a financial firm, it became much like an unregulated bank. The lack of supervision meant that the role of the company's auditor was crucial. Andersen was certainly paid as if it was. In 2000, it collected $25m for auditing Enron's books and another $27m for consulting services.

Congressional investigators reportedly have an October 3, 2000 videotape in which former CEO Jeffrey Skilling vigorously defends Enron's accounting methods and touts the partnership deals now linked to its collapse. The tape raises questions about Skilling's recent testimony to lawmakers in which he said he knew of nothing wrong with Enron's finances when he resigned last August, citing personal reasons. In a transcript of the tape, Skilling responds to an Enron employee's concern about a Wall Street Journal article. The September 20, 2000 story discussed Enron's use of an accounting method that books long-term contracts as current income. The article also said Enron would have had a 2nd quarter loss if not for $747 million in unrealized gains from risk management activities. However, Skilling says the story is just totally without merit, adding that Enron's accounting is conservative and the company provides more data in its annual report than anyone in a transaction-based industry. He then concludes that the company is in a strong position from an accounting basis. During the same meeting, Skilling tells employees the company will be bringing in partners to help Enron leverage its capital in its new Enron Net Works division. Earlier this month in testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Skilling said he was not aware of any inappropriate financing arrangements designed to conceal liabilities, or overstate earnings.

The opinions expressed are his own.)   Las Vegas, Nov. 13 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. shareholders never blinked as Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay piled up pay -- salary, bonuses, stock grants and options -- that would meet almost any definition of excessive.  From 1993 to the end of 2000, Lay's potential compensation came to $614 million if you add unexercised option profits to the millions he actually pocketed.  Sad to say, Lay's paper profit of $362 million at the end of 2000 has evaporated as Enron's stock lost about 90 percent of its value. The Houston, Texas, energy company, beset by accounting problems, is now being bought by a smaller competitor, Dynegy Inc.  Still, the 59-year-old Lay hauled away $31.5 million a year in real dollars over the last eight years, a generous amount given Enron's recent admission -- after the Securities and Exchange Commission opened an investigation -- that it overstated earnings by $586 million in five of those years.  Lay was Enron's CEO from the time it was formed 15 years ago in a merger of natural-gas pipeline operators until he stepped down in February for prot?g? Jeffrey Skilling. Skilling left unexpectedly in August for ``personal'' reasons.   CEO'S Return   In six months under Skilling, Enron's total return to shareholders was a negative 46 percent, four times worse than the performance of the Standard & Poor's 500 Index. It was also a sharp contrast to the 30 percent a year Enron returned to shareholders over the previous eight years under Lay, when the company's performance was almost double that of the S&P 500.  So Lay became CEO again after Skilling's mid-August departure -- and Enron's performance has now been even worse: minus 78 percent versus the 5.8 percent negative return of for the S&P 500.  While Lay has an employment agreement extending all the way to 2005, the company's pending acquisition by Dynegy leaves his future in doubt. For Enron's battered shareholders, whose stock once was among the S&P 500's top performers, that may not be such bad news.  Enron shareholders endured a roller-coaster ride during Lay's long tenure, their stock 2.2 times as volatile as that of the S&P 500 Index."," Tue, 13 Nov 2001 06:20",260206,0.8871437311172485,,,,,

Details of those charges were not disclosed, and Enron said it might further alter its reporting as a special board committee continues its investigation of the partnership transactions. ''This is an unfortunate situation,'' said David Tabolt, a spokesman for Arthur Andersen, which audited Enron's books in all the years in question. ''Issues have surfaced that have caused the company to restate its financial statements and advise investors that they should not rely on Enron's financial statements or our audit reports. We are cooperating with the company and its special committee to bring resolution to these matters.'' While the restated financial statements consolidated the results of two partnerships and the LJM1 subsidiary, they did not fold the entire LJM1 partnership or the LJM2 partnership into Enron's financials. It is not clear how those partnerships performed. Nor did they include some other related entities whose Enron-guaranteed debts have aroused concern among investors. Mr. Fastow, Enron's former chief financial officer, could not be reached for comment, his lawyer said. Enron's downward cascade began after it reported third-quarter earnings on Oct. 16. Its share price rose 67 cents, to $33.84, that day, as the company said its ''recurring net income'' had met analyst expectations, even though write-offs led to a net loss. In a conference call that day, Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman, mentioned that the company had written down shareholder equity by $1.2 billion as it closed out its relationships with the LJM partnerships. In the following days, that figure became widely discussed as some investors concluded that the company had suffered a large loss that it was able to avoid reporting on the earnings statement. But Enron said yesterday that reduction should have been only $200 million, with the remaining $1 billion reduction simply reversing prior errors made in 2000 and early this year. Enron said it had set up procedures to monitor transactions with the LJM partnerships and assure they were proper. ''Whether these controls were properly implemented'' is being investigated by the special board committee, the company said. That committee has retained William McLucas, a former director of enforcement for the S.E.C., as well as accountants from Deloitte & Touche."," Fri, 9 Nov 2001 05:11",260213,0.8876338601112366,,,,,

**Explanation:**

This email discusses the Enron scandal and its implications for the U.S. accounting system. While it does not explicitly mention accounting practices or their potential abuse, it does raise concerns about the lack of transparency and accountability within the industry. The email highlights the fact that two of the Big Five accounting firms had intimate knowledge of Enron's activities, and the potential consequences of these practices for the accounting system.

However, the email does not provide enough evidence or context to support its claims. It does not provide any specific examples of the alleged accounting abuses or provide any evidence to support the claims about the lack of transparency and accountability. Therefore, it is difficult to assess the severity of the potential abuse of accounting rules in this email.

Overall, the email score of 8 reflects the potential for abuse of accounting rules, but it does not necessarily indicate that the practices described are actually fraudulent. More information and context would be needed to provide a more accurate assessment.","The email with the score of 10 indicates an abuse of accounting rules as it suggests that Enron was hiding losses by placing them in a separate entity called Raptors and then marking to market those assets.

To many of their former colleagues, Mordaunt's and Glisan's closeness to Fastow's suspicious transactions makes things look even worse. ""To many of us, this looks and smells like a bribe,"" said one Enron former employee. ""'I' -- Fastow -- 'will give you money, you shut up.' Or put another way, 'Here is the payoff for helping me set up the structures that helped me rake in more than $30 million.'"" The two weren't merely ""Enron executives,"" the former employee says, ""they were the treasurer and one of the top lawyers in the company. And both of them worked on LJM-related deals. That is what makes it sickening."" The accusations highlight the personal betrayal many Enron executives feel. After Mordaunt and Glisan were fired last November, their former colleagues spent much time trying to figure out how it all could have happened. Mordaunt, according to a current Enron executive, ""was very tight with Andy [Fastow]. Andy was responsible for making her managing director, and she would have done anything for him."" Nonetheless, as a lawyer, Mordaunt should have known better, the executive said. ""Given his connection with LJM, which was dicey at best and at worst probably illegal, I personally would have stayed far away from it. But you never know how Andy spun it to her."" After working as Fastow's top lawyer, Mordaunt later served as chief counsel for EBS, an Enron subsidiary set up specifically to handle another complex partnership, code-named Braveheart. In Braveheart, Enron sold 10 years' worth of future revenue from a broadband interactive television deal it was setting up with Blockbuster. Although the deal itself never went past the testing stage, Enron booked $110 million worth of revenue for selling off those future, never-to-be-realized earnings. Glisan also played a key role in Fastow's division, a former Enron executive noted: ""All the deals we did had to go through Glisan and get his approval because of the impact on funds flow."" The former executive, like others affiliated with the firm, said that he once had a positive impression of Glisan and was surprised to learn that he had been an LJM investor. To some current and former Enron executives, the transformation of respected managers like Mordaunt and Glisan represented a major shift in the company ethos. ""In my opinion this all goes back to when Jeff Skilling took over and Enron ceased being an energy company and we became an earnings company,"" said one former executive, referring to Enron's metamorphosis into a company that focused more on highly complex financial-derivatives trading than on actual commodities."," Thu, 31 Jan 2002 08:54",323575,0.8903638124465942,,,,,

Worse, disclosed only in passing by Mr Lay in a conference call with analysts, the firm suffered a $1.2 billion reduction in capital, stemming from a hedging deal with a related private-equity fund called LJM. The charge was due to Enron's forced sale of 55m of its own shares when the partnership was unwound this summer.

* **Misleading statements:** The email claims that Enron's accounting practices were ""transparent"" and ""100% legal,"" which is inaccurate. The mark-to-market accounting practices used to hide losses were widely criticized for being misleading and manipulative.
* **Lack of accountability:** The email does not address the lack of accountability exhibited by Enron management. The company's collapse was due to a combination of factors, including its accounting practices and its lack of transparency.
* **Comparison to Milken:** While the email draws parallels between Enron and Milken's junk bond department, these comparisons are not entirely fair. Milken's firm was not engaged in the same type of accounting practices as Enron, and he was not accused of any wrongdoing.

I suspect he is working on the Enron book right now.---schIs Enron the New Drexel? By Michael Lewis, the author of ``Liar's Poker'' and ``The New New Thing.''Berkeley, California, Dec. 20 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. is rapidly expanding the American business journalists' notion of what is possible: No story can ever again be said to be too outrageous to be true. The boss, Kenneth Lay, was a friend of the current president of these United States, an adviser to his administration and one of his biggest financial backers. The company itself was rated ``strong buy'' by analysts at almost every Wall Street firm, considered a shining example of modern accounting by reputable accounting firms, and plugged endlessly by the business press. Six years running as Fortune's most innovative company! And all the while this same operation was, at the very top, a lie. Understandably, people long for some analogy to help them grasp this situation, but really there isn't a good one. Other than failed hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management, Michael Milken's junk bond department at Drexel Burnham Lambert offers the closest parallels on Wall Street, and several people have written to me over the past week to suggest it. But it really is unfair to Milken to compare him to Lay. Alumni Will Flourish True, in both cases profitable trading businesses collapsed because their creditors came to distrust the people who ran them. And in both cases the core business -- Drexel's junk bonds and Enron's energy trading -- remain viable in the hands of other companies that banks trust. Just as the Drexel junk bond traders who didn't go to jail went to other Wall Street firms and created replicas of their former business, former Enron traders will soon be making lots of money for one-time rivals such as Dynegy Inc. and Duke Energy Corp. Well before Kenneth Lay emerges from his legal hell, the energy trading business will return to normal. But the morality of the cases are entirely different. Whatever you think of Milken's junk bond department -- and I think its sins were minor beside its achievements -- you must admit the people in it exhibited a certain honor among thieves. There was never a moment when Milken betrayed the broad interests of his traders for his own narrow ones. He paid himself huge sums of money, but he also made huge sums for his firm. He was careful to watch out for the little people who worked for him, and they loved him for it. The Enron bosses, by contrast, pillaged their firm and left the little people who worked for them holding the bag.

This email falls into the category of ""potentially misleading"" rather than outright fraud. While it does not explicitly attempt to hide losses, it does use misleading language and fails to disclose important information. 

**Here's a breakdown of the email:**

* **Misleading language:** The email uses phrases like ""share settled costless collar arrangements"" and ""derivative instruments which eliminated the contingent natu=re of existing restricted forward contracts"" which are difficult for the average investor to understand. This makes it difficult for investors to understand the true nature of the transactions and their potential impact on the company's financial standing.
* **Lack of disclosure:** The email does not mention the $1.2 billion reduction in shareholders' equity, which is a material fact that should have been disclosed. This omission is misleading and potentially harmful to investors.
* **Lack of transparency:** The email does not provide enough information about the partnerships or the specific nature of the transactions. This lack of transparency further raises concerns about the potential misleading nature of the email.

It's an excerpt from an analyst's noteout this AM.A Perspective: R.I.P. Enron:It took sixteen years to build Enron into a $63 billion asset powerhouse,but only 24 days for it to disintegrate.The fatal flaw was the aggressive accounting and leveraging done in variousoff balance sheet partnerships (Special Purpose Entities), which apparentlybecame too aggressive to fully disclose. Wall Street had no idea of their holdings,their leverage or their derivative exposures. The SPEs mutated intosomething beyond the pale, becoming a company within a company. This evidently began30 months ago when the new management regime (Skilling, Fastow, et al)sanctioned their evolution. Make no mistake: they were cleverly contrived. Theyinvolved conventional asset & debt transfers off the books, coupled with fair value(asset mark-to-market) accounting and synthetic equity financing. Thisallowed for considerable earnings management and the appearance of cost-free equity.If nothing else, they now appear in hindsight to have been vanity deals: veryNew Economy, very Virtual and very aggressive. But no clients ever complained,to our knowledge. Yet ENE clearly crossed the GAAP reporting lines, as thelatest 8-K attests, and the dual role of the CFO (sitting on both sides of thetable in the LJM transactions), profiting highly in the process, created in the LJMpartnership natural conflicts of interest now being investigated by the SEC.Because of this elementary mistake in any seasoned judgment, which passedmuster at every level, the most successful energy company of the 90s was vaporizedin the marketplace. The main thing that brought ENE down was hubris. It hadused up all of its credibility when the partnerships were brought to light. If thesewere fully revealed two years ago, a collapse would have been very unlikely.Rob LloydAIM Management"," Tue, 13 Nov 2001 08:48",37413,0.8931098580360413, FW>>  FW>>  FW>> ,>> >> >> ,">> >> >>  Lloyd, Robert J [mailto"," Tuesday, November 13, 2001 10>>  Tuesday, November 13, 2001 10>>  Tuesday, November 13, 2001 9",

If one of the nation's three credit-rating agencies -- Moody's, Standard & Poor's or Fitch IBCA -- give a company an investment grade rating, it can essentially act like J.P. Morgan Chase or Citigroup, two of the world's biggest banks. But Enron was able to offer credit without being required to keep a set amount of capital in place, as banks are. And whereas traders dealing with securities or futures contracts must pass difficult licensing exams, companies that trade only in derivatives often can do as they please. Enron managed to become a major player in the derivatives market not just by taking advantage of these loopholes. The company also built up its reputation through a mix of deceit, hobnobbing and bravado. Its high credit rating was maintained by hiding billions of dollars of debt in off-balance sheet partnerships. Its gravy train included prominent economists, politicians and journalists. By dint of ceaseless self-promotion, executives like Ken Lay and Jeffrey Skilling made Enron's name synonymous with successful financial innovation. Investment bankers now speak with derision of Enron's arrogant attempt to invade the turf of the big boys. And many in the investment community are quick to separate themselves from Enron's taint. The fault for Enron's collapse lies with Enron, they argue -- not the lack of regulation. The company gamed the system and paid the price. New rules, they stress, would only punish the innocent companies with higher costs and more red tape. The lesson of Enron's collapse is not that government needs to save the markets from themselves, but rather that bad companies fail, says Nik Khakee, director of Standard & Poor's structured finance derivatives group. ""Some people would argue that it's good for there to be more players in the derivatives market, but you need to make sure that they're all operating under an accepted set of rules,"" he says. Enron, he implied, made up its own rules. Proponents of credit derivatives, in particular, dismiss the idea that Enron's fall has any larger systemic importance. Enron's derivatives will simply be redistributed, they argue. In fact, Enron's involvement with credit derivatives should be seen as ""a bright spot,"" according to William Harrison, CEO of J.P. Morgan Chase, who defended them on Jan. 16, according to a Financial Times report. Without credit derivatives, Harrison and others have argued, Enron's $33 billion debt default would have been more highly concentrated, forcing banks that had a direct relationship with Enron to lose massive amounts of money, or close."," Tue, 5 Feb 2002 14:28",323294,0.8950834274291992,,,,,

This email attempts to downplay the severity of Enron's accounting practices and the resulting losses. While the email acknowledges the charge of $1.2 billion and the subsequent impact on the company's credit rating, it focuses primarily on the negative consequences for other US corporations and the potential impact on the balance between trading and producing. The email also highlights the lack of transparency and the potential lack of professionalism among equity analysts.

However, the email does not provide sufficient evidence to support its claims. For example, the email does not provide any evidence to support the statement that the charge of $1.2 billion was the result of financial transactions or the SEC investigation. Additionally, the email does not provide any evidence to support the statement that the company's accounts lacked transparency.

Overall, the email attempts to downplay the severity of Enron's accounting practices and the resulting losses.

After announcing on October 16, with=out much explanation or transparency, that it has taken a charge of $ 1.2 b=illion against equity, Enron's share price started tumbling. Apparently, th=e charge was the result of some financial transactions, and the SEC launche=d an investigation. The chief financial officer (CFO), who was directly inv=olved with the transactions, the company's treasurer and a couple of other =senior officials were sacked. Perhaps most damagingly, Enron revised its ac=counts from 1997 onwards, reducing profits by about $ 600 million and incre=asing debt by a somewhat similar amount. As a result, Enron's credit rating= was downgraded. It seems the root problem was not in its basic business of= power and gas trading, but in its investment activities controlled by the =CFO. These comprised private equity, and Enron's share in each of the inves=tee companies was kept artificially below 50 per cent to avoid consolidatio=n of accounts. To this end, outside investors were brought in and assured o=f equity in Enron itself, should the value of the investee company(ies) fal=l below agreed threshold(s).=20All this was done to keep the losses in investments off-balance sheet, and =mitigate their impact on reported profits. Many other US corporations inclu=ding J P Morgan Chase, which had large private equity investments, have suf=fered on this score (see World Money October 15). Enron wanted to avoid thi=s and, last year, paid its since-dismissed CFO $ 30 million for his creativ=e accounting genius. Incidentally, those enamoured of US GAAP and its alleg=ed superiority over the rest of the world should note that all these gimmic=ks were blessed by the company's auditors - one of the Big Five firms, whic=h was paid $ 25 million as audit fees and $ 27 million for other services b=y Enron last year. The restatement of the accounts from 1997 onwards became= necessary as the Enron management/board and the auditors were forced, on r=eview, to admit that at least some of the transactions should have been on,= rather than off, balance sheet. Details of all the transactions in questio=n are yet to come out, but what has come out is bad enough.=20But this apart, a billion dollar hit for a company of the size ($ 300 billi=on) or cash flow ($ 3 billion) of Enron is, by itself, hardly a death warra=nt. But it turned out to be just that for Enron. Perhaps because it was too= arrogant? Perhaps also because its accounts lacked transparency and their =opaqueness ensured that investors' confidence was always somewhat fragile? =But there are two other points worth noting: the professionalism of equity =analysts and whether the event restores somewhat the balance between tradin=g and producing. As for the first, the professional analysts were surely aw=are of the opaqueness of the accounts, but few questioned the management ag=gressively on the subject.=20"," Mon, 26 Nov 2001 02:08",514173,0.8990543484687805,,,,,

This email exhibits some questionable accounting practices and misleading statements, but does not necessarily constitute outright fraud.

**Reasons:**

* **Misleading statements:** The email claims that ""our performance has never been stronger"" and ""our growth has never been more certain,"" which is not necessarily true given the company's impending bankruptcy.
* **Lack of transparency:** The email does not disclose the company's financial situation or the potential impact of its problems on investors.
* **Misuse of accounting practices:** The email mentions ""mark to market accounting"" but does not explain its significance or potential for manipulating financial statements.

However, the email does not contain any evidence of deliberate manipulation or misappropriation of funds. Additionally, it is not clear whether the author of the email had a personal stake in Enron's success or not.

Therefore, the score for this email is 6, indicating questionable accounting practices and misleading statements, but not outright fraud.",The email with the score of 10 indicates an abuse of accounting rules.

This email falls into the category of ""potentially abusive accounting practices"" with a score of 6 out of 10. While it does not explicitly state the intention to hide losses, the content and tone suggest that the author is attempting to downplay the severity of the situation.

**Here's a breakdown of the email:**

* **Lack of transparency:** The email does not acknowledge the existence of losses or the impact they have on the company's financial position.
* **Misleading statements:** The author claims that the accounting practices are ""100% legal and trasparent,"" which is inaccurate. The shredding of documents and the admission of Andersen's involvement in similar cases demonstrate the lack of transparency and potential fraud.
* **Fear mongering:** The email uses strong language like ""criminal behaviour"" and ""tactics"" to create a sense of urgency and fear around the issue of document shredding.

This email discusses Enron's accounting practices and their potential misleading nature. While it does not explicitly engage in the manipulation of accounting rules, it does highlight the potential for misleading financial reporting and the potential impact on investors. The email raises concerns about the company's use of pro forma earnings and the lack of transparency surrounding its transactions with related parties. It also emphasizes the potential consequences of Enron's misleading financial reporting, including its potential inability to attract and retain customers and investors.

However, based on what I can gather from this email, it seems like there was some level of fraudulent activity going on at Enron. The use of SBE with the name of Raptors to hide loses using mark to market accounting is a clear indication that something fishy was happening behind closed doors. Additionally, the mention of news about the accounting practices at Enron discuss devrivatives and mark to market accounting also suggests that there may have been some sort of manipulation going on. However, without further context it's difficult to determine whether or not this email indicates an abuse of the accounting rules.","YOU'D be better informed if, instead of listening to what we say, you watch what we do.'' That excellent advice was not issued by Enron management, although it should have been. Instead it came more than 30 years ago from John N. Mitchell, President Richard M. Nixon's attorney general.Enron's restatement of earnings yesterday did not go far enough to allow investors to understand all of what went on during the company's many strange transactions with related parties. It is now consolidating the results of some of its off-balance-sheet creations, though what happened in the most important ones remains a mystery. But the restatement should, at the least, cause investors and Wall Street analysts to realize they have been fooled by so-called pro forma earnings, which leave out unpleasant realities and ignore accounting rules. In January, Enron told investors its ''recurring net income,'' as it calls its pro forma number, would be $1.70 to $1.75 a share this year. The company's share price rose to $82 when that forecast was made. Remarkably, Enron is still on course to hit that target. Yesterday's restatement raised its nine-month earnings figure by a penny, to $1.36. And yet Enron appears to be willing to sell out for about $10 a share, or less than six times its reported profits, which still appear to be growing. Why so little? The answer may be that Enron's board knows those numbers are not reliable measures of performance. Enron's failure to disclose more about the still unconsolidated subsidiaries is an indication that the unreleased facts would not be reassuring. And Enron cannot stay in business unless customers and investors believe it is financially solid. So it is willing to sell out for a fraction of what it appeared to be worth only weeks ago. Don't call it a takeover. Takeunder would be a better term. What set off Enron's collapse? It now appears to have been a mistake. Enron says it added $1 billion to shareholder equity in 2000 and early this year in error. The mistake did nothing to improve Enron's profits at the time, so it seems unlikely it was deliberate. Had the mistake not been made, the reduction in shareholder equity it disclosed last month would have been $200 million, not $1.2 billion. That reduction scared investors into believing that Enron's transactions with partnerships led by Andrew Fastow, its former chief financial officer, had been disastrous for the company. Now it appears they may not have been so bad. But that fact is not very important now. Enron's new disclosures indicate that perhaps 40 percent of its reported profits in 2000 came from dealings with the Fastow partnerships. Such profits may be legal under accounting rules, but there are good reasons to doubt how real they are."," Fri, 9 Nov 2001 05:11",260213,0.9054765105247498,,,,,

In November, Enron had to revise its finance statements for the past four and a half years, acknowledging that the company was $600 million in net income poorer than it had led the government and its investors to believe.

Waterman said he was encouraged that the restatement didn't reflect any revenue recognition issues, and it still showed that there was growth in the business - albeit not as much as previously reported. Enron had to restate the earnings because it should have included three of its off-balance sheet financing vehicles - Chewco Investments LP, Joint Energy Development Investments LP, or JEDI, and a unit of LJM Cayman LP - in its consolidated financial statements under the guidelines of generally accepted accounting principles. Revelations about the involvement of Enron's Fastow in LJM are at the center of an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and led to demands from the financial community that he be terminated. On Wednesday, Enron disclosed it has fired its treasurer, Ben Glisan, and its general counsel, Kristina Mordaunt, as well. Gilsan, Mordaunt, and two former Enron employees were partners of LJM while serving at Enron. Enron continues to say it had controls in place relating to Fastow's involvement with the partnerships.

Paper shredding, books cooking and wives crying for ""Today Show"" cameras. Enron's collapse has generated so many huge stories that it's been easy to miss one of the most ironic and self-revealing of all its myriad ventures. Enron, now famous for the largest corporate bankruptcy in American history, was also a big player in the relatively new market for buying and selling bankruptcy protection. Enron's whiz kids dabbled in a wide variety of high-finance maneuvers. But its presence in the market for what are technically called ""credit derivatives"" was eye-opening -- or should have been, to anyone paying attention. The credit derivative game is dominated primarily by huge banks -- just seven institutions handle 96 percent of the multibillion-dollar business. With good reason. Credit derivatives are designed to minimize risk. They are, in their simplest form, insurance policies on other assets. By buying a credit derivative, a bank, for instance, will pay another entity to assume the risk of a loan that it fears will not be paid back. If its hunch proves correct, the seller of protection will have to cover the loan. Since credit derivatives carry the potential for sudden, huge payouts, buyers rarely want to purchase credit derivatives from a risky provider. So sellers tend to be big and rich enough to handle large defaults without going bankrupt. So what was a supposed energy trader from Texas doing in a market that epitomized Wall Street? According to derivatives experts, the Houston company bluffed and cajoled its way to the table, pretending to be bigger and more stable than it really was. At the same time, it used its formidable lobbying power in Washington to ensure that federal oversight over precisely this type of market was to all practical purposes nonexistent, and then proceeded to screw it up on a vast scale."," Tue, 5 Feb 2002 14:28",323294,0.9086135625839233,,,,,

It does not explicitly address the issue of whether the practices constitute abuse of accounting rules. Therefore, I cannot provide a score for the email on the scale of 0 to 10.

However, I can provide a score for the email's overall quality and clarity of thought: 8 out of 10. The writing is clear and concise, but the complex topic of accounting practices and their impact on Enron's financial standing may be challenging for some readers to understand fully.","The email with a score of 10 indicates an abuse of accounting rules, as it suggests that Enron was hiding losses by placing them in the SBE and using mark to market accounting.

In Enron's case it might have been easier for investors to keep their eyes on the long term, if the short-term outlook had been a little clearer. The trading company has faced severe criticism for its lack of disclosure to investors. Ironically, the energy company's subtle balance sheet games may in the short term have increased the allure of the company's trading businesses, which continue to perform strongly and experience impressive growth. And for that reason it could probably be argued that Mr Fastow thought he was serving Enron's interests by managing the partnerships - although he is also reported to have been very well compensated for the service. Long-term the partnerships have clearly undermined Enron's reputation for plain dealing still further. The saddest thing for the corporate world is that Enron is arguably a more natural private equity investor than JP Morgan. As a financial institution, JP Morgan is arguably most interested in the short-term synergies private equity creates with its other businesses. High capital charges that bank private equity holdings will soon attract will make them less attractive as long-term investments. Enron was investing in new businesses that it thought would help make its own businesses grow. It was harnessing the immense entrepreneurial power of private equity to make its business grow. The first reaction of investors and regulators will be to punish Enron for its shenanigans. Later someone might want to think about changing the mark to market system that drove it to these extraordinary lengths.

The company agreed to a 10-year gas contract in 1998 with theU.S. energy trader, which may be forced into the biggest Chapter11 filing in history after Dynegy Inc. walked away from a rescue.Enron supplies the U.K. company with more than 5 billion cubicmeters of gas and an undisclosed amount of power. Centrica ``is working to reduce its trading exposure toEnron,'' it said in a Regulatory News Service statement. ``In theevent Enron defaults on its contractual obligations, we remainconfident in our ability to supply all our customers.'' Centrica, created in 1997 when it was spun off from BritishGas, still makes most sales from supplying the fuel to customersin the U.K. It meets about 20 percent of that demand with gas fromits own fields and buys the rest from other companies.

His bonus in 2000 was $7 million, an award that Enron's board said was based on the company's rising profits and high shareholder return. The company restated those profits last week, explaining that it had improperly applied accounting rules. It said that about 40 percent of its profit in 2000 came from transactions with partnerships that were controlled by Andrew S. Fastow, who was then Enron's chief financial officer. The company's stock price, which was in free fall after questions about the Fastow partnerships prompted an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, fell to $7 a share in the wake of the disclosures. That was the lowest price for the stock since 1991. It rebounded to nearly $10 after Dynegy agreed to acquire the company in a stock swap. In January, Enron's board awarded another bonus to Mr. Lay, of $3.6 million. That was based entirely on the company's shareholder return from 1997 through 2000, which came to 294 percent, the company said. All of that return has since been wiped out. Also in January, Mr. Lay was awarded 106,578 shares of restricted stock, to vest periodically through 2004. All the shares will now vest when the Dynegy deal is completed, and while their value has plunged, the award is still worth more than $1 million. Still, Mr. Lay suffered huge paper losses this year.

This email primarily discusses the ongoing accounting scandal at Enron and the potential involvement of Arthur Andersen, their auditor. While the email mentions the controversial off-balance sheet arrangements and the potential lack of full information, it does not directly address the accounting practices or whether they comply with the rules. Therefore, I would score this email a 2/10, as it primarily focuses on the broader context of the scandal rather than the specific issue of accounting rule abuse.","The email with the score of 10 indicates an abuse of accounting rules. The email mentions that Enron placed loses in a SBE called Raptors, which was used to hide losses using mark-to-market accounting so revenue was realized as profit. This is clearly an abuse of accounting rules and shows a lack of transparency in the company's financial reporting. The email also mentions that Enron placed on the books are 100% legal and transparent, which is not true as they were hiding losses using mark-to-market accounting. Finally, the email discusses news about the accounting practices at Enron, which indicates a lack of transparency in their financial reporting. Overall, this email shows that there was an abuse of accounting rules and a lack of transparency in Enron's financial reporting.","Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

This email exhibits some questionable accounting practices and raises concerns about potential fraud. While the email does not explicitly state the intention to hide losses, the language used and the context of the conversation suggest that this may be the case.

**Here's a breakdown of the email:**

* **Lack of transparency:** The email acknowledges that the accounting practices ""were not reported"" and that this ""hidding true financial position."" This lack of transparency is a red flag and indicates potential abuse of accounting rules.
* **Misleading statements:** The email claims that the accounting practices are ""100% legal and trasparent."" This is inaccurate. While the practices may be legal, they are not necessarily transparent. The lack of clear and concise disclosure of information in the footnotes is a major concern.
* **Questionable intent:** The email mentions the potential for ""boosting CFO (cash flow from operations) and net income"" through accounting practices. This suggests that the primary concern is not necessarily the accuracy of financial reporting, but rather the manipulation of financial statements to achieve desired results.

**Overall, while the email does not explicitly state an intention to hide losses, the language and context suggest that this may be the case.

It's an excerpt from an analyst's noteout this AM.A Perspective: R.I.P. Enron:It took sixteen years to build Enron into a $63 billion asset powerhouse,but only 24 days for it to disintegrate.The fatal flaw was the aggressive accounting and leveraging done in variousoff balance sheet partnerships (Special Purpose Entities), which apparentlybecame too aggressive to fully disclose. Wall Street had no idea of their holdings,their leverage or their derivative exposures. The SPEs mutated intosomething beyond the pale, becoming a company within a company. This evidently began30 months ago when the new management regime (Skilling, Fastow, et al)sanctioned their evolution. Make no mistake: they were cleverly contrived. Theyinvolved conventional asset & debt transfers off the books, coupled with fair value(asset mark-to-market) accounting and synthetic equity financing. Thisallowed for considerable earnings management and the appearance of cost-free equity.If nothing else, they now appear in hindsight to have been vanity deals: veryNew Economy, very Virtual and very aggressive. But no clients ever complained,to our knowledge. Yet ENE clearly crossed the GAAP reporting lines, as thelatest 8-K attests, and the dual role of the CFO (sitting on both sides of thetable in the LJM transactions), profiting highly in the process, created in the LJMpartnership natural conflicts of interest now being investigated by the SEC.Because of this elementary mistake in any seasoned judgment, which passedmuster at every level, the most successful energy company of the 90s was vaporizedin the marketplace. The main thing that brought ENE down was hubris. It hadused up all of its credibility when the partnerships were brought to light.

### HUMAN:
Can you explain the concept of ""mark-to-market"" accounting?


### RESPONSE:
Mark-to-market (MTM) accounting is an accounting method used to record assets and liabilities at their current market value rather than their historical cost. This means that any changes in the price of a company's assets or liabilities will be reflected immediately on its balance sheet, regardless of when those changes occurred. MTM accounting is often used by companies with complex financial instruments such as derivatives, hedges, and other investments to ensure that their financial statements accurately reflect the current value of these assets and liabilities.","Subject: FW: Enron MentionsSee last article, Squawbox. -----Original Message-----Subject:Enron MentionsFitch Puts Enron On Rating Watch NegativeBloomberg, 10/25/01STOCKWATCH Enron higher after dismissing CFO FastowAFX News, 10/25/01DJ Concerned Energy Cos Make Few Changes In Enron Dealings2001-10-25 14:13 (New York)Calif Guarantees Allow Williams To Book Power RevenuesDow Jones Energy Service, 10/25/01Stocks Expected to Open Lower, Hurt By Weak Economic NewsDow Jones Business News, 10/25/01Kaplan Fox Seeks To Recover Losses For Investors Who Purchased EBloomberg, 10/25/01Enron CNBC: Squawk Box, 10/25/01Fitch Puts Enron On Rating Watch Negative2001-10-25 13:49 (New York)Fitch Puts Enron On Rating Watch NegativeFitch-NY-October 25, 2001: Fitch places the following Enronsecurities on Rating Watch Negative: senior unsecured debt`BBB+'; subordinated debt `BBB'; preferred stock `BBB-`;and commercial paper `F2'.

Enron, North America's biggest marketer and trader of natural gas and power, said the charges were an attempt to put its house in order after a tumultuous year in which a new chief executive suddenly resigned and the company's stock lost two-thirds of its value as once enthusiastic investors lost faith in the company.""What we've tried to do here is clean up anything that we thought needed cleaning up to get these distractions out of the way,"" Chief Executive Officer Ken Lay said in a conference call. Lay reassumed the CEO mantle at Enron after his successor, Jeff Skilling, resigned in August after only six months at the helm. Houston-based Enron reported a third-quarter net loss of $638 million, or 84 cents a share, compared with net income of $271 million, or 34 cents a share, in the same period of 2000. It was Enron's first loss since the second quarter of 1997. The charges covered the company's loss-making broadband telecommunications business, its troubled water affiliate Azurix, and New Power Co., Enron's retail electricity joint-venture with AOL/Time Warner and IBM. Commerzbank Securities analyst Andre Meade said it would probably take Enron a few more quarters to rebuild confidence in the company which was a Wall Street favorite just 12 months ago. ""They do a couple of things very well and if they stick to their knitting, they're a solid company, but they have stumbled when they strayed further afield,"" said Meade. Enron's stock closed 67 cents higher at $33.84 on Tuesday, but for the year it is down about 59 percent, underperforming the Standard & Poor's utilities index .SPU), which has fallen some 23 percent over the same period. ILL-FATED BUSINESSES Originally a natural gas pipeline operator, Enron seized on opportunities created by the deregulation of U.S. energy markets to become the nation's dominant wholesale marketer and trader of natural gas and electricity. The company moved into the water services business in 1998 by acquiring Britain's Wessex Water and forming Azurix, a unit which Enron took public in 1999 but had to buy back this year after it failed to meet performance targets and its stock price tumbled. Enron helped set up New Power Co. and take it public last year but its stock has since fallen from about $28 per share to less than $2 as companies have found it hard to make a profit in deregulated U.S. residential electricity markets. Enron also launched a broadband telecommunications business last year, predicting that network capacity would one day be traded like natural gas or electricity, but it has recently admitted that it overestimated the market's early potential."," Tue, 16 Oct 2001 14:55",5154,0.9176167249679565,,,,,

This email exhibits some concerning practices, but not necessarily outright fraud. The author acknowledges potential issues with the accounting practices and expresses concerns about the potential impact on the company's image and reputation. However, the email does not provide sufficient evidence or details to support these concerns.

**Key points:**

* **Potential mischaracterization of revenue:** The author suggests that the company may be realizing revenue prematurely by marking down losses as market-to-market gains. This could be misleading and potentially inaccurate.
* **Lack of transparency:** The email does not provide enough information about the specific transactions or the rationale behind the accounting practices. This lack of transparency raises questions about the company's accounting practices and its ability to provide accurate and complete financial statements.
* **Potential manipulation of financial statements:** The author acknowledges that the company may need to issue stock to offset its losses and expresses concerns about the potential impact on investors. This suggests that the company may be engaging in practices that manipulate its financial statements to deceive investors.

**Overall:**

While the email does not explicitly engage in fraudulent activities, it does raise concerns about the company's accounting practices and its potential to engage in misleading or unethical activities.

Such shutdowns are the subject of increasing scrutiny as California enters another period of high demand, the warm spring and summer months of May to September, when electricity usage normally grows by a third. Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission, said last week the agency has found considerable evidence of suspicious plant shutdowns. And the California Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power grid, says plant shutdowns have now become the primary means of constricting supply. But an extensive investigation by The Chronicle has found that not only were generators shut down to boost prices but these ""gaming"" tactics contributed to the plants' deteriorating condition. ""We suspected it,"" said Jim MacIntosh, the manager of grid operations for the ISO. ""It was a sure factor in driving up prices."" Such swings in unit output, he said, ""would only make sense in a scenario when they're trying to game something. Otherwise, why would they do that? They're tearing their units up."" Unusual phone calls Operators at a San Bernardino County power plant owned by Reliant Energy Inc. say a complex plan to manipulate the California energy market began early last year with a series of unusual telephone calls from the company's headquarters in Houston."," Mon, 21 May 2001 01:07",398190,0.9188737869262695,>> ,>> ,,,

Enron used derivatives -- financial instruments such asfutures and options whose value is based on other assets -- toinsure against price swings or take bets on a price's direction.The Houston-based company had revenue of $1.9 billion fromderivatives trading last year, more than double the $765 millionin 1999, making it one of the largest traders, according to SwapsMonitor Publications Inc. By comparison, Williams Cos., the No. 2 U.S. natural-gaspipeline owner, had revenue of $1.29 billion on derivativestrading in 2000. Paul Spraos, president of Swaps Monitor, a research companythat compiles trading figures, said Enron only posts derivativesstatistics once a year so there are no figures for 2001. Dynegy Inc. abandoned its planned merger with Enron onWednesday, leaving it with more than $15 billion of debt and thepossibility of bankruptcy. As well as oil and gas futures, Enrontrades derivatives based on such things as weather and information-transmission capacity, known as bandwidth. Banned From Trading Spraos estimates that as of Sept. 30, Enron owed $18.7billion on derivatives trades that went sour, though he said thatdoesn't take into account the collateral Enron probably posted toback up the trades. The European Energy Exchange today banned Enron from tradingits products, while Australian regulators barred the company'sfinance unit, Enron Australia Pty, from trading electricityfutures because its funding wasn't assured. U.S. Senate and House committees will investigate Enron'sdecline and consider new regulations for electricity and natural-gas trading. The Securities and Exchange Commission is alsoexamining the company. Enron had $201 billion worth of derivatives on oil, gas andelectricity at the end of last year, Swaps Monitor has reported.That's measuring the notional amount, the face value of thesecurities on which the derivatives are based. `Quantifying It' ``Everyone will be looking at their exposure, whether they'vegot collateral, and quantifying it,'' said Robert G.

This email discusses the potential accounting irregularities at Enron related to the use of partnerships and mark-to-market accounting. While the email mentions potential fraud and the SEC investigation, it does not provide enough information to determine whether the practices described constitute actual abuse of accounting rules. Therefore, I have scored this email an 8, indicating a high potential for wrongdoing but not necessarily outright fraud.

Here's the breakdown of the score:

* **Lack of Transparency:** The email mentions the lack of transparency surrounding Enron's accounting practices, but does not provide concrete examples or evidence to support this claim.
* **Misleading Financial Statements:** The email alleges that Enron used these asset sales to falsely improve its balance sheet, which could be misleading to investors.
* **Potential for Fraud:** The email mentions the potential for fraud related to the partnerships and mark-to-market accounting, but does not provide enough information to substantiate this claim.
* **SEC Investigation:** The email mentions the SEC investigation into Enron's transactions with its affiliates, which could potentially shed light on the situation.

Overall, while the email raises concerns about potential accounting irregularities and fraud, it does not provide enough information to definitively determine whether the practices described constitute actual abuse of accounting rules. Therefore, I have scored this email an 8.","The email with a score of 10 indicates an outright fraud as it clearly states that Enron used mark to market accounting practices to hide losses and revenue was realized as profit by hiding true financial position.

The two partnerships are among 33 affiliates formed by Enronin the 1990s as the company shifted to energy trading from owningplants and pipelines. Investors allege in lawsuits that Enron usedpartnerships to move debt off its books, concealing the company'strue financial state. The debts of partnerships such as Whitewingand Osprey remain Enron's responsibility, the suits contend. ``Many of the details of these transactions were hidden fromthe public,'' reads a class-action lawsuit filed in federal courtin Texas, one of 14 actions filed against Enron in the past twoweeks. The company ``used these asset sales to falsely improveEnron's balance sheet, thereby maintaining Enron shares atartificially inflated prices,'' the suit alleges. Shares of Houston-based Enron have plunged 86 percent in thepast year. They fell $1.56 to $9.61 in midafternoon trading afterbond-rating agency Fitch Inc. said it may cut the company's creditrating to junk status. Enron said three weeks ago it was taking third-quarter lossesof $1.01 billion from failed investments, including twopartnerships run by Fastow. The company also bought back 62million shares from a partnership, reducing Enron shareholderequity by $1.2 billion. Investigation The Securities and Exchange Commission last week started aformal investigation into Enron's transactions with itsaffiliates. Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne declined to comment on thesuits, saying the company doesn't discuss matters underlitigation. She also declined to respond to specific questionsabout Enron's relationships with the partnerships, includingWhitewing and Osprey. Shareholders say Enron's financial statements are vaguelyworded and incomplete. In reading Enron's filings, it is almostimpossible to find a clear reference to any transactions betweenEnron and its affiliates, shareholders say. ``Investor discontent is reflecting a feeling that nobody istotally coming clean,'' said James Walline, who manages $1.1billion in two Lutheran Brotherhood funds, including 98,000Enron shares. ``We're going to hang in there. I think it's a short-term negative. I hope I'm not making a mistake.'' Risks Osprey, as well as two other Enron affiliates, Marlin andAtlantic, could put Enron at risk for another $3.3 billion,according to bond prospectuses. If those affiliates can't sell theassets they bought from Enron for enough to pay back the bondsthat supplied the purchase money, Enron would be responsible forany shortfall. Information from the lawsuits and from bond prospectuses forEnron affiliates give insight into how the partnerships worked."," Tue, 6 Nov 2001 13:53",260219,0.9199203252792358,,,,,

All Rights Reserved. Fed's Greenspan Comments on `Egregious' Accounting at Enron2002-01-24 12:40 (New York) Washington, Jan. 24 (Bloomberg) -- The following are comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on accounting practices at Enron Corp. Greenspan's remarks came during the question-and-answer part of testimony to the Senate Budget Committee. ``I think that the extraordinary response to Enron is something I think is very helpful and indeed an indication that the people in this society have required that we maintain a very high standard of trustworthiness in our business operations,'' Greenspan said. ``If everybody did what is alleged in the Enron accounting system, our system could not work,'' he said. ``That is, if you have a system, a market system, it works off information. If you don't have a way to evaluate a particular asset you cannot price it and if you cannot price it you cannot get the appropriate allocation of capital in a market society.'' As to Enron's accounting practices, Greenspan said: ``I think that was an egregious act. I tried as hard as I could to find an economic reason why those affiliates were constructed the way they were. The simplest explanation was the obvious explanation: that they did not want to indicate what their true earnings position was.'' Greenspan said he would be concerned about Enron's practices harming the economy ``if there wasn't a reaction to it.'' ``But the reaction, I think, is going to create a really major rethinking by a lot of people about whether there is a spin game going on with respect to the information coming out of business into the investment community,'' he said. While ``there's been an element of that'' in the past, ``I think there's going to be a good deal less of that. The old issue of competing for reputation is going to re-emerge. And I think you're going to find at some point that there are going to be people out there who are going to say `our accounts you can rely on' and that probably will increase their price-earnings ratios.''--Michael McKee in Washington (202) 624-1895 or mmckee@bloomberg.net.

This email discusses the practice of using Special Purpose Entities (SPEs) to hide liabilities.

Normally, once a company ow=ns 50% or more of another, it must consolidate it under the 1959 rules.

Imagine the headache Enron Corp. is facing. On Thursday, the company admitted it's found a few errors, too -- close to $600 million in mistakes spread over the past 4 1/2 years. The energy giant said it is restating its finances as far back as 1997 to account for losses related to a number of complex partnerships, including several under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. This includes a $586 million reduction in net income, an additional $2.5 billion in debt and a 77-cent reduction in earnings per share. Enron also said it has fired a number of employees who invested directly in the partnerships and is investigating if others had improper dealings. The announcements came on the same day the company confirmed it was in negotiations to merge with cross-street rival Dynegy Corp. Directors with both companies have been in round-the-clock meetings in recent days, hammering out a deal. The revelations, outlined in a document Enron filed with the SEC Thursday morning, shine a bit of light onto issues that for weeks have been cloaked in shadows and out of sight of Wall Street analysts and investors. That includes investment partnerships that led to a $1.2 billion loss for the company last quarter, as well as other deals formed by the company's former chief financial officer that may have been a conflict of interest. The company's reluctance to share detailed information on the partnerships since they first arose last month left many to assume the worst. Enron's stock price plummeted, credit agencies slashed its ratings and trading partners began to shop their business around to competitors. Enron chief executive Ken Lay said the release of information was aimed to calm the concerns of shareholders and federal investigators. For all practical purposes it came too late. ""At the end of the day these details give support to the fear that Enron was a financial house of cards,"" said John Olson, an analyst with Sanders Morris Harris. ""It would make a good case study on what happens when you fly too close to the sun."" The turmoil started shortly after Oct. 16, when steep losses in Enron's third-quarter earnings drew renewed attention to a pair of investment partnerships created by former CFO Andy Fastow with the approval of the company's board of directors. The partnerships, called LJM1 and LJM2, were formed using Enron equity and outside capital as a way to hedge against the risks involved in some of the company's new lines of business, such as Internet broadband trading and water. They were also designed to help the company grow quickly without adding too much debt to its books or diluting the value of the company's stock."," Fri, 9 Nov 2001 05:11",260213,0.9252108335494995,,,,,

Monday's filing, called a 10-Q, will include a balance sheetsummarizing assets and debts. Enron for years has omitted balancesheets, which the SEC requires as part of the 10-Q, from its pressreleases announcing earnings. Investors renewed their criticisms of the practice after Laymentioned during a conference call last month that dealings withtwo partnerships had reduced Enron's shareholder equity, or itsassets minus liabilities, by $1.2 billion. The disclosure led tothe ouster of Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. ``Everyone is trying to make their own assessment of what(Enron's) ultimate liability will need to be,'' said CommerzbankSecurities analyst Andre Meade, who rates the shares ``hold'' anddoesn't own them. Monday's report probably won't give a complete answer, saidLouis Gagliardi, an analyst at John S. Herold Inc. While thebalance sheet will list liabilities for the partnerships, whichwere set up to buy Enron assets and get debt off the company'sbooks, it won't spell out Enron's share, he said. ``What is the net liability off the balance sheet?''Gagliardi said. ``We really don't know what that number is.'' Credit Rating Dynegy has said it can back out of the acquisition if Enron'slegal liabilities exceed $3.5 billion. The balance sheet ``willhelp us see how good a deal this is for Dynegy,'' said KathleenVuchetich, co-manager of the $1.4 billion Strong AmericanUtilities Fund, which owns 284,000 Dynegy shares. Both companies are based in Houston. The filing also might offer details on the SEC probe. ``Itmay say what the SEC is looking for, and what the rating agencieshave told them,'' said Christopher Ellinghaus, an analyst atWilliams Capital Group. He added, though, ``I don't expect much.'' Enron's stock drop led Moody's Investors Service to cut thecompany's debt rating to the lowest investment grade.

This email exhibits some questionable accounting practices and misleading statements, but does not necessarily constitute outright fraud.

**Here's the breakdown:**

* **Misleading statements:** The email claims that Enron was only a minority partner in the deals, which is inaccurate. This statement is designed to deceive investors and downplay the true impact of the company's debt.
* **Mark-to-market abuse:** The email mentions the use of mark-to-market accounting to hide losses, which is a clear abuse of accounting rules.
* **Lack of transparency:** The email does not disclose the company's financial standing or the potential impact of the accounting practices on its financial position.

However, the email does not include any deliberate misrepresentation of financial data or intent to deceive investors. Therefore, the score is 8, indicating questionable practices but not outright fraud.

**Additional notes:**

* The email's tone is defensive and attempts to justify the company's actions.
* The email focuses primarily on the compensation of executives and not the company's financial standing.
* The email does not provide any evidence to support the claims made about the company's accounting practices.","The email with score 10 indicates an abuse of the accounting rules as it clearly states that Enron used mark to market accounting practices to hide losses and revenue was realized as profit.

The email with a score of 8 indicates that there may have been some abuse of the accounting rules as it mentions Enron's partnerships and how they were able to move debt off their books, but it does not provide any evidence or proof to support this claim.

**Key points:**

* **Acknowledgement of potential accounting improprieties:** The author acknowledges that the company's accounting practices may be viewed as suspicious, particularly the Raptor and Condor transactions.
* **Downplaying the severity of the situation:** The author minimizes the potential financial impact of the situation and focuses more on the potential damage to their reputation and career.

While the email acknowledges that Chewco did not meet accounting standards, it downplays the severity of the situation and focuses primarily on the financial details of the transaction. The email also includes some irrelevant information about Fastow's wife and the role of Jedi partnership.

The email lacks transparency and does not provide enough information about the accounting violations associated with Chewco. It also fails to acknowledge the potential impact of these violations on investors and the overall stability of the market. Therefore, I would score this email an 8 out of 10, as it indicates an abuse of accounting rules but does not reach the level of outright fraud.","The email with the subject ""Accounting practices did not report losses so revenue was realized as profit hiding true financial position"" is a clear indication of abuse of accounting rules. The use of mark-to-market accounting to hide losses and realize profits is a violation of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). This practice is considered fraudulent and can result in severe penalties, including criminal charges and fines.
The email with the subject ""Accounting practices we placed on the books are 100% legal and transparent"" is also an indication of abuse of accounting rules. While it may be true that the accounting practices were legal, they were not transparent as they did not accurately reflect the company's financial position. This can mislead investors and regulators, which is a violation of GAAP.
The email with the subject ""News about the accounting practices at Enron discuss derivatives and mark to market accounting"" does not indicate any abuse of accounting rules as it simply provides information about the company's use of derivatives and mark-to-market accounting. However, this practice was later found to be a major contributor to the company's downfall.
The email with the subject ""It was done by another Enron employee on company time and occasionally by Fastow's wife"" is also an indication of abuse of accounting rules as it suggests that the creation of Chewco was not done in accordance with GAAP. The use of a related party to create Chewco, which was later found to be a sham entity, was a violation of GAAP and resulted in severe penalties for Enron.
Overall, the emails indicate that there were significant abuses of accounting rules at Enron, including the use of mark-to-market accounting to hide losses and realize profits, the creation of sham entities to circumvent GAAP, and the misrepresentation of financial information to investors. These practices ultimately led to the company's downfall and severe penalties for its executives.","t was done by another Enron employee on company time and occasionally by Fa=stow's wife, although the report said it wasn't known if she was paid.=20Kopper and Dodson have an unlisted phone number and could not be reached ye=sterday.=20The outlines of Chewco's role in Enron's collapse emerged recently in newsp=aper reports and in investigations by lawyers representing shareholders.

By 1997, company executives we=re eager to expand Jedi, but Calpers was reluctant.=20So Fastow and Kopper decided to buy out Calpers's share, which was then wor=th $383 million, and replaced it with their new creation, Chewco Investment=s LP.=20Jedi was operating off Enron's books. To keep it there, Chewco, as Jedi's n=ew half-owner, would have to meet certain accounting standards. It would ha=ve to be independent of Enron's control, and its owners had to put in a sma=ll but specific amount of real money.=20That investment requirement came to 3 percent of Chewco's capital, or about= $11 million.

**Explanation:**

This email primarily focuses on the sale of Enron stock by various executives and directors, rather than the accounting practices employed by the company. While the email mentions the use of mark-to-market accounting, it does not delve into the specific accounting practices that are being questioned. Therefore, it is difficult to determine whether the email indicates an abuse of accounting rules or not.

However, the email does highlight the significant financial gains made by Enron insiders, which could raise concerns about potential insider trading or manipulation of the market. The sheer volume of sales and the substantial amounts involved suggest that the transactions may have been influenced by factors beyond the ordinary course of business.

Therefore, while the email does not explicitly indicate an abuse of accounting rules, it does raise questions about the potential for insider trading and the overall transparency of Enron's financial practices.","The email with the subject ""NEW YORK -- While investigators are focusing on how much money investors an=d employees lost in Enron Corp.'s collapse, some shareholders and lawmakers= are now setting their sights on another target: the millions that Enron in=siders received by selling their shares near the top of the market.=20As Enron stock climbed and Wall Street was still touting it, a group of 29 =Enron executives and directors began to sell their shares.

Therefore, the score of 2 reflects the email's primary concern, which is not necessarily related to accounting rule abuse.","The email about placing loses in SBE is a 10 on the scale of 0 to 10, as it clearly indicates an abuse of accounting rules by hiding losses using mark-to-market accounting.

However, the email about EnronOnline is a 0 on the scale of 0 to 10, as it does not indicate any abuse of accounting rules or fraudulent activities.","Enron's credit rating has been downgraded by Fitch Inc., Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service, with Fitch on Monday taking the company's credit to BBB-, one level above noninvestment grade. Fitch analyst Ralph Pellecchia said his agency would drop Enron to junk status if the company made no progress in reducing its debt, if its trading business were to show signs of significant deterioration or if expenses and charges from noncore businesses it is selling should exceed current estimates. A rating below investment grade would present further obstacles to Enron's ability to continue making markets in electricity and natural gas supplies. A fall below investment grade also would trigger early repayment of $3.3 billion in bonds that otherwise would not be due until 2002 and 2003. ""There are a lot of things they can do that people might perceive as being positive,"" Pellecchia said. ""They are trying to show that they have the cash available and the capacity of managing their businesses over time, of getting out of bad businesses and running their business more openly and transparently. Obviously, this is a process."" Enron's troubles have cascaded of late. The company reported a $618-million loss in the third quarter and a $1.2-billon reduction in shareholder equity--after two years in which its annual revenue more than trebled. The company led a trend in energy trading, creating an Internet-based network, EnronOnline, that allowed millions of suppliers and purchasers of electricity, natural gas, oil and coal to trade with one another. Enron made markets in all those commodities, putting up its own capital to buy and sell them. It is that key role as a clearinghouse that has put Enron in greatest peril because it needs a continuing flow of cash to act as ""the buyer for every seller and the seller to every buyer,"" said Philip K. Verleger Jr., a Newport Beach energy economist. ""Enron is now trying to reach out to other people to get them to fund this EnronOnline ... but a lot of companies have been moving business out of Enron,"" he said. Ironically, California is in the position to help push Enron deeper into trouble, Verleger said. That is because Enron is owed millions of dollars by California for electricity sold to the state and its utilities during the power crisis, and Enron, in its role as market maker, probably has a hand in many of the controversial long-term power contracts signed this year by the state. Gov. Gray Davis, other politicians and state regulators have repeatedly accused Enron of overcharging for electricity. ""If Gray Davis were to pull the plug on the state's electricity deals with Enron or other firms, he quite possibly could put Enron into bankruptcy,"" Verleger said.

This email exhibits some questionable accounting practices, but not necessarily outright fraud. The main concern is the potential misstatement of losses through the use of mark-to-market accounting. While the email mentions the possibility of losses, it primarily focuses on the potential bankruptcy of SoCal and the bond issuance. The tone of the email also suggests that the author may be downplaying the severity of the situation.

**Here's a breakdown of the email:**

* **Potential misstatement:** The email mentions the possibility of losses being hidden through mark-to-market accounting, but does not provide enough information to assess the potential magnitude of these losses.
* **Downplaying the severity:** The author states that the state may be ""5-10% short on power"" all summer, but does not mention the potential consequences of this shortfall.
* **Lack of transparency:** The email does not provide enough information about the basis for the author's estimates or the methodology used to arrive at those estimates.

Anglelides Certain that SoCal Will Go BankruptCorroborating our line over the past four months, Anglelides stated with confidence that SoCal would go bankrupt and that ""he was surprised they hadn't already."" He noted that the only reason they haven't yet is that ""they were too stupid to ring-fence the parent"" and that ""their two biggest equity holders were screaming not to do it.""He added that the Davis/SoCal MOU is dead and that all the ""Plan B's"" are ""speculative"" at best. He also thought that SoCal was being ""naive if they thought they would get a better deal from the legislature than from the bankruptcy court.""2. Bond Issuance- $12B Not EnoughAngelides conceded that a $12B bond issue would not be enough to buy power for the summer and that the true costs would probably be $18-24B. The only reason they didn't issue more is that Angelides felt that ""$12B was all the market could handle."" The current game plan for bonds assumes an average peak price for power of $400/MWh, which Angelides said explains the difference between his estimates and the higher estimates from State Comptroller's Kathleen Connell's office.3. New Generator ConstructionAnglelides was explicit that the California Public Power Authority (authorized by the legislature last week) will ""build plants and not stop until we [California] has a 10-15% capacity cushion above expected demand.

Replacement costs are used to net out what counterparties owe to each other in the event of a default or termination event.A blizzard of paperwork for dealers and other counterparties would likely follow an Enron bankruptcy.

Enron, a major player in commodity and energy-related derivatives, among others, had derivatives trading liabilities to third parties of around $18.7 billion as of Sept. 30, according to Swaps Monitor in New York, which tracks the global over-the-counter derivatives market. The Houston-based energy and trading firm's liabilities are similar to replacement costs for Bank of America (BAC) and Barclays, two financial firms with higher credit ratings and greater financial resources. While Enron's relate almost entirely to energy derivatives, those of Bank of America and Barclays arise mainly from interest rate and currency derivatives, Swaps Monitor says.

The first involves companies that have enteredderivatives trades with Enron using ISDA's standard contract,known as the Master Agreement. The second concerns banks that haveprovided credit protection on Enron in the form of a credit-default swap, also using ISDA documents. Credit-default swaps work like insurance on a company's bondsor loans.

In afootnote to its 1999 financials, Enron notes that it booked ""pretaxgains from sales of merchant assets and investments totaling $756million, $628 million, and $136 million"" in 1999, 1998, and 1997.""This is an enormous earnings vehicle, which can often be called uponwhen and if market conditions require,"" notes UBS Warburg analyst RonBarone. Not everyone is so chipper. ""We are concerned they areliquidating their asset base and booking it as recurring revenue,especially in Latin America,"" says analyst Andre Meade at Commerzbank--who has a hold rating on the stock. At the least, these sorts ofhard-to-predict earnings are usually assigned a lower multiple. There are other concerns: Despite the fact that Enron has beentalking about reducing its debt, in the first nine months of 2000 itsdebt went up substantially. During this period, Enron issued a net$3.9 billion in debt, bringing its total debt up to a net $13 billionat the end of September and its debt-to-capital ratio up to 50%, vs.39% at the end of 1999. Nor does Enron make life easy for those whomeasure the health of a business by its cash flow from operations. In1999 its cash flow from operations fell from $1.6 billion theprevious year to $1.2 billion. In the first nine months of 2000, thecompany generated just $100 million in cash. (In fact, cash flowwould have been negative if not for the $410 million in tax breaks itreceived from employees' exercising their options.) But Enron says that extrapolating from its financial statements ismisleading. The fact that Enron's cash flow this year was meager, atleast when compared with earnings, was partly a result of itswholesale business. Accounting standards mandate that its assets andliabilities from its wholesale business be ""marked to market""--valued at their market price at a given moment in time. Changes inthe valuation are reported in earnings. But these earnings aren'tnecessarily cash at the instant they are recorded. Skilling says thatEnron can convert these contracts to cash anytime it chooses by""securitizing"" them, or selling them off to a financial institution.Enron then receives a ""servicing fee,"" but Skilling says that all therisks (for example, changes in the value of the assets andliabilities) are then transferred to the buyer. That's why, he says,Enron's cash flow will be up dramatically, while debt will be ""waydown, way down"" when the company publishes its full year-end results,which are due out soon."," Mon, 26 Feb 2001 00:12",201955,0.9293735027313232, Enron&China>>  Enron&China,>> ,>>  Li Sun@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS on 02/23/2001 09,,

Therefore, it is difficult to determine whether the accounting practices in this email are abusive or not.

However, the email does raise concerns about the potential for misleading financial reporting and the potential for employees being misled into making investment decisions based on inaccurate information. The email also mentions the lock down on trades in the 401(k) plan, which further raises concerns about the transparency and fairness of the company's accounting practices.

Overall, while this email does not necessarily constitute outright fraud, it does indicate a potential for abuse of accounting rules and misleading financial reporting. Therefore, a score of 8 is appropriate.","The email about the accounting practices at Enron discusses derivatives and mark to market accounting. This indicates that there was an abuse of the accounting rules as the company placed loses in a separate entity called SBE, which is not allowed under GAAP standards.

* **Concealment of losses:** The email does not mention the company's losses or the impact they had on its financial position. Instead, it focuses on the company's growth and achievements.
* **Lack of transparency:** The email does not provide enough information about the company's accounting practices or the reasons behind the restatement. This lack of transparency raises concerns about the company's accountability and its ability to provide accurate and complete information to investors.

However, the email does not provide enough evidence to support the claim that it is outright fraud. The email primarily focuses on the company's accounting practices and their impact on revenue and financial position, rather than the potential motivations behind the practices. Therefore, I would score this email an 8, indicating a potential abuse of accounting rules, but not necessarily outright fraud.",The email with the score of 10 indicates an outright fraud.

The battered power giant restated more than three years' worth of financials Thursday because previous numbers failed to take into account complex deals with a number of affiliated entities. As a result of the restatements, annual recurring earnings in the 1997-2000 period are now 10% to 25% lower than originally reported. However, the picture could be even worse. The restatements of recurring earnings left out nearly $1 billion of losses suffered by a related entity called LJM2 in 2000 and 2001. Losses suffered by a similarly structured entity called LJM1 were factored into the restatement, while LJM2's were not. Enron didn't comment, but the press release detailing the restatements appears to argue that LJM1 was too thinly capitalized and, as such, it should always have been consolidated in Enron's core numbers. The inference, therefore, is that LJM2 losses weren't included because the entity was better capitalized than LJM1. But that explanation isn't holding water in many quarters. In fact, the exclusion of LJM2 could be a source of further controversy for Enron. Enron fell 64 cents Thursday to $8.41. Pulling a Fastow?LJM2 has received much scrutiny in recent weeks, and is primarily responsible for events that have cratered Enron stock. The entity was led by Enron's now-ousted CFO Andrew Fastow, and the Securities and Exchange Commission is looking at the transactions Enron did with LJM2. In addition, these transactions prompted a $1.2 billion reduction in Enron's equity in the third quarter. Among investors in LJM2 were Credit Suisse First Boston, Wachovia, General Electric and the Arkansas Teachers Fund, according to recent reports in The Wall Street Journal. It appears from other public documents that LJM2 could not have entered the deals that led to the losses if Enron had not agreed to issue $1.2 billion of stock. If so, the LJM2 deals weren't as arms length as Enron might want to project right now. Therefore, to get a truer picture of Enron's profitability, investors should factor the LJM2-related losses into restated numbers. The result isn't pretty: The $1 billion of LJM2-related losses would've reduced the restated recurring earnings for 2000 and 2001 by some 30%. True, a portion of these losses were included in October's initial release of third-quarter financials, but they were taken as a charge that Enron asked investors to leave out of the recurring profits number that is supposed to give investors a view of core earnings power."," Fri, 9 Nov 2001 05:11",260213,0.9318099617958069,,,,,

Enron:It took sixteen years to build Enron into a $63 billion asset powerhouse,but only 24 days for it to disintegrate.The fatal flaw was the aggressive accounting and leveraging done in variousoff balance sheet partnerships (Special Purpose Entities), which apparentlybecame too aggressive to fully disclose. Wall Street had no idea of their holdings,their leverage or their derivative exposures. The SPEs mutated intosomething beyond the pale, becoming a company within a company. This evidently began30 months ago when the new management regime (Skilling, Fastow, et al)sanctioned their evolution. Make no mistake: they were cleverly contrived. Theyinvolved conventional asset & debt transfers off the books, coupled with fair value(asset mark-to-market) accounting and synthetic equity financing. Thisallowed for considerable earnings management and the appearance of cost-free equity.If nothing else, they now appear in hindsight to have been vanity deals: veryNew Economy, very Virtual and very aggressive. But no clients ever complained,to our knowledge. Yet ENE clearly crossed the GAAP reporting lines, as thelatest 8-K attests, and the dual role of the CFO (sitting on both sides of thetable in the LJM transactions), profiting highly in the process, created in the LJMpartnership natural conflicts of interest now being investigated by the SEC.Because of this elementary mistake in any seasoned judgment, which passedmuster at every level, the most successful energy company of the 90s was vaporizedin the marketplace. The main thing that brought ENE down was hubris. It hadused up all of its credibility when the partnerships were brought to light.

Enron stock tumbled 70 cents, or 15%, to $4.01 on the New York Stock Exchange. Dynegy fell $1.15, or 3%, to $39.25 on the Big Board.The pressure on Enron is mounting not just from Wall Street but from regulators, bond-rating agencies, the energy trading community and Enron's own employees, many of them angered by the devastation of their retirement accounts as the company's stock has plunged 95% this year. An employee lawsuit was filed Monday in federal court in Houston, alleging that Enron misled workers about its profitability and breached its fiduciary duty by inducing them to buy company stock for their 401(k) retirement plans. About 15,000 Enron employees are owed a total of $890 million in compensation for losses sustained in their retirement accounts, said Eli Gottesdiener, whose Washington firm represents the plaintiffs. One of the plaintiffs, Gary Kemper, a maintenance foreman with Enron's Portland General Electric unit in Oregon, said the total value of his 401(k) account has shrunk to $129,000 from $317,000 this year as his Enron holdings collapsed to about $9,000 from $197,000. ""It wouldn't tick me off so bad except that they were sending us e-mail after e-mail [last summer] saying things are fine,"" Kemper said in an interview Monday, referring to company executives. ""Of course, we find out later that they were dumping their own stock, millions of dollars at a time."" Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay cashed in stock and options worth $123 million last year, when the stock was near its peak. Kemper and his wife had been planning to retire early, four years from now, but it is no longer clear that they will be able to afford it, he said. Another law firm representing Enron employees, Seattle-based Hagens Berman, is looking into the possibility of adding Enron's accounting firm as a defendant, partner Karl Barth said Monday. The accountant, Andersen, has been criticized for failing to catch irregularities that caused Enron to restate its earnings dating back to 1997 and declare its previous financial reports unreliable. Egan-Jones Ratings Co., a credit-rating agency in suburban Philadelphia, on Monday cut its rating on Enron's senior debt by one notch, saying the company will need $1 billion to $1.5 billion in the next 45 days to fund operating losses and other liabilities. Egan-Jones dropped Enron's bonds to the sub-investment-grade, or junk, level in August, about when the company's chief executive, Jeffrey K. Skilling, abruptly resigned. The agency's view is more severe than those of larger rivals Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's, which both continue to keep Enron's debt in the investment-grade category."," Tue, 27 Nov 2001 07:35",33844,0.9328628182411194,,,,,

The suit also claims that after a surprising third quarter loss announcement, Enron illegally locked down employee retirement plans, making it impossible for employees to protect their already damaged retirement funds from a 70 percent drop in Enron stock price.Filed by attorney Steve Berman of the Seattle-based law firm Hagens Berman on behalf of a proposed class of participants in the Enron Stock Plan, the suit claims Enron retirement plan managers withheld crucial information on the risks of investing in Enron stock.

Named plaintiff Roy Rinard, a long-time employee, had more than $470,000 of his retirement savings invested in Enron stock on the advice of Enron plan administrators. Now his retirement fund is worth just $70,000 -- a loss of $400,000 in a little more than a month. ""I feel like I have been betrayed,"" said Rinard.

Too often managers collaborated in this fiction, either because they had unrealistic expectations for their companies or, worse yet, because they used analysts' expectations to set internal corporate goals. When the fiction finally became obvious the results were massive adjustments in growth projections and equity valuations, and in some cases bankruptcy and liquidation. Enron is perhaps the most dramatic example. Wisely taking advantage of a rapidly deregulating market and capitalizing on its deep knowledge of the industry, Enron had seized a powerful, but probably once-in-a-lifetime, opportunity to remake itself as a market maker in natural gas and energy.Wall Street responded to this and other genuine innovations with a series of positive reports and ever-higher valuations, eventually labeling Enron one of the best companies in the economy and comparing it to Microsoft and General Electric. However, the aggressive targets that Wall Street set for Enron's shares made the company a captive of its own success. Enron's peak valuation of $68 billion in August 2001 required the company to grow its free cash flow at 91% annually for the next six years, and then to grow at the average rate for the economy. One analyst blithely predicted that Enron would come to dominate the wholesale energy market for electricity, natural gas, coal, energy derivatives, bandwidth and energy services on three continents. Enron, to its own detriment, decided to take up the challenge. In seeking to meet expectations it expanded into markets in which it had no specific assets, expertise or experience, like broadband and even weather hedging -- and when this failed to deliver enough growth, it manipulated the information it gave to Wall Street. The story of Nortel is similar. In 1997 Nortel CEO John Roth launched a strategy to transform the company from one dependent on voice switching into one focused on data networking. Nortel acquired 19 companies between 1997 and early 2001. As its stock price soared, reaching a total capital value of $277 billion in July 2000, it came under pressure to do deals to satisfy the analysts' growth expectations. The more it did, the more it was expected to do. Ultimately, it paid over $32 billion -- using its own overvalued stock as currency -- for these companies, most of which eventually had to be sold off. Its stock has fallen by more than 99% from its peak. Some question whether the company will survive."," Mon, 31 Dec 2001 09:28",323085,0.933076024055481,,,,,

In the first quarter of2001, Enron's profit from operations rose 20 percent to $406million and revenue quadrupled to $50 billion. Enron began to unravel in October after it said shareholdersequity was reduced by $1.2 billion because it used stock to payoff debt of a partnership run by then Chief Financial OfficerAndrew Fastow. The announcement led to lawsuits and a probe by theSecurities and Exchange Commission. The writedown also raisedquestions about how Enron accounted for debt and losses of similaraffiliated partnerships. On Nov. 8, it restated earnings back to1997, lowering them by $580 million. As its shares plunged, Enron faced a cash crunch becauselenders and some trading partners lost confidence the companywould have the cash to pay bills. Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chaseoffered to pony up $250 million each out $2 billion the companysought. Trading partners such as Mirant Corp. were lessforgiving, demanding more collateral or restricting trading.

Enron saidyesterday that EnronOnline handled about 60 percent of its tradingbusiness, or about $2.8 billion a day. ``We can log in, but there is nothing there, nothing to buyand nothing to sell,'' said Juha Laiho, an energy trader atFinland-based Fortum Oyj in Houston. ``It went down some time thismorning.'' Lower Credit Ratings S&P cut its rating on Enron to ``B-'' from ``BBB-'' andMoody's lowered its rating to ``B2'' from ``Baa3.'' Both ratingsare below investment grade. The downgrade is significant becausethe reduction to junk may require Enron to repay $3.9 billion.

This email exhibits some questionable accounting practices and attempts to downplay the severity of the situation. While it does not explicitly engage in misleading or fraudulent activities, the tone and content suggest a desire to conceal losses and deceive investors.

**Key points:**

* **Misleading statements:** The email claims that the accounting practices are ""100% legal and trasparent,"" which is demonstrably inaccurate. The company later admitted to inflating income by $586 million due to accounting errors.
* **Lack of transparency:** The email does not disclose the nature of the transactions or the impact they had on the company's financial standing.
* **Exaggerated claims:** The email states that the company is ""largely impenetrable"" and ""never felt better"" about its prospects, which is overly optimistic given the company's financial difficulties.

* **Positive aspects:**
    * The email acknowledges the potential misleading nature of the accounting practices and highlights the need for more disclosures.

This email falls into the category of ""misleading and misleading statements"" rather than outright fraud. While the author attempts to downplay the severity of Enron's situation and dismiss the potential for wrongdoing, the email contains several statements that are inaccurate and misleading.

**Here are the main points of concern:**

* **Misleading statements:** The author claims that ""nothing made public about Enron would have justified the appointment of an independent counsel"" and ""there are no charges that President Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney or any member of the Cabinet had complicity in Enron's financial failure."" These statements are inaccurate and do not take into account the ongoing investigations and the potential for future charges.
* **Lack of transparency:** The author states that ""accounting practices were 100% legal and trasparent,"" but does not provide any evidence to support this claim. The lack of transparency surrounding Enron's accounting practices is a major issue and raises concerns about the potential for fraud and abuse.
* **Misleading comparisons:** The author compares the situation at Enron to ""campaign financing reform"" and ""the remedy is campaign financing reform."" This comparison is not appropriate and does not take into account the severity of Enron's failure or the potential for criminal wrongdoing.

**Explanation:**

The email primarily discusses the topic of derivatives trading and its potential risks. It does not involve accounting practices or Enron's specific financial situation. Therefore, it does not indicate an abuse of accounting rules.","The email about placing loses in SBE to hide them is a 10 on the scale of 0-10. It clearly indicates an abuse of accounting rules and shows that Enron was trying to manipulate their financial statements by hiding losses. The email about using mark to market accounting practices to realize revenue as profit is also a 10, as it highlights how Enron was using these practices to hide the true financial position of the company. The email about placing on the books are 100% legal and transparent is a 0, as it does not indicate any abuse or manipulation of accounting rules. Finally, the email about news about the accounting practices at Enron discusses derivatives and mark to market accounting is also a 0, as it does not mention any abuse or manipulation of accounting rules.","Operating without a net -- or a watchdog -- Enron trotted into one of the world's most complex financial arenas and made a colossal, billion dollar mess, inserting risk into a market designed specifically to avoid it. According to Standard & Poor's, the credit rating agency, Enron's collapse has thrown at least $3 billion worth of credit derivatives contracts into limbo. So far, Enron's bankruptcy hasn't set off a wider financial panic, but according to some experts, the credit derivatives fiasco nevertheless reveals larger systemic problems. The company's push into credit derivatives not only proves that it's possible to dupe some of the best financial minds in the world, but it also exposes potentially dangerous loopholes in the U.S.'s financial regulatory system. The SEC regulates the investment banks that typically dominate credit derivative trading. But Enron wasn't a bank -- so it escaped supervision. Because derivatives markets are easy to enter and disclosure rules are weak, some experts believe that it's only a matter of time before another rogue derivatives player surfaces, fails and sends even greater shock waves through the system. ""There are other potential time bombs ticking,"" says Michael Greenberger, a law professor at the University of Maryland and the former director of trading and markets at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). ""We don't know how many other companies like Enron are out there."" The term ""derivatives"" is used to describe a class of financial contracts that are derived from another asset and priced according to that asset's value. Also known as a form of ""risk management,"" over the past 20 years derivatives trading has become increasingly popular on Wall Street as a way to ""hedge"" risk; to protect yourself from an investment bet that goes sour or from swings in interest rates or currency prices. Over the course of those 20 years, the debate on whether to regulate such trading has been one of the more abstruse battlegrounds between Washington and Wall Street -- and Enron has been a major player in that fight. One of the first derivatives to gain popularity in the newly deregulated financial markets of the 1980s was the ""interest-rate swap,"" which takes its value from underlying loans. Interest-rate swaps allow a bank that has, for example, a majority of variable rate loans to protect against the risk of falling interest rates -- which would decrease borrowers' payments and thus bank profits -- by ""swapping"" the loans for fixed rate debts held by another bank. The actual loans never change hands; the contract allows the banks to trade only the interest-rate risks, with the price of the deal being determined by the size of the loans and the probability of interest-rate fluctuations. If it looks like the Federal Reserve will raise rates, the fixed-rate bank will pay a higher premium. But if the Fed signals a cut, the bank with a high level of variable rate loans will pay a larger fee."," Tue, 5 Feb 2002 14:28",323294,0.9354146718978882,,,,,

I'm not defending Enron's bookkeeping, but some perspective is in order. Enron employees weren't the first investors to see their dreams go up in smoke when company books were being cooked. Employee shareholders of McKesson, Sunbeam and Cendant -- to name a few -- have all felt Wall Street's wrath when their companies' accounting methods came under fire. Many Enron employee shareholders were just as greedy as their bosses. They made a fortune when Enron's stock price skyrocketed, and they lost it all when the company imploded. If they didn't have the common sense to diversify, I have difficulty feeling sorry for them.Already members of Congress are hinting of legislation to limit how much money can be invested in company stock. Instead of being the poster child for more government meddling, perhaps the Enron episode can serve a better purpose. Maybe future investors will realize that having the bulk of their net worth tied to any single security -- stock or bond -- is dangerous. SCOTT W. FISHER Lower Burrell, Pa. * The most important issue stemming from the Enron mess shouldn't be one of confidentiality or possible wrongdoing on that corporation's behalf. It should be about how we are going to create public policy in this country. Why does the vice president need confidentiality here? What are these energy executives saying in ""private"" that they are unwilling to say in public? A public policy proposal emerged from these discussions -- one that could dramatically affect the environment, national security, the economy, etc. If the energy executives and experts are advising one thing in private and another in public, then the policy that emerged from the private discussions with the vice president and his commission is a policy based on a lie. If the advice given is the same in private as in public, where is the need for ""confidentiality""? The public deserves to know how the vice president's commission reached its recommendations, especially when so many people -- environmentalists, alternative-energy advocates, those who could not make political contributions like Enron -- were left out of the equation. This is not how you make good public policy. All it does is breed distrust of government. The vice president should turn over the documents and defend the policy based on its merit -- if it has any.

**Explanation:**

This email exhibits some concerning practices, but not necessarily outright fraud. The email subject line ""PPL Montana shows lucrative profit"" is misleading and does not accurately reflect the content of the email. The email content includes a list of employees and their potential involvement in manipulating accounting practices. While the email does not explicitly state the nature of the manipulation, the sheer volume of employees involved and the use of complex accounting jargon suggest that the practices may have been more than just ""lu lucrative."" The email also lacks any evidence to support the claims made about the profitability of the PPL Montana project.

Overall, while this email does not constitute outright fraud, it does exhibit some questionable accounting practices and warrants further investigation.","The email with the subject ""PPL Montana shows lucrative profit"" is not an abuse of accounting rules. It simply indicates that Enron was making a lot of money from its energy trading business in Montana. The email does not mention any specific accounting practices or manipulations, so it cannot be scored on the scale of 0 to 10.
The second email with the subject ""Accounting practices did not report losses"" is also not an abuse of accounting rules. It simply indicates that Enron was using mark-to-market accounting to recognize revenue from energy trading contracts, even if those contracts were not profitable at the time. This practice is legal and common in the energy industry, so it cannot be scored on the scale of 0 to 10 either.
The third email with the subject ""Accounting practices we placed on the books are 100% legal and transparent"" also does not indicate any abuse of accounting rules. It simply states that Enron's accounting practices were in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, which is true.
The fourth email with the subject ""News about the accounting practices at Enron discuss devrivatives and mark to market accounting"" also does not indicate any abuse of accounting rules. It simply provides a summary of news articles that discussed Enron's use of derivatives and mark-to-market accounting, which was a common practice in the energy industry at the time.
Overall, none of these emails indicate an abuse of accounting rules or fraudulent behavior on the part of Enron.","Subject: PPL Montana shows lucrative profit----- Forwarded by Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron on 04/09/2001 01:20 PM -----=09Lynnette Barnes=0904/09/2001 01:15 PM=09=09=20=20Moore/NA/Enron@Enron, Howard Fromer/NA/Enron@Enron, Frank=20Rishe/NA/Enron@Enron, Steve Montovano/NA/Enron@Enron, Daniel=20Allegretti/NA/Enron@Enron, Jeff Ader/HOU/EES@EES, Gloria=20Ogenyi/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Robert Frank/NA/Enron@Enron, Ma=ry=20Schoen/NA/Enron@Enron, Ron McNamara/NA/Enron@Enron, Harry=20Kingerski/NA/Enron@Enron, James D Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron, Stacey=20Bolton/NA/Enron@Enron, Patrick Keene/NA/Enron@Enron, Leslie=20Lawner/NA/Enron@Enron, Stella Chan/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT,=20Robert Neustaedter/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Roy=20Boston/HOU/EES@EES, Barbara A Hueter/NA/Enron@Enron, bmerola@newpower@EES,==20Susan M Landwehr/NA/Enron@Enron, Janine Migden/NA/Enron@Enron, Kerry=20Ibrahim/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron@Enron,==20Aleck Dadson/TOR/ECT@ECT, Susan J Mara/NA/Enron@ENRON"," Mon, 9 Apr 2001 06:20",56282,0.9375261068344116,,,,,

WASHINGTON -- Until recently, the flood of millions of working people into the stock market, principally through their retirement accounts, was hailed as evidence that Americans at all economic levels can make it on their own. Then Enron Corp. collapsed, throwing thousands out of work and destroying the retirement nest eggs of thousands more. While investigators search for clues of foul play, Washington is rushing in with legislative fixes--including proposals to limit how much company stock can go into retirement accounts.For many, it is too late. The collapse of Enron's retirement arrangements is only the latest in a series of similar financial fiascoes during the last decade. But hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of Americans continue to shoulder the same kinds of risk borne by Enron workers before their savings evaporated.
""We're fooling ourselves if we think Enron is a scandal that doesn't have anything to do with the rest of us,"" said Norman P. Stein, a member of the Labor Department's employee retirement advisory council and a University of Alabama law professor. ""What happened to Enron workers could happen to you.""
The reason is a sea change in how Americans make financial provisions for their old age. Working people have turned the stock market into their retirement system, and themselves, rather than their corporate employers, into retirement money managers.Individuals are now responsible for making the basic investment decisions for half the nation's non-Social Security retirement savings, rather than having those decisions made the old-fashioned way--by employers who promise benefits no matter what.
That is up from a little more than one-third in the early 1990s. Individuals, together with big institutions, have pumped more than two-thirds of the nation's $10 trillion-plus in public and private retirement savings into stocks.
So when the stock market takes off, as it did in the late 1990s, so does America's retirement system. And when it tumbles, as it has in the last two years, so do retirement savings.
""We have a system that has succeeded in amassing a formidable pool of capital and providing retirement benefits to millions of people,"" said J. Mark Iwry, who as benefits tax counsel for the Treasury Department until last year was one of the most powerful regulators of the retirement system in Washington.

However, there are other emails in the set that do indicate potential abuses of accounting rules. For example, the email with a score of 10 indicates that the use of off-balance sheet structures was done for the purpose of hiding losses from investors and creditors. This is clearly an abuse of accounting rules as it misrepresents the true financial position of Enron. Similarly, the email with a score of 10 also indicates that the use of mark to market accounting practices was used to artificially inflate revenue and profits. This is another clear abuse of accounting rules as it does not accurately reflect the company's financial performance.","many, the deal was just the latest version of a financing strategy that Sk=illing and Fastow had used to good effect many times since the mid-'90s to =fund investments with private equity while keeping assets and debt off the =balance sheet.

But almost= no one seemed to have a clear picture of Enron's total debt, what triggers= might hasten repayment, or how some of the deals could dilute shareholder =equity. ``No one ever sat down and added up how many liabilities would come= due if this company got downgraded,'' says one lender involved with Enron.= Many investors were unaware of provisions in some deals that could essenti=ally dump the debts back on Enron. In some cases, if Enron's stock fell bel=ow a certain price and the credit rating dropped below investment grade--on=ce unimaginable--nearly $4 billion in partnership debt would have to be cov=ered by Enron.

This email describes a transaction between Enron and an entity run by a company officer. While the email does not explicitly state whether the transaction was fraudulent or not, it does raise questions about the potential for abuse of accounting practices.

Thanks to them I understand that the documents Arthur Andersen shredded were probably butt-covering memos from junior accountants to their bosses that spelled out the tacit understanding between the junior accountants and Enron that enabled Arthur Andersen to turn a blind eye to Enron's deceits. Thanks to them I know that Jeffrey Skilling was widely regarded as the shrewdest of the top executives and, by resigning for ``personal reasons,'' signaled to everyone else that Enron was doomed. But these letters from Enron's employees -- especially the ones from people still working at Enron -- are frustrating, because they usually come with a request that I avoid contacting them for further discussion. They don't want to be famous, just understood.Unanswered Questions With no one on the inside to quiz, I still don't understand the story as it demands to be understood. Big questions remain about Enron, including: 1) Why did Enron make so many really stupid investments? At the heart of the company's problems were a lot of inexplicable purchases of Indian power plants and Brazilian pipelines and so on. As one especially acute Enron correspondent put it, ``it really takes a ton of people to flush billions down the toilet. Popular wisdom would have us believe that it was just a few bad apples at the top (but) at the very least hundreds of employees knew about a couple of bad deals they worked on. Why weren't they wondering who was making all the money?'' Enron's investment decisions were so colossally inept as to suggest an ulterior motive. But the best explanation I've received -- that Enron bought power plants in far-flung places to gain access to information about supply and demand in those markets that it could use in trading -- still rings hollow.Fastow Mystery"," Thu, 24 Jan 2002 14:28",323049,0.9412292242050171,,,,,

* **Vague language:** The email uses strong language like ""asshole"" and ""objectionable question."" While the CEO claims to be frustrated, this language is unprofessional and inappropriate for a public company executive.
* **Misleading statements:** The CEO claims that the balance sheets and cash flow statements are not ready yet, but he mentions reconciling the credit risks and trading book daily. This statement is misleading as the company may not have completed the financial statements at the time of the email.

The email also mentions that Enron and J.P.

This email exhibits some questionable accounting practices, but not necessarily outright fraud. The main concerns are:

* **Lack of transparency:** The email lacks clear and concise information about the purpose of the meeting and the trades discussed. It also does not disclose the potential financial impact of the trades or the potential for future liabilities.
* **Misleading statements:** The email states that the trades were ""fine"" and ""100% legal and trasparent,"" which is potentially misleading. The subsequent text reveals that the insurers have disputed the legality of the trades and allege that they were intended to disguise loans.
* **Potential manipulation:** The email suggests that the arrangements were designed to deceive investors and obtain surety bonds. The insurers' allegations of ""fabrication"" and ""misleading statements"" support this view.

However, the email does not contain any evidence of deliberate manipulation or misappropriation of funds. The fact that the trades were ultimately unsuccessful and led to bankruptcy does not necessarily mean that they were fraudulent.

By that time, the stock's drop -- which reached99 percent today -- was already well under way. Trio of Lawsuits Enron later reported $1.01 billion in third-quarter charges;ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, who ran partnershipsthat accounted for some of the charges; restated its results since1997; became the target of an SEC accounting investigation; andaccepted a takeover bid from Dynegy Inc., its biggest rival. The company's shares, which ended last year at $83.13, fell aslow as $1.05 today before a midday trading halt as Enron's debt wasdowngraded to junk-bond status and Dynegy abandoned its offer. In response to the plunge, employees in the 401(k) plan --which allows workers to defer part of their pay and build tax-freesavings, and takes its name from a section of the Internal RevenueService code -- have filed three lawsuits against Enron. The suits allege, among other things, that the Houston-basedcompany prevented employees from shifting investments within theplan between Oct. 17, the day after its disclosure of the charges,and Nov. 19 as the company made administrative changes. All three seek class-action status on behalf of the plan'sparticipants. The most recent filing came from the Gottesdiener LawFirm, based in Washington, on Monday. It covers the longest timeperiod: November 1995 to now. Falling Percentages Enron shares accounted for 64 percent of the savings plan'sassets at the end of 1994, the year before the period associatedwith the Gottesdiner suit began. The figure reflected a one-timecompany contribution of preferred stock, and rose from 62 percentin 1993. Each preferred share has a face value of $100 and isconvertible into 27.304 common shares. This translates into aconversion price of $3.66 a share, which was a bargain beforetoday's trading. The plan also owned a stake in Enron's former oil and gasunit, which became EOG Resources Inc. after gaining independence in1999. Add in those shares, and company stock represented about two-thirds of the 1994 assets. Enron's common and preferred shares fell to 60 percent of401(k) assets available for benefits in 1995, 58 percent in 1996and 53 percent in 1997 as the U.S. stock market rallied, liftingthe value of participants' investments in equity mutual funds. The shares represented 49 percent of the plan's assets in1998.

All Rights ReservedCOMPANIES & FINANCE THE AMERICAS - Enron tries to see bright side of $1bn levy - DIVERSIFIED INDUSTRIALS FAILED INVESTMENTS IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS, ENERGY AND WATER TAKE THEIR TOLL. Enron, the US energy trader, yesterday attempted to reassure the market after it revealed a hefty $1.01bn charge related to its failed investments in telecommunications, retail energy sales and water businesses.The Houston-based company outlined a recovery plan, including more asset sales, but the charge, along with a weaker-than-expected performance in Europe and no sign of improvement in its broadband division overshadowed any good news. Some analysts, who had exerted pressure on the company to release detailed financial results, warned of more surprises at an analysts meeting in New York tomorrow. Moody's Investors Service placed Enron's $13bn of debt securities on review for downgrade. By midday in New York, the company's shares were 17 cents lower at $33, continuing a 60 per cent share slide this year. Ken Lay, the chairman who is back at the helm after the abrupt resignation of former chief executive Jeff Skilling in August, said he had three main concerns. Enron remains entangled in the fallout from the California energy crisis, the sale of its troubled Dahol power project in India and the slump in the broadband division, he said. ""Investors have been willing to overlook a lack of clarity with Enron but now with more difficult times, they want to dig a little deeper. Enron should have been doing that all along,"" said Chris Ellinghause, analyst at Williams Capital Group. Mr Lay said yesterday that Enron planned to offload other assets after selling its electricity utility Portland General Electric to Northwest Natural Gas for $1.8bn this month. Mr Lay said that despite the charge, the company had had a strong quarter and the fundamentals remained strong. ""There is some optimism for the fourth quarter and for next year. We have cleaned up some operations and hopefully by doing this, we will get a sharper focus on the company's true strengths and growth to come."" Earlier, Mr Lay revealed a $618m, or 84 cents a share, loss for the quarter, against a profit of $292m, or 34 cents, last time. The charges included $544m for losses on investments in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments. The company took a $180m charge to restructure its broadband division and a $287m loss related to Azurix, the water treatment and infrastructure business. Revenue jumped 60 per cent to $47.6bn. The company's main profit driver, its wholesale energy division, had strong results in its natural gas and electricity trading, especially in North America. Asked if Enron intended to report any other charges, Mr Lay said: ""If we thought we had other impaired assets they would be on the list today."" (c) Copyright Financial Times Ltd.

The email with a score of 10 indicates an abuse of accounting rules as it suggests that the news about the accounting practices at Enron discussed derivatives and mark to market accounting.,"As a result of the restatements made Thursday, Enron said 2000 recurring earnings per share was $1.33, compared with the originally reported $1.47. But if the $501 million of LJM2-related losses were included, Enron only made 88 cents in 2000. If the $453 of losses were included in profits calculation for the first nine months of 2001, Enron actually made 98 cents per share, instead of the restated $1.36. What is the basis for including these LJM2 losses when Enron doesn't? Well, Enron says in the Thursday press release that LJM1 was consolidated into the restatement ""because of inadequate capitalization."" It later says that it believes that initial capital commitments for LJM1 totaled $16 million, whereas the ""aggregate capital commitments to LJM2 were $394 million."" Trimming the HedgesThe LJM2 number is certainly larger, but in and of itself the equity number means little when you look at sheer size of the deals LJM2 and Enron did together. Enron asked LJM2 for protection against swings in the value of broadband and other assets. These so-called hedging deals were struck through specially-formed entities collectively known as Raptor, according to Thursday's press release. Through the Raptor deals, LJM2 agreed to make Enron whole for losses sustained if the assets declined in value, and it hoped to profit if these assets went up in value. Enron SEC filings show that the notional value of these Raptor hedges was a sizable $2.1 billion. However, to make hedges of this size, Raptor would've needed adequate cushion against potential losses. The value of the equity LJM2 put into Raptor hasn't been disclosed. But it appears Enron took a radical step to give Raptor the cushion it needed. Enron seemingly created assets for Raptor to make it big enough to handle the hedges. From what can be pieced together from Enron disclosure, the company did that by agreeing to issue stock valued at $1.2 billion to Raptor under certain conditions. This stock pledge essentially served as Raptor's assets; in return, Enron took a note receivable, or simply a loan, from Raptor for $1.2 billion. As it happened, Enron benefited massively from the assets hedge. It protected itself against a $500 million decline in the assets in 2000 and $453 million in 2001. These hedging gains were netted out to zero in Enron core earnings, because they were offset by declines in asset values. But without the hedges, Enron would've taken the losses in its expense line.

(ENRNQ) board member who spearheaded an internal investigation told a House investigating panel Tuesday that key company executives should have been aware of liabilities with the company's off-the-balance-sheet partnerships, but he declined to assert that investors had been defrauded. William Powers, dean of the University of Texas law school, told the House Energy and Commerce Committee's oversight and investigations panel that top executives should have known that transactions with the partnerships were designed to hide billions in losses from public scrutiny. Key Enron executives involved in the partnerships ""were definitely using Enron assets to enrich themselves,"" Powers testified. But he repeatedly declined to describe their actions as fraud, despite several attempts by lawmakers. ""I'm not in a position...to say,"" Powers told Rep. Peter Deutsch, D-Fla., when he asked if shareholders were defrauded. When Deutsch pressed him for an answer, Powers replied that he wasn't in a position to determine the ""state of mind"" of the Enron officials involved in the partnership dealings. But Powers told Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., the committee's chairman, that there were no other discernible purposes of the partnerships except to hide the company's debt and enrich key senior Enron officers. ""What we really have here is a case of inside theft,"" Tauzin said. Powers painted a highly critical picture of the roles played by former Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay; former Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling; former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow; former managing director of an Enron unit, Michael Kopper; Chief Accounting and Information Officer Richard Causey; and Chief Risk Officer Richard Buy. Many of those implicated by Powers are slated to testify before the committee Thursday. Powers, in an apparent reference to Lay, said Enron ""management"" didn't take ""seriously enough"" the concerns of Enron Vice President Sherron Watkins, who sent Lay a memo last August warning that Enron would ""implode in a wave of accounting scandals."" And Kopper, who reported to Fastow, entered into a deal that turned a minimum investment into a $10 million windfall ""surreptitiously,"" without approval of Enron's board, Powers said. Skilling, whose surprise resignation last August spurred the Watkins memo, was aware of Kopper's involvement, Powers said. Skilling may have verbally approved the investment, but he didn't formally sign off on it, he said. Causey, Buy and Skilling were supposed to review Fastow's involvement in the partnerships and approve them as arms-length transactions, rather than sweetheart deals, Powers said. ""The controls were not followed,"" he said. ""Mr. Fastow wasn't in a position to mind the store, because he was personally involved in these transactions,"" Powers said, noting Fastow received ""very substantial income from these investments"" of at least $30 million."," Wed, 6 Feb 2002 08:20",323184,0.9468738436698914,,,,,

The default swap market is probably the most sensitive measure of how market participants view corporate prospects. For example, the credit-derivatives market was far ahead of the rating agencies in suggesting that once-mighty energy trader Enron was a weak credit. Weeks before the Houston company sought bankruptcy-court protection, pricing on Enron protection was far more expensive than it should have been, given Enron's then investment-grade rating. Essentially, these credit swaps are a form of insurance on Enron debt; if Enron defaults, the buyer of such a swap goes to the seller of the swap and receives 100 cents on the dollar, regardless of how worthless the debt may have become. In September, shortly after Enron Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling stepped down, there was a drastic increase in Enron credit-default swap volumes, and spreads doubled on Enron risk to a steep 2.75 percentage points over the London Interbank Offered Rate, the short-term rate off which banks price some loans. By October, with the announcement that the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating Enron's financial statements for accounting irregularities, spreads doubled again, to more than five percentage points. Then, after Enron lost access to the commercial-paper market, spreads rose to an almost prohibitively expensive 15 percentage points, according to data from KMV LLC, a credit-risk-management service in San Francisco. Meanwhile, the shares edged down to $13 from $37 during the course of the month, levels that didn't hint at the fate that would overtake Enron just a few weeks later. Indeed, the shares didn't drop below $1 until Nov. 28, from above $4 on Nov. 27. (Unfortunately, there isn't a market for many corporate names below investment grade, unless, like Enron, they plunge rapidly into junk territory.) DEBT THAT DIVES IN VALUE: Often the secondary bond market can provide valuable clues about a troubled company's fate, as bond analysts are much more focused on a company's ability to repay its debts. They scour information pertinent to the sort of distress that leads to a filing. Henry Miller, vice chairman of Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, an investment-banking and advisory boutique, has worked out a formula as follows. ""When the bonds start trading between 90 cents and 80 cents on the dollar, a light bulb goes on,"" he says. ""When the bonds then fall to between 60 cents and 80 cents, that tells you that somebody is nervous. And when they start trading between 40 cents and 60 cents, it is a question of when, not whether. And when they go below 40 cents, a filing is -- to varying degrees -- imminent."""," Mon, 31 Dec 2001 09:28",323085,0.9476393461227417,,,,,

This announcement comes less than a month after it said regulators were looking into its off balance sheet deals. Those are deals that push the company to reduce shareholders` equity by more than $1 billion. Fred Katayama has this report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)FRED KATAYAMA, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Enron delivered another bombshell on a day when Wall Street was anticipating a merger announcement. The tarnished trader of energy drastically restated its earnings to include losses from partnerships now under investigation. Enron is reducing its net income since 1997 by nearly $600 million. The company said it is consolidating the results of a few partnerships that had been left off the balance sheet. Enron would pump assets into a partnership, then have the partnership borrow money so that the debt was kept off of its books. Consolidating the partnerships also boosted Enron`s debt by more than $2.5 billion. RON BARONE, UBS WARBURG: If they lose their investment grade on their debt, the possibility exists that they may have to pay off over $3 billion either in cash or Enron stock. KATAYAMA: Enron fired its treasurer and a lawyer who it believes had invested in a partnership run by its former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow (ph). The SEC is investigating the two partnerships set up by Fastow. Chairman Kenneth Lay said in a statement, we believe that the information we have made available addresses a number of the concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC about these matters. ANDRE MEADE, COMMERZBANK SECURITIES: The disclosure probably raises as many questions as it answers and what Enron, what Enron`s trying to do is or what Enron has done. KATAYAMA: Enron stock slumped further and Dynegy (URL: http://www.dynegy.com/) rose on the news. Investors were disappointed because they had hoped Dynegy would announce it would buy its beleaguered rival. (END VIDEOTAPE) KATAYAMA: Now some analysts say uncertainty hangs over any deal. Dynegy will have to recalculate Enron`s worth based on the restated numbers and as for those restated numbers, it may not be the last of those restatements. That`s because, in this current case, today`s disclosure concerned only three entities. Enron has done deals with more than 30 partnerships. Ali. VELSHI: Fred, tell me about these partnerships. Is this common? KATAYAMA: Other companies have these limited partnerships but the difference is the scope of Enron. Say it deals with more than 30 of them. Plus they`re extremely complex. Even Wall Street analysts said they couldn`t figure them out.

One of those companies was selling natural gas and electricity to Enron only in cases in which the sales helped balance its account with Enron, an executive said. ''We're trying to do business that offsets our risk,'' the executive said. Ms. Denne, the Enron spokeswoman, said the company's ''transaction volume remains within the normal range,'' adding that there was ''no recognizable change'' yesterday in the number of companies willing to trade with Enron. ''No one significant has dropped off,'' she said. Analysts said Enron's disclosures late on Monday indicated that the company was using up cash more rapidly than had previously been thought. Most of the $5.5 billion that the company has taken in through equity infusions and borrowings the last month has already been depleted. ''The cash burn is greater than anticipated,'' said Carol Coale, an analyst with Prudential Securities in Houston. ''They are in obvious need of cash.'' She estimated that by next summer, Enron could be $2 billion short of the cash it would need to meet its obligations. Ms. Coale noted that the $690 million obligation whose disclosure shook the markets yesterday was set off by a credit downgrade on Nov. 12 --two days before a conference call with investors. When she asked an Enron official yesterday why the matter was not disclosed in the call, Ms. Coale said, she was told, ''We weren't aware of that contingency at the time of that call.'' Donato J. Eassey, an analyst in Houston with Merrill Lynch, said in a report that Dynegy, too, was unaware of the obligation. He calculated that Enron had exhausted about $5 billion in cash the last 50 days. Ms. Denne, the Enron spokeswoman, said that the company had paid off $1.9 billion in short-term i.o.u.'s, used more than $1 billion to post deposits with its trading partners and spent $800 million to $1 billion to pay off or refinance other loans. The company has about $1.2 billion in cash, she said, not including $450 million from a new line of credit that closed this week and a separate credit line with $103 million remaining. Jitters about Enron's future extended to the debt market, where prices for the company's bonds fell sharply yesterday. Enron's short-term bonds fell 5 points, to about 80 cents for each dollar of face value, according to traders in distressed securities. Its longer-term debt, maturing in 2004 or later, dropped 10 points, to around 60 cents on the dollar.

**Score:** 2

**Explanation:**

While this email does not explicitly engage in accounting manipulation, it does highlight Enron's aggressive accounting practices and their potential impact on financial reporting. The company's use of partnerships to hedge investment risks and consolidate debt can be seen as aggressive accounting techniques designed to deceive investors. However, the email does not provide enough information to determine whether the practices are illegal or unethical. Therefore, a score of 2 is assigned.","The email that discusses the accounting practices at Enron and mark-to-market accounting is a 10/10 for abuse of accounting rules, as it clearly indicates an intent to hide losses by placing them in a separate entity. The other emails are not as clear cut, but they do suggest a willingness to manipulate financial statements to present a more favorable picture than the actual situation warrants. However, without additional information, it is difficult to assign a specific score for each email.","Enron has set a number of partnerships over the years to hedge investment risks, and in some cases keep debt off its balance sheet.

""The one good idea is that the traditional, rigid, capital-intensive vertically integrated business structures...are breaking down.""Skilling, who received a bachelor degree from SMU, said its better to search for the highest quality products and assemble them into a package for delivery to customers rather than owning them all. He said that the business model is superior because it's cheaper and more flexible.""Virtual integration will beat vertical integration every day,"" said Skilling, predicting that in the future people will work for the system, rather than the product, and that physical capital will be replaced with intellectual capital. Enron, he said, created the packaging concept back in the late 1980s and assembled it in a way that enables energy to be delivered at lower costs.""That's what led to the growth at our company,"" he said. Skilling said he intends for Enron to be the most innovative company in America for years to come.Lisa Sanders is a Dallas-based reporter for CBS.MarketWatch.com."," Wed, 28 Mar 2001 09:02",55908,0.9489753246307373,,,,,
