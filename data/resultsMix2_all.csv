**Email End:**

**Score:** 0

**Reasoning:**

This email is simply a discussion about an article about Enron's accounting practices. It does not involve any accounting practices or financial transactions, therefore it does not indicate any abuse of accounting rules.

**Conclusion:**

The email score is 0.","The email that discusses the news about Enron's accounting practices is not an abuse of the accounting rules. It simply provides information on the topic and does not indicate any wrongdoing or fraudulent behavior. The other emails, however, do seem to suggest a potential abuse of the accounting rules.
The email that mentions placing loses in the Raptor SBE could be viewed as an attempt to hide losses from investors and regulators. While this practice may not technically be illegal, it does indicate a lack of transparency and trustworthiness on the part of Enron's management team.
The email that discusses accounting practices that did not report losses so revenue was realized as profit is also concerning. This suggests that Enron may have been using mark-to-market accounting to artificially inflate its financial position, which could be viewed as an attempt to mislead investors and regulators.
Finally, the email that mentions placing on the books are 100% legal and transparent is also concerning. While it is true that Enron's accounting practices were technically legal, they may have been used to conceal losses from investors and regulators. This suggests a lack of transparency and trustworthiness on the part of Enron's management team.
Overall, while none of these emails explicitly indicate fraudulent behavior, they do suggest that Enron's accounting practices may have been used to conceal losses from investors and regulators. This is a serious concern and should be investigated further.","Subject: Re: WSJ Article on Enron's Mark to Market AccountingGreetings Jeff,Thanks.

Dear [Recipient],
I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to bring your attention to a recent Wall Street Journal article that discussed the use of mark-to-market accounting practices by Enron. As you may know, we have been using similar accounting practices in our SBE, Raptors.
While I understand that these practices are 100% legal and transparent, I also recognize that they could be perceived as an attempt to hide losses. Therefore, I believe it is important for us to review our accounting practices and ensure that we are operating with full transparency and integrity.
I have attached a revised memo from Steve Kean that provides additional context on the use of mark-to-market accounting and its relevance to Enron's situation. Please take some time to review it and let me know if you have any questions or concerns.
Best regards,

The email discusses the impact of Japanese accounting changes on derivatives. It mentions that listed Japanese companies will now have to record their holding of marketable property assets and securities at current market value rather than book value, which means that balance sheets will no longer be supported by assets valued at inflated bubble economy levels. The email also notes that the introduction of mark-to-market accounting requires Japanese companies to expose their profit streams to movements in equity markets, as the definition of securities includes cross shareholdings which bind members of Japan's Keiretsu and other business groupings.

The email does not explicitly mention hiding losses or abusing accounting rules. However, it is clear that the new accounting standards will have a significant impact on Japanese companies' balance sheets and profit streams. It is possible that some companies may use derivatives to hedge their equity exposure as they embark on share sale programs.

These changes arecomprehensive and include the introduction of fair value --ormark-to-market--accounting. This last change, although seemingly innocuouswill be particularly powerful in its impact. But What Has All This To Do With Derivatives? The introduction of mark-to-market accounting requires listed Japanesecompanies to record their holding of marketable property assets andsecurities at current market value rather than at book value. This meansthat balance sheets will no longer be buttressed by assets valued atinflated bubble economy levels. But most crucially profit streams willbecome exposed to movements in equity markets, as the definition ofsecurities includes the cross shareholdings which bind members of Japan'sKeiretsu and other business groupings. These are substantial in Japan,accounting for perhaps 40% of all shareholdings. The unwinding of cross shareholdings is undoubtedly one of the factorsbehind the recent weakness of Tokyo stock prices, not least as foreignbuyers who had been soaking up much of the unwound cross held shares comingonto to the market have been notably absent over the past few months. Hence there has been much talk about how best to unwind these crossshareholdings without further depressing the market. Where possible firmswith mutual shareholdings have been seeking arrangements that areeffectively straight swaps. But derivatives can also play their part. Many corporates with large shareholding disposal programmes have beenactively seeking to hedge their equity exposure as they embark on theirshare sale process. Often they have effected this through the use of calloptions. Thus if the market falls they have at least benefited from thepremium earned at the time of the sale of the call option and if the marketrises and the option is called by the purchaser then the shares have beensuccessfully disposed of, but without further dampening an already weakmarket."," Mon, 19 Nov 2001 08:11",,154004,0.8140165209770203,,,,

Our aggressive use of accounting management vehicles, and early sales of positions has significantly reduced our accounting volatility and economic exposure. Hopefully, the following points will address the appropriate issues.Currently we have invested $108 million in 22 companies. Of that, approximately $80 million still has accounting exposure. The other $28 million invested has either been hedged or already written down. Our disciplined use of Fair Value accounting has allowed us to minimize accounting risk by not writing up investments simply because of improving market conditions.Specifically - Avici, Sycamore, and FastForward have generated approximately $180 million in earnings this year. DEN, Salus Media, and IAM.com have combined for $9 million in writeoffs.Recently, I have done a review of our portfolio and I believe our accounting loss exposure for 2001 is limited. Over 80% of our portfolio companies have raised enough capital to sustain them through all of 2001. So, if the markets (private and public) are closed, I do not believe these companies will risk bankruptcy during 2001. Also, our discipline of only co-investing with big partners helps assure these companies will continue to get funding.Going forward, we are making certain revisions to our strategy to take compensate for, and take advantage of, the weak markets.Limiting venture investments to technology companies that we have a competitive advantage in assessing the technology risk. Also, moving our venture effort earlier stage to take more technology risk and less market risk.We are beginning to look at other types of private equity investments. There are many public companies, whose stock prices are at 10% or less of their highs. I still believe that the fundamentals of the industries indicate that the vast majority of these companies will go bankrupt. However, there will be a select few that will survive and will end up with reduced competition and big markets. These companies will be big winners. We are carefully looking for these. I will keep you informed as this develops.If you have any other questions, please let me know.Thanks,Kevin Garland"," Sun, 3 Dec 2000 15:01",,443255,0.8237040042877197,,,,

Finally, the email with a score of 0 does not indicate any abuse of accounting rules as it simply discusses the use of mark to market accounting practices and their legal status.","Investors are asking hard questions, and not always getting the answers they want. Using mark-to-market methods, a company calculates the fair market value of a commodity position - whether it's a contract, an option, a swap, etc. - at the time, even if the value of the position is realized over a longer period. The problem with this method is the actual cash a company realizes from the position might not be the same value the company calculated in its original assessment. Also, sometimes it isn't easy to calculate the fair value of the commodity position. This is particularly true in instances where the market for the commodity isn't liquid. Over time, companies with the highest level of disclosure regarding their mark-to-market gains will most likely trade at higher multiples to counterparts that provide little or no disclosure, said ABN AMRO Inc. analyst Paul Patterson. Encouragingly, it appears companies may already be responding to the call for added disclosure. According to a survey Patterson conducted, more companies with energy trading units were willing to disclose the details of their mark-to-market accounting practices during third-quarter conference calls compared with those in the second quarter. Patterson said he prefers earnings that are cash-based. ""All things being equal, we believe reported earnings that more closely reflect the timely realization of cash have a higher quality associated with them than earnings that do not,"" he said. He expects investors to become smarter and learn to distinguish between earnings growth through accrual accounting and growth fueled by mark-to-market accounting. At the end of the day, it is not a matter of simply producing profits, but being able to say where those earnings came from, said one investor, who manages a pension fund. Some investors also may be placing a greater emphasis on the cash flow the energy merchants produce. Tim O'Brien, portfolio manager of the Gabelli Utilities Fund, said energy merchants that own the physical power assets to back up their trading positions should trade at a premium to an independent power producers and traditional utility companies. Still, the stocks should be valued at less than the growth rate of the company because of their heavy exposures to commodity prices. Energy merchants include companies such as Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) and Dominion Resources Inc. (D). According to O'Brien, the group never deserved to have the price-to-earnings multiples above 20- to 30-times earnings, which were once paid for the stocks. ""We all got sucked up by the up-leg of the cycle and forgot just how cyclical these companies are,"" O'Brien said, adding that the average multiple should be in the high single-digits to the high-teens."," Mon, 26 Nov 2001 14:12",,5624,0.8491188883781433,,,,

This email exhibits some questionable accounting practices, but not necessarily outright fraud. The main issue is the use of mark-to-market accounting to inflate profits, which is a violation of traditional accounting principles. However, the email does not provide enough information to determine the severity of the abuse.

**Here's a breakdown of the email:**

* **Positive aspects:**
    * The email mentions the use of mark-to-market accounting, which can be a legitimate accounting technique.
    * It also mentions the potential for overstatement of profits, which could be seen as a red flag.
* **Negative aspects:**
    * The email lacks specific details about the assumptions made in calculating profits.
    * It does not provide any evidence to support the claim that the assumptions were unreliable.
    * The email does not discuss the potential impact of the accounting practices on investors or stakeholders.

The email discusses Enron's use of mark-to-market accounting and its implications. The sender mentions that there were suggestions for additional disclosures regarding the accounting practices, particularly in long-term transactions. They also mention that the accounting rule allowed companies to use their own models to estimate fair value, which was then treated as the market value. Enron used this technique to report profits in some of its businesses. The sender notes that many of the contracts covered companies in states that had not yet deregulated their power markets, and Enron would forecast when the states would deregulate and project what prices would be under the currently nonexistent deregulated market. Based on its projections, Enron would calculate its total profit over the life of the contract and book the profit immediately, after discounting that figure to account for the risk of default by the customer and the fact that most payments would not be received for years. The sender also mentions that Arthur Andersen, Enron's auditor, took several issues related to Enron's accounting to the task force.

""There certainly might be great volatility that could cause what now looks like a winning, locked-in gain to not arise sometime in the future."" The companies reject any suggestion that there may be quality problems with their earnings. But at the heart of the situation is an accounting technique that allows companies to include as current earnings those profits they expect to realize from energy-related contracts and other derivative instruments in future periods, sometimes stretching over more than 20 years. So-called mark-to-market accounting is mandated by accounting-rule makers when companies have outstanding energy-related contracts on their books at the end of a quarter, such as agreements to sell electricity or buy natural gas over a period of time at certain prices. Under those rules, companies estimate the fair market values of those contracts on their balance sheets each quarter as assets or liabilities. Changes in the value of a contract from quarter to quarter then are either added to or subtracted from net earnings. If, for instance, the market price for natural gas rises above the price specified in a company's contract to buy gas, generally the company will record an unrealized gain. That gain is recognized as income and recorded as an asset on the company's balance sheet. At the end of each quarter, the contract is revalued. The value of the previously recorded asset is increased, and any increase in unrealized gain is recorded as additional income. Conversely, if the market value for gas falls, and the value of the contract has declined, any change in the contract's value is recorded on the company's balance sheet, and a loss is recorded on its income statement. e Yet in their financial reports, the companies only vaguely describe the methods they use to come up with fair-value estimates on the contracts. Increasingly, quoted market prices offering independent guidance are becoming readily available for several years into the future. However, with some long-term derivative instruments, particularly electricity contracts, future market prices don't extend far enough to cover the full life of those contracts.

This email exhibits some questionable accounting practices and displays a culture of excessive self-interest and greed.

But investors counting on these gains could be in for a jolt down the road. Shares of these companies have been on a tear lately. And some of the biggest players are in Houston, the center of the energy-trading industry. Dynegy Inc.'s stock is up more than fourfold so far this year at $53.438, and now trades for 41 times what analysts project the company's 2000 earnings will be, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. Shares of Enron Corp., the largest trader of gas and electricity in North America, have nearly doubled this year to $84.875, or 60 times earnings. Meanwhile, El Paso Energy Corp.'s stock has jumped 61% this year to $62.375, or 24 times earnings.Traders at these and other companies are capitalizing on the wild price swings and supply fluctuations that have accompanied deregulation in some regional markets. Natural-gas prices have more than doubled in the past year, while supplies have tightened. And the rapid price fluctuations for electricity have prompted many large businesses to seek price protection through hedging or fixed-price contracts, generating large premiums for traders. But what many investors may not realize is that much of these companies' recent profits constitute unrealized, noncash gains. Frequently, these profits depend on assumptions and estimates about future market factors, the details of which the companies do not provide, and which time may prove wrong. And because of minimal disclosure standards in these kinds of cases, it's difficult for investors to assess whose assumptions might be too aggressive, or what market changes might invalidate the assumptions -- and force earnings revisions."," Mon, 25 Sep 2000 03:08",>> ,114797,0.9458684921264648,>>  Lorna Brennan on 09/22/2000 09,>> ,,>>

The new rule requires that any change in the value of the derivative be""booked""--included as a gain or loss in determining the company's income forfinancial accounting purposes--even if the company has not disposed of thederivative.The result, Price said, is to create increased volatility in the company'sdetermination of income and loss for accounting purposes. Wheeler said thatcompanies do not want this increased volatility to apply to theirdeterminations of income for tax purposes.Price said the accounting profession adopted new standards for derivativesbecause of numerous problems, including:* incomplete reporting, in that some companies reported no informationor reported information only in a footnote;* inconsistent reporting, in that companies used different rules fordetermining cost and value;* difficulty in applying the accounting rules; and* lack of transparency, in that companies took different approaches intheir treatment of derivatives,meaning income was not determined under the same rules andinformation on financial statements could not be compared with reliability.Issues for Congress to StudyBuckley said the mark-to-market approach is slowly beingadopted in the tax system. He said it was not something he favored acrossthe board but in his view it made sense for the tax system to apply themark-to-market approach to derivatives. He said the problems identified byPrice in accounting for derivatives also applied to the tax system--there isuncertainty and inconsistency.Buckley also said it would simplify recordkeeping to conformthe tax system to the accounting approach, and he favored Congress lookingat this question. He said that Congress's adoption of the mark-to-marketapproach for securities in the early 1990s was the right approach, and hethought that the Financial Accounting Standards Board had taken an""interesting and important step"" in adopting FAS 133.Buckley said he sees the problem of defining a derivative asa major issue for the tax law, and questioned whether the accountingdefinition was ""workable.""

This email discusses an accounting error at Enron and the potential impact on its financial statements. While the email acknowledges the error and the subsequent correction, it does not provide sufficient evidence to determine whether the accounting practices employed by Enron were abusive or not. The email primarily focuses on the similarities between Enron's accounting error and other high-profile accounting debacles, rather than the specific accounting rules that were violated. Therefore, it is not possible to assess the abuse of accounting rules based solely on this email.","The email with score 10 indicates outright fraud, while the email with score 0 indicates no abuse of accounting rules. The other two emails indicate a possible abuse of accounting rules but not necessarily fraud.","""It is basic accounting that you don't record equity until you get cash, and a note doesn't count as cash,"" says Lynn Turner, a former chief accountant for the SEC. ""The question that raises is: How did both partners and the manager on this audit miss this simple Accounting 101 rule?"" Adds Douglas Carmichael, an accounting professor at Baruch College in New York: ""Anyone that's an accountant looking at the entry should have known"" it violated GAAP. An Enron spokesman, Vance Meyer, says, ""The accounting error was just that -- an error,"" explaining that, ""We believed it was not material. However, it was, of course, corrected . . . And we did make the correction with Andersen's concurrence."" He says Andersen ""performed limited quarterly reviews"" of the company's unaudited financial statements and reviewed the entries that resulted in the shareholder-equity overstatements ""to the extent they deemed necessary."" To some who follow the accounting world closely, this has a familiar ring to it. During the past few years, every Big Five auditor has been hit by multiple accounting debacles at high-profile clients. For Andersen, Enron joins a list including Waste Management Inc. and Sunbeam Corp. While the names of the clients may change, the issues remain largely the same. For instance, Enron had reported net income of $105 million for 1997, a figure that Enron last week said will be reduced to $9 million in its upcoming restatement for that year. Enron said the reduction is mostly because of $51 million in various unexplained ""audit adjustments and reclassifications"" that its auditors had proposed in 1997 but at the time had determined to be ""immaterial."" Cumulatively, those immaterial adjustments added up to nearly half of Enron's net income for 1997 and now will be included in the company's restatements. That looks a lot like what happened at Sunbeam. According to the SEC's May settlement order with Sunbeam, Andersen auditors had routinely dismissed so many violations of GAAP as immaterial that they eventually piled up to produce significant distortions in Sunbeam's financial statements, making the barely solvent consumer-products maker look handsomely profitable. Sunbeam filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court protection this past February. In May, the SEC filed a civil lawsuit against five former Sunbeam executives and the Andersen partner in charge of the company's audit, accusing them of engaging in a massive financial fraud; all six defendants have denied the SEC's allegations. Andersen itself wasn't named as a defendant and has said it believes the lawsuit against its partner was an unjustified action over questions of professional judgment."," Mon, 12 Nov 2001 07:27",,260208,0.9730621576309204,,,,

This email exhibits some questionable accounting practices, but not necessarily outright fraud. Here's the breakdown:

**Positive aspects:**

* **Transparency:** The email mentions the potential for future edits and invites the recipient to participate in the process.
* **Accountability:** The email assigns direct responsibility for accounting to Greg Whiting and outlines clear expectations for monitoring income and cash flow.

**Areas of concern:**

* **Misleading statements:** The email claims that the accounting practices are ""100% legal and trasparent,"" which is potentially misleading. The email does not provide evidence to support this statement.
* **Lack of clarity:** The email does not explicitly state whether the accounting practices are intended to hide losses or not.
* **Potential for manipulation:** The email suggests that the recipient can be pressured into accepting accounting practices that are not in their best interest.

**Overall:**

While this email does not exhibit the hallmarks of outright fraud, it does raise concerns about the potential for misleading and manipulative accounting practices.

**Explanation:**

The email discusses Enron's accounting practices, specifically the use of mark-to-market accounting to hide losses. The email highlights the potential fraud involved in this practice, as it involves evaluating contracts at ""fairvalue"" prices, which can be inflated and unrealized. The email also mentions the potential impact of these practices on Enron's financial position, as they can lead to misleadingly high profits.

However, the email does not provide sufficient evidence to support its claims. For example, it does not provide any documentation or evidence to support the allegations of fraud or manipulation. Additionally, the email does not provide any information about the context in which the accounting practices were used, such as the overall economic climate or Enron's industry position.

Overall, the email provides a well-written analysis of Enron's accounting practices and the potential impact on its financial position. However, it lacks the supporting evidence and context necessary to substantiate its claims.","The email with the subject line ""Bad trading.

Enron's main technique to pump up earnings probably revolvedaround a loose-as-a-goose process for the accounting of energy derivatives.Called mark-to-market, the technique involves evaluating contracts at ""fairvalue"" prices. Since some of these contracts stretched out for 20 years, thefutures market provides no firm prices. And, absent a liquid market withclear prices, ""fair value"" becomes a mug's game in which companies canvastly inflate value. These overstated gains, of course, were also unrealized, noncash gains. InSeptember 2000, Jonathan Weil, a reporter for the Journal, took a look atEnron's second quarter and found that absent noncash earnings, Enron wouldhave had a loss. Mr. Weil later found that for the year as a whole,unrealized trading gains accounted for more than half of the company'soriginally reported pretax profits. Hardly a confidence-builder in thequality of Enron's earnings.When their derivative strategies started to go sour, this theory runs, Enronremoved the contracts from its financial statements and hid them in specialentities created for just that purpose.Bad Assets. Another theory locates Enron's earning problems in their hardassets. Enron had a bunch of huge and underperforming assets, like itsbroadband company, water company and power plants in India and Brazil. Inorder to hustle those assets and associated debts off its financial reports,the company created some limited partnerships to buy these dogs -- eitherwith bank loans or money provided by Enron itself. These partnerships(allegedly) transferred enough control to third parties to get them offEnron's balance sheet. Enron guaranteed these deals with ""make good"" provisions backed by Enronstock -- a promise that Enron would make good any losses in the value of thepartnerships. When the value of the assets tanked, the make-good provisionskicked in, resulting, for example, in the enormous write-down in shareholderequity in November.Depending on which theory one accepts, there are two bottom lines.The first holds that the sagging earnings problem was fatal and that it isentirely possible Enron was in the process of liquidating itself. Jim Chanosof Kynikos Associates hypothesizes that Enron's cost of capital was higherthan its returns on invested capital. A second argues that if Enron'smanagers had been content to accept the fact that in competitive marketstheir ""first mover"" advantage was going to be competed away, and had beenwilling to endure slower earnings growth, it would not be in bankruptcytoday."," Wed, 26 Dec 2001 07:53",,154348,1.0189393758773804,,,,

The email with a score of 0 indicates no abuse of the accounting rules as it states that the accounting practices were legal and transparent.,"The significance of special charges -- whether they represent old baggage from the past or illuminate the future -- is at the center of a lively debate under way in the accounting world. One side holds that generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, provide the best available snapshot of a company's financial position. GAAP, which companies must use in their official financial statements, requires that nearly all charges be treated as ordinary expenses. Others, including many stock analysts, contend the best view comes from ""pro forma"" financial results -- calculated ""as if"" many expenses didn't really exist. The idea is that these expenses aren't relevant to future performance. Companies increasingly highlight the pro forma view in news releases they generally put out before their official filings with regulators. But pro forma calculations adhere to no particular standard. Companies essentially do what they want. Now, accountants and economists say the practice of excluding blemishes is so widespread that companies and analysts often guide investors to dismiss charges that contain prescient warnings -- like the one at Bethlehem Steel. Ms. Applebaum, the Salomon Smith Barney analyst who played down Bethlehem's big write-off, explains that she has covered other steel companies that returned to profitability shortly after writing off deferred tax assets. She thought Bethlehem would do the same. She notes that GAAP rules on such assets obliged Bethlehem to follow strict criteria in assessing its chances of future profitability -- stricter criteria than stock analysts typically use. As for Bethlehem, Chief Financial Officer Leonard M. Anthony says the charge the company took was to some extent ""predictive of the future."" GAAP also has well-established standards for writing down other kinds of assets. Companies must reduce the value on their books of anything from a customer loan to a manufacturing plant when its worth has diminished. Again, Wall Street stock analysts tend to dismiss the resulting charges as one-time events. Sometimes that makes sense. During the 1981-82 recession, restructuring was a part of many corporations' strategies. They took charges for streamlining, outsourcing and otherwise shedding costs to position themselves for recovery. Because the resulting earnings volatility made it hard to compare companies' growth rates or price-earnings ratios, and because the charges weren't expected to recur, there was logic to excluding them to come up with ""smoothed"" earnings trends. ""Investors came to look upon the charges, correctly in many cases, as evidence that those firms had recognized past mistakes and had made tough decisions to become more efficient,"" said a September 2001 study by the Jerome Levy Economics Institute at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y."," Mon, 31 Dec 2001 09:28",,323085,1.0227268934249878,,,,

Whatever happened afterthe draft and invitation to comment were issued in the run-up to Christmas,``Australia will have to make a choice.''Accounting bodies worldwide have been working on standards for financialinstruments to prevent the derivatives -related disasters that rocked manycompanies during the late 1980s and early 1990s, including US companyProcter & Gamble, which lost $US157 million on interest-rate derivatives in1994.The matter has become urgent in Australia partly because the United Stateshas introduced its own standard Financial Accounting Standard Boardstatement No133 which became effective for some companies on July 1, andwhich will operate from January 1 for those whose financial years coincidewith the calendar.FAS 133 is regarded as a nightmare by corporate treasurers in the US andhere, because it requires derivatives and other financial instruments to be``marked to market'' every quarter, rather than accounted for on afair-value basis.Its critics claim it will lead to volatility and confusion in companyfinancial statements.Mr Alfredson said that in the US, ``there is now a special interpretationgroup like the Urgent Issues Group here interpreting 133. In other words, itis so complex, readers can't just read the standard and interpret it. Thegroup has already issued more than 100 interpretations.''Australia has no accounting standard that deals comprehensively with therecognition and measurement of financial instruments, although it has madeprogress with disclosure requirements. Acknowledging the concern over themark-to-market approach, the AASB commissioned the development of afair-value model.The joint working group consists of representatives from Australia, Canada,France, Germany, New Zealand, the Nordic countries, Britain, the US and theInternational Accounting Standards Committee. IASC has incorporated elementsof FAS 133 into its own much-criticised financial instruments standard, IAS39.It remains to be seen how much simpler the fair-value approach will be.``In fair-value accounting, you get the market value for the instruments atthe time and fair value them. It sounds easy in principle, but it is muchmore complicated in practice,'' Mr Alfredson said.Developing the appropriate standard is only half the battle, however; thetrick is to gain widespread acceptance for it. Even if Australia acceptedthe fair-value model, Mr Alfredson said, it would not be able to implementit alone, ``at least if I have any influence''."," Mon, 13 Nov 2000 04:48",,152192,1.0234720706939697,,,,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to express my concern about the accounting practices that we have been using, particularly in regards to the mark to market accounting and the use of SBE like Raptors to hide losses. I believe that these practices could be viewed as fraudulent and may not be entirely legal and transparent.
I would appreciate it if we could discuss this matter during the ""Open Forum"" session at the Global Accounting Leadership Offsite in Galveston, Texas. I am sure that many of my colleagues share similar concerns and it would be great to have an open discussion about it.

Deloitte & Touche's report, which includes an unmodified opinion for the review year ended August 31, 2001, has been accepted by the Peer Review Committee of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' (AICPA) SEC Practice and is available at the AICPA, http://www.aicpa.org/members/div/secps/index.htm . Every three years since 1978, major accounting firms, under the oversight of the Public Oversight Board (POB), have been engaged to conduct reviews of the accounting and auditing practices of member firms in the AICPA SEC Practice Section (SECPS). The scope of this year's peer review of Andersen was expanded after financial reporting issues emerged at Enron Corp. Andersen requested, and Deloitte & Touche had separately concluded, that expanded procedures were appropriate. Deloitte & Touche independently determined the scope of the expanded peer review procedures.In total, the peer and Andersen's internal practice review covered 240 Andersen audit engagements in over 30 Andersen offices and the Andersen national office. The engagements reviewed by Deloitte & Touche reviewers and Andersen practice review teams involved some 45 percent of Andersen's U.S. audit partners. The engagements selected for review represented a cross-section of Andersen's accounting and auditing practice with emphasis on higher-risk engagements. It included examining working paper files and reports and interviewing engagement personnel. Deloitte & Touche's opinion was ""unmodified,"" without qualification. However, three issues not deemed significant enough to affect the opinion were raised in an attached comment letter. Such comments are not unusual in peer review reports. The comments related to: documentation of certain auditing procedures on some engagements; communications with audit committees in some instances; and management representation letters that needed more tailoring in some instances. In its response to Deloitte & Touche's comments, Andersen said it had taken, or would take, the steps recommended to improve its accounting and auditing practices.

This email exhibits some questionable accounting practices, but not necessarily outright fraud. The main concerns are:

* **Misleading statements:** The email claims that the accounting practices are ""100% legal and trasparent,"" which is inaccurate. The use of mark-to-market accounting can be complex and difficult to understand for outsiders, and it can often be used to hide losses.
* **Lack of transparency:** The email does not provide enough information about the specific accounting practices that are being discussed. It would be more transparent to provide a list of the specific accounting practices that are being used, and to explain why they are being used.
* **Potential for bias:** The email does not provide any evidence to support the claim that the accounting practices are non-negotiable. It would be more objective to provide evidence to support this claim, such as quotes from industry experts or legal scholars.

Overall, this email exhibits some questionable accounting practices, but not necessarily outright fraud. The email score of 2 reflects this.","The email with the subject ""Authorized Traders : Montreal & Chicago"" does not indicate any abuse of accounting rules.

This email raises concerns about the potential misappropriation of accounting practices and the lack of transparency in the financial reporting system. While the email acknowledges the potential for bias and the need for an unbiased pursuit of truth, it primarily focuses on the broader issues of the inadequacy of traditional accounting practices in capturing the complexities of the modern economy.

It emphasizes the need for innovative accounting methods that can account for the rapid pace of change and the growing importance of intangible assets.

But we can't stop at Arthur Andersen. The real ""values"" crisis represented by the Enron mess is far deeper, and stretches across our economy. We are all being victimized by it, and the situation is growing ever worse. It is the great unreported business story of our time: the growing failure of the accounting system to accurately capture what is going in the new hyperspeed economy. Simply put, we have no idea what any company is worth today. The accounting industry is mired in a system that was devised 600 years ago and has only been fine-tuned ever since. It doesn't work any more. Accountants know it, corporate executives know it, and the stock market knows it. The general recognition of this fact has led to a widespread ethical sloppiness made manifest in such things as Arthur Andersen's apparent conflict. The reality is that the only time anybody really checks an audit anymore is after a financial disaster like Enron, when scapegoats must be found. Rear-View Mirror Accounting I once likened traditional accounting to driving a car by only looking in the rear view mirror. It can tell you where a company has recently been, but it is unable to tell you where that company is now. And in a world in which change occurs in nanoseconds, such obsolete data is worthless. Today, events arrive so swiftly, and change so constant, that it is no longer even enough to operate in the present. Modern business now runs in the future. The result is a growing gap between traditional ""book"" value and actual market value - and through that gap drives not only companies like Enron, but truly valuable firms like General Electric and Intel. Traditional accounting has long dealt with that gap through a line entry entitled ""goodwill."" But it was typically only added when a company sold for more than the total value of its inventory, buildings, etc. At most, this goodwill only represented a few percent of the total value. That was then. In the modern economy, for great, fast moving, innovative young companies this so-called ""goodwill"" can represent 90 percent of their value. When a corporate audit can only tell us about ten percent of a company, what the hell is the point? There have been a number of efforts in recent years to come up with innovative new ways to determine corporate value, many of them under the all-encompassing terms ""intellectual capital"" or ""intangible assets"". But they are still in their earliest stages, and most slam up against the formidable wall of the traditional accounting industry."," Thu, 24 Jan 2002 14:28",,323049,1.0543407201766968,,,,

* **Content:** The email includes a detailed breakdown of financial transactions associated with the Avista transaction. However, the formatting and organization of the data is poor.
* **Lack of transparency:** The email does not disclose the basis for certain accounting decisions, such as the mark-to-market accounting and the revenue recognition policies. This makes it difficult for outsiders to understand the true financial position of the company.
* **Potential misinterpretation:** The email does not provide enough context or explanation for the financial data. This could lead to misinterpretation and inaccurate conclusions.

Nickoley had an immediateneed to figure out what other buyers existed out in the market to taketheir place, but it took her a day or two to get investor information outof the mainframe-based system she used to manage CP issuance.In October, the kind of capability Nickoley sought finally became availablewith the introduction of Prescient Funding Desk. Now we know for allcustomers what time of day they trade, what size of trade they normally do,if they come in through cpmarket or on the phone, says Nickoley. Thecustomer analytics was the key.With the development of Funding Desk, companies can get information onprices, including fluctuations in competitors? CP rates and what investorsare looking for in the market on a real-time basis. Funding Desk's pricingmodule provides short-term market rates from Prebon Yamane and CP ratesfrom cpmarket.com, Prescient?s online platform for direct issuance of CP.In Tune with MarketThe advantages? Trades done on cpmarket.com flow automatically into FundingDesk, and Prescient says it is working on a link with Bloomberg that willbring in data on trades done on Bloomberg's CP platform. Companies can saveon funding costs by using the data to target less yield-sensitiveinvestors. They can also save money by knowing when competitors move ratesand then matching those moves. Using Funding Desk, we're much more in tuneto whether pricing is changing in the market, DaimlerChrysler's Nickoleysays. Besides cost savings, issuers may simply want to keep tabs on theirinvestors to ensure that no one investor holds too large a chunk, in orderto lessen the risk of having to scramble to find other buyers if a biginvestor exits suddenly."," Tue, 27 Nov 2001 09:38",,8079,1.0614488124847412,,,,

Questions of auditor independence and the use of pro forma statements are at the fore. Not far behind are ones on accounting for options and goodwill. And then there's the issue of which standards to use. Right now, ""who guards the guardians"" has leapfrogged to the top of the agenda. The Enron collapse shows that auditors need to be more independent. It's a thinly-disguised fiction that auditors are paid by and act on behalf of shareholders. Clearly, it's corporate management doing the hiring and firing of auditors. And audit itself makes little profit. Instead, accountants rely on consulting and more technical or specialized practices, like M&A, to generate fees. An accountant refusing to pass a company's results runs the risk of losing a big part of his own business. Even the risk of litigation isn't - or at least hasn't been pre-Enron - enough of a deterrent. What's the solution? Make sure companies that audit aren't swayed by conflicts of interest. Regulators should either encourage stand-alone audit firms or prohibit auditors from any other involvement with the companies they scrutinize - even if that's tricky for big international corporations, which can use all of the ""big five"" accounting firms in the course of a year's global dealings. Another dilemma is the issue of pro formas. There's a mounting consensus that pro forma statements are suspect. According to some estimates, pro forma results for S&P 500 companies during the third quarter overstated audited profits by 70%. Why should companies push their pro formas when, after all, there's a perfectly good U.S. audited accounting standard: the U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)? Enron notwithstanding, surveys show investors are more confident with U.S. corporate results than those from Europe or Japan. And yet, U.S. GAAP has its own problems. U.S. accounting is rigidly based on rules, unlike elsewhere, where it's more a case of applying broad principles. Though these rules are designed to ensure standards, they're often subverted by loopholes. U.S. companies can comply with the letter of the law but still offer a distorted picture of fundamentals. The result is that while investors are flooded with information, it's not always helpful in determining a company's value. Enron highlighted one such loophole. The company went under in large part because it was taking on huge, unseen liabilities. These liabilities weren't on the balance sheet, having been planted on special vehicles nominally independent of the firm."," Fri, 18 Jan 2002 14:32",,323622,1.0682804584503174,,,,

Mr. Mott further explains that Dynegy could be realizing more cash earnings now if it wanted to. But ""we don't see that would be in the best interests of shareholders,"" Mr. Mott says, because the company figures it can earn more later by leaving much of its gains unrealized for now.   Mr. Linsmeier of Michigan State compares the current situation for energy traders with the accounting controversies that engulfed subprime automobile and residential lenders during the late 1990s, though he emphasizes it's too far early to tell whether the consequences will be similar. Using so-called gain-on-sale accounting (a form of mark-to-market accounting), those lenders booked earnings from loans as soon as they were made, rather than having to wait for them to be paid off, as banks typically do.   But as interest rates fell in 1998, many customers paid off their loans earlier than expected, slashing lenders' profit margins. Compounding matters, the market for mortgage-backed securities dried up in the wake of financial chaos in Russia and other foreign markets, leaving lenders to bear the higher risks of many new loans.   Many investors complained they were blindsided, in part because these lenders generally hadn't disclosed their assumptions about prepayment rates and other variables. After the crash, subprime lenders routinely began disclosing the key assumptions used to value their mortgage portfolios.   At New York University, accounting professor Baruch Lev says investors would be better served if energy traders' financial filings explained the effects of hypothetical commodity-price movements on the values of their risk-management assets, and disclosed the basic assumptions about future commodity-price movements ingrained in their mathematical models. Says Mr. Lev, ""I would like to see much more disclosure, particularly given that this is now becoming a significant component of their earnings."""," Fri, 22 Sep 2000 10:33",,59549,1.0715267658233643,,,,

Enron, whose auditor was Arthur Andersen, filed forbankruptcy protection after posting a third-quarter loss of $1.01billion in October. The Houston-based company used off-balance-sheet financing vehicles that enabled it to boost leverage withoutreporting to investors the increased debt on its balance sheet.

Today, disclosures should becontinuous, not periodic, and include performance indicatorsbeyond earnings-per-share, Berardino said.

This email primarily focuses on inventory controls, funding of inventory, curve management process, and recruitment of paper traders. While it mentions the ongoing system development plans and the potential connection to EIM, there is no indication of accounting practices or manipulation of financial statements. Therefore, the score of 2 is assigned, indicating that this email does not exhibit significant abuse of accounting rules.","The first email indicates an abuse of the accounting rules with a score of 10, as it suggests that Enron was hiding losses by placing them in a separate entity called ""Raptors"" and then marking to market those assets.

Inventory ControlsAgain the reports produced here have been very specific to Enron Metals. Paul Wallace a manager in the co-ordination function is working extensively on developing the controls in this area. I would suggest that you contact Paul directly if you wish to discuss specific areas or inventory controls in general.3. Funding of inventoryWe have a structured finance facility here in London. The deal is specific to Enron Metals markets in that it works by reference to LME prices as these are the base index for all the positions placed in the facility. If structured financing is sort for EIM then it would be appropriate to talk to either David Tregar (Metals Commercial) or Bill Appleby (Global Finance) as an intro to the issues faced.4. Curve Management ProcessThe markets in which our merchanting division trades are based on the LME curves but are linked to a large number of basis curves for quality and location. Given the vast number we have opted to break down the markets by brand group and port location. E.G. for Copper this means we have a grid with 5 brand groups and 3 sets of port groups (13 for europe, 7 for the US and 6 for the Far East). The maintaince & price testing of the grids is made manageable by the fact the premiums only need be entered for brand and port groups by the traders yet prices can be tested by reference to node points i.e. price of specific brand at a given location which can be checked to a market quote.5. Re recruitment of paper tradersI haven't been able to contact him but I recall that the brother of David Rosenblum, one of the metals traders in Chicago, is a trader of recylced paper.I'll keep you posted on long term system development plans here in London.

I think the diagnostic measure should be, for each commodity DPR a report daily of all those signed off as final (note I do not neccessarily mean ""officialized"") after the relevant market opening time (usuaully 7.30 am)Timely confirmation and execution of transactions (completeness, accuracy, existence)Monthly report of all unmatched confirmations:- outstanding inward confirmations (i.e. sent out, not signed) - outstanding outward confirmations (i.e deal done, confirm not sent) - outstanding mismatched or disputed confirmationsshowing deal trade date, start date, commodity, counterparty, MTM value, agedSettlements with counterparties occurs accurately and timely (non CACS, non Dashed deals)Monthly report of cumulative amounts of all unmatched or unapplied cash:Unapplied cash by counterparty, in original denomination, including deal reference if anyUnmatched amounts by deal, where settled amount differs from maturing forward MTM valueOne additional thing that ocurred to me was the fact that those responsible for supplying the information are also those responsible for the operation underlying it in some sense, so the obvious pitfalls of self - assessment will come into play here.

(ENE) financial mess - stricter accounting rules governing consolidation of financial results.Enron acknowledged earlier Thursday that it incorrectly accounted for its relationships with related partnerships by keeping them off its financial statements. It corrected that mistake by consolidating the partnerhips into its results, a move that led Enron to restate three years worth of earnings, lowering them by a collective $586 million. Under current accounting regulations, companies don't have to consolidate loss or income from entities in which they have an interest below 51%, keeping those losses or gains off their books (the balance sheets and income statements). The Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, has been working on a project that would replace the standard of ownership by a more encompassing one of control. But that project has been languishing since 1982 when the board first started considering the issue. ""This is an area where FASB is struggling"" to set new criteria, said Alan Bromberg, a professor of corporate and securities law at the Dedeman School of Law of The Southern Methodist University. FASB has struggled in part because companies were fighting the changes and it has had difficulty in defining control to mean something other than majority ownership. The Enron's restatement and consolidation is also focusing attention on another arcane accounting rule, one dealing with minimum ownership by unaffiliated outsiders. Under a statement made by the Securities and Exchange Commission during an Emerging Issue Task Force meeting over a decade ago, the SEC stated that a minimum outside investment was needed for the special purpose entity to qualify for non consolidation. This guideline has remained in effect ever since. According to EITF documents dated 1989 and 1990, a minimum outside investment of 3% or more in a special purpose entity may be necessary, depending on the credit risk, for it to qualify for non-consolidation status. Given that some of the special entities created by Enron were controlled by some of its former executives, experts said it's possible that the SEC was considering the outside ownership of these entities insufficient for them to qualify for non consolidation. Meanwhile, it's unclear how Arthur Andersen LLP, Enron's independent auditor since the late 1980s, will be affected by the company's restatement and recent financial turmoil. A spokesman for Arthur Andersen said his firm ""continues to cooperate with Enron and its special committee to bring a resolution to this matter."" The accounting giant has had some recent run-ins with shareholders and regulators because of accounting issues. It recently agreed to pay $110 million to settle a shareholder lawsuit over audits it conducted for Sunbeam Corp. Sunbeam had been accused of overstating its revenues and subsequently went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy."," Fri, 9 Nov 2001 05:11",,260213,1.0884718894958496,,,,

Still, Andersen got unqualified good marks in its latest peer review, released Jan. 2.

Former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt, who appointed Turner, said last week that Pitt's proposal ``needs more teeth.'' An April 1997 letter, the earliest released under the freedom of information request, questioned whether cost saving in the name of efficiency was hurting the quality of audits and producing fewer records than peer reviewers needed. ""Some changes being undertaken in pursuit of operating goals, such as reducing audit hours and focusing audit objectives on increasing the perceived value of the audit to client management, may have the effect of compromising audit quality,'' wrote Michael Sutton, who was then SEC's chief accountant.

This email exhibits some questionable accounting practices, but not necessarily outright fraud. Here's the breakdown:

**Positive aspects:**

* **Transparency:** The email mentions the mark-to-market accounting practices and their potential perception as fraud. This demonstrates some awareness of potential issues and attempts to address them.
* **Confirmation:** The email clarifies and confirms the changes made to the $500M amount, demonstrating a willingness to rectify errors.

**Negative aspects:**

* **Misleading information:** The email states that the accounting practices are ""100% legal and trasparent,"" which is inaccurate. Mark-to-market accounting can be complex and difficult to understand for outsiders, and it's not necessarily transparent.
* **Lack of accountability:** The email does not provide any details about the reasons behind the changes or the process of ensuring accuracy and consistency in the future.

The review, performed by rival Big Five firm Deloitte & Touche, was part of an assessment carried out once every three years to check the quality of financial reporting of top firms.Andersen's accounting systems were ""deemed to provide reasonable assurance of compliance with professional standards,"" according to a statement from the Chicago-based firm. ""Deloitte's opinion was unmodified, without qualification,"" for the year ended Aug. 31, Andersen added. But the integrity of the process was criticized almost immediately by analysts, including professor Lynn Turner, a former Securities and Exchange Commission chief accountant and current director of the Center for Quality Financial Reporting at Colorado State University. ""If the process was really credible, I don't think we'd be having the rash of problems we are having today,"" Turner said. Turner cited reporting problems that have cost investors billions of dollars at Enron, such other Andersen clients as Waste Management Inc. and Sunbeam Corp., and similar high-profile failures at Cendant Corp., Rite Aid Corp. and MicroStrategy Inc. after audits by other accounting firms. Critics of the peer review process point to the fact that since the cooperative assessments began in 1978, no Big Five accounting firm has received a qualified opinion of its accounting procedures from a rival. When Enron filed for bankruptcy protection in December, it was Andersen's Houston office's largest client. The energy trader's collapse is the subject of a SEC investigation, lawsuits and a number of congressional probes. According to Deloitte's letter of comment, which accompanied the unqualified opinion, Andersen was told about a need to improve minor documentation and communication problems. Andersen's peer review was all but complete when it asked in November for the review to be expanded to include the Houston office responsible for auditing Enron, which had disclosed financial reporting problems that led to $1.2 billion being chopped from shareholders' equity. The assessment did not look specifically at the audit Andersen performed on Enron, because there is ""pending litigation"" over reporting problems, according to Deloitte's letter.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Thus, hedge accounting reduces the volatility createdby FAS 133 for companies that hedge their risk. However, FAS 133 contains astrict definition for a hedge, and an item could lose its character as ahedge because the definition is reapplied every quarter to the same item.The panelists noted that for tax purposes, once an item is considered ahedge, its character would not change subsequently.Price said the new FASB rule applies to entities that reportto the Securities Exchange Commission and are effective for fiscal yearsbeginning after June 15, 2000, and Jan. 1, 2001, for companies reporting ona calendar year.Ops Execs See Raised ProfileOperations Management - November 27, 2000Operations and technology executives are taking on a larger role withinfirms and ate receiving more senior job titles as a result, according to aRussell Reynolds Associates study to be released this week.

This email exhibits some questionable accounting practices, but not necessarily outright fraud. The main concerns are:

* **Lack of transparency:** The email lacks sufficient detail and documentation to support the reported revenue and expenses. It only provides a summary of the transactions without breaking down the individual items or providing any supporting documentation. This makes it difficult to verify the accuracy and legitimacy of the reported numbers.
* **Mischaracterization of expenses:** The email lumps various expenses under the heading ""Expense,"" without specifying the nature or category of each expense. This makes it difficult to understand the true breakdown of the company's expenses and assess their impact on the overall financial health.
* **Misuse of mark-to-market:** The email mentions ""mark-to-market accounting,"" but it does not explain how this accounting technique was used in relation to the transactions. This makes it difficult to determine whether the accounting practices employed were appropriate and in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles.

While these practices are concerning, they do not necessarily constitute outright fraud. The email does not involve deception or manipulation of financial records, nor does it aim to deceive investors or stakeholders. However, the lack of transparency and the mischaracterization of expenses make it difficult to assess the true financial health of the company and raise concerns about potential accounting malpractice.

Therefore, I would score this email an 8 out of 10. While it does not exhibit outright fraud, the lack of transparency and the mischaracterization of expenses make it a cause for concern and warrant further investigation.","The email with the subject ""P&L associated with Avista transaction to cover NW book of business (Jan 13-19)Third Week"" does not indicate any abuse of accounting rules.

**Explanation:**

This email indicates a potential issue with the accounting practices at Enron.

Subject: Project Timber EOTT Accounting Memo
<Email End>

Dear Lori and Mary,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to bring to your attention some concerns I have regarding the accounting practices for Project Timber. Specifically, I am concerned about the use of mark-to-market accounting and the potential misclassification of certain assets.

As you may know, mark-to-market accounting allows companies to recognize revenue based on the current market value of their assets, rather than their historical cost. While this approach can be useful in some circumstances, it also creates an incentive for companies to manipulate the values of their assets in order to show higher profits.

In the case of Project Timber, I have heard rumors that certain assets are being misclassified as ""level 3"" assets, which are considered to be more risky and less liquid than other types of assets. By doing so, we may be able to avoid recognizing losses on these assets and show higher profits.

However, this practice could potentially violate accounting rules and regulations, and could lead to serious consequences if discovered. I urge you both to review the accounting practices for Project Timber and ensure that they are in compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]","## Email Score

* **Potential manipulation:** The email suggests that the accounting practices are being used to manipulate the company's financial statements in order to make them appear more favorable. This could be seen as an abuse of the accounting rules.

The email indicates some potential accounting irregularities, but does not constitute outright fraud. The company acknowledged overstating its net income by a total of $586 million, or 20%, and admitted that the original accounting for certain transactions violated generally accepted accounting principles. However, the email does not provide sufficient evidence to support the claim that the accounting practices were intentionally designed to hide losses. The email primarily focuses on the company's admission of accounting errors and the potential impact on its financial statements. Therefore, the score of 6 reflects the potential for accounting irregularities, but not the severity of fraud.","The email with the subject ""What could Arthur Andersen have done to protect the investing public from Enron?"" is a score of 10 on the scale of 0 to 10, indicating that it indicates an abuse of accounting rules. The email discusses how Arthur Andersen's work for Enron may have contributed to the company's financial statements being ""just plain wrong"" and violating elementary accounting principles. This suggests that there was a significant misrepresentation of the company's finances, which is indicative of fraudulent behavior. The email also mentions that Andersen has cooperated with the SEC investigation into Enron's accounting practices, further suggesting that there may have been some wrongdoing on their part.","11/12/2001The Wall Street JournalC1(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)What could Arthur Andersen have done to protect the investing public from Enron? Brushing up on a basic accounting textbook might have helped, some critics say. Confirming investors' fears, the Houston energy trader Thursday filed a lengthy disclosure document with the Securities and Exchange Commission declaring that its financial statements going back to 1997 ""should not be relied upon"" and will have to be restated. Among other problems, Enron acknowledged overstating its net income by a total of $586 million, or 20%. Enron's financial statements long have been widely assailed as indecipherable. Now, it turns out, they were just plain wrong.But what is most striking about the latest disclosures is that they show Enron's misstatements weren't limited merely to judgment calls and gray areas for the green-eyeshade crowd to debate. Portions of Enron's accounting practices amounted to violations of elementary accounting principles, some accounting specialists say. Citing client-confidentiality rules, an Andersen spokesman, David Tabolt, declines to comment on his firm's work for Enron, which on Friday agreed to be bought by crosstown rival Dynegy. He calls Enron's disavowal of its previous financial statements an ""unfortunate situation"" and says Andersen is cooperating with the SEC's Enron investigation and the special committee formed by Enron to investigate the company's accounting and disclosure practices. Consider the primary reason for the $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity that Enron revealed in mid-October, sparking much of the downdraft in the company's shares. At the time, Enron said the reduction came about because it had decided to unwind certain transactions with some limited partnerships with which it had done business. On Thursday, however, Enron acknowledged that the original accounting for the transactions violated generally accepted accounting principles. Starting in early 2000, the company said last week, Enron issued shares of its own common stock to four ""special-purpose entities,"" in exchange for which it received a note receivable. Enron said it had increased both its note-receivable assets and shareholder equity, a move the company called ""an accounting error"" that it is correcting. Under GAAP, the payment a company receives when issuing stock only counts as equity if it is cash. As a result, Enron's 2000 audited financial statements overstated the company's notes-receivable assets and shareholder equity by $172 million. And Enron's 2001 unaudited statements overstated them by $828 million. The $1 billion overstatement represents 8.5% of Enron's previously reported shareholder equity as of June 30."," Mon, 12 Nov 2001 07:27",,260208,1.1092292070388794,,,,

All Rights Reserved. Top Of The News Dan Ackman, Forbes.com, 02.01.02, 9:26 AM ET ""Divide and conquer"" is often a winning strategy. Enron's wrinkle has long been ""divide and disavow,"" and it seems that, for the bankrupt energy trader and its lawyers, old gambits die hard. One of the principal components of the Enron scandal was the company's practice of creating partnerships and then using them to push its assets or debts off its books. Technically this can be legal, so long as the partnerships are truly separate, which, among other things, means that outside investors control as little as 3% of the partnership equity. The myth of separation--while still strongly believed by Enron itself--is losing support among the accounting firms who have been tainted by Enron and other recent scandals. The Big Five accounting firms are coming around to the idea that providing certain consulting services to the same company it is auditing creates an inherent conflict and is bad business. Until recently, the accounting profession bitterly opposed any limits on its consulting services, beating back rule changes proposed by Arthur Levitt when he was chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. But the Enron taint has spread past Enron's own auditor, Arthur Andersen, and the firms are seeking to police themselves lest others--such as the SEC--do it for them. PricewaterhouseCoopers and KPMG said yesterday said they would support such proposals. Andersen itself is said to be leaning in that direction and that it will soon announce substantial changes in how it does business. The Walt Disney Co. approved of the new regime of separation yesterday when its chairman, Michael Eisner, said the company would not use its independent auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers, for any new consulting work and would evaluate the current projects the accounting firm's consultants are currently doing for the company. Disney in 2000 paid PricewaterhouseCoopers $8.7 million in audit fees and around $32 million in non-audit fees. PricewaterhouseCoopers, for its part, said it intended to spin off its consulting arm in an IPO, which could mollify Disney and others. Arthur Andersen, in 2000, separated from its old consulting arm, now known as Accenture, after a long-running dispute between the two sides of the firm. But since then, Andersen itself has beefed up its own consulting practice. According to a report in The New York Times, just over half the $52 million it billed Enron in 2000 was for consulting."," Fri, 1 Feb 2002 14:29",,322908,1.116552710533142,,,,

This email exhibits some questionable accounting practices, but not necessarily outright fraud. The main concerns are:

* **Lack of transparency:** The email lacks sufficient detail and documentation to support the reported figures and transactions. 
* **Misleading revenue recognition:** The email highlights ""Gross Revenue"" and ""Net P&L"" without clearly stating whether these figures include the mark-to-market adjustments or not. This could be misleading and potentially misrepresent the true financial position of the company.
* **Lack of disclosure:** The email does not disclose the specific accounting practices used to hide the losses, such as the mark-to-market accounting methodology and the basis for determining the market value of the assets. This lack of disclosure makes it difficult for outsiders to assess the fairness and accuracy of the reported financial statements.

While the email does not explicitly engage in manipulative or deceptive accounting practices, the overall lack of transparency and misleading revenue recognition makes it difficult to determine the true financial health of the company.

* **Lack of disclosure:** The email does not disclose the specific accounting practices used to hide the losses, such as the mark-to-market accounting methodology and the basis for determining the market value of the assets. This lack of disclosure makes it difficult for outsiders to assess the fairness and accuracy of the reported financial statements.

While the email does not explicitly engage in manipulative or deceptive accounting practices, the overall lack of transparency and misleading revenue recognition makes it difficult to determine the true financial health of the company.

All Rights Reserved. Fed's Greenspan Comments on `Egregious' Accounting at Enron2002-01-24 12:40 (New York) Washington, Jan. 24 (Bloomberg) -- The following are comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on accounting practices at Enron Corp. Greenspan's remarks came during the question-and-answer part of testimony to the Senate Budget Committee. ``I think that the extraordinary response to Enron is something I think is very helpful and indeed an indication that the people in this society have required that we maintain a very high standard of trustworthiness in our business operations,'' Greenspan said. ``If everybody did what is alleged in the Enron accounting system, our system could not work,'' he said. ``That is, if you have a system, a market system, it works off information. If you don't have a way to evaluate a particular asset you cannot price it and if you cannot price it you cannot get the appropriate allocation of capital in a market society.'' As to Enron's accounting practices, Greenspan said: ``I think that was an egregious act. I tried as hard as I could to find an economic reason why those affiliates were constructed the way they were. The simplest explanation was the obvious explanation: that they did not want to indicate what their true earnings position was.'' Greenspan said he would be concerned about Enron's practices harming the economy ``if there wasn't a reaction to it.'' ``But the reaction, I think, is going to create a really major rethinking by a lot of people about whether there is a spin game going on with respect to the information coming out of business into the investment community,'' he said. While ``there's been an element of that'' in the past, ``I think there's going to be a good deal less of that. The old issue of competing for reputation is going to re-emerge. And I think you're going to find at some point that there are going to be people out there who are going to say `our accounts you can rely on' and that probably will increase their price-earnings ratios.''--Michael McKee in Washington (202) 624-1895 or mmckee@bloomberg.net.

This email exhibits some questionable accounting practices, but not necessarily outright fraud. The email highlights the potential issue of mark-to-market accounting practices being viewed as fraudulent, and mentions the company's desire to keep the old accounting convention alive in order to bolster their chances in litigation. However, the email does not provide enough information to determine whether the practices described are actually abusive or not.

**Here's a breakdown of the email:**

* **Potential for abuse:** The email mentions the potential for the mark-to-market accounting practices being viewed as fraudulent, which suggests that the author is aware of the potential for abuse.
* **Company's position:** The email emphasizes the company's desire to keep the old accounting convention alive, which could be seen as a tactic to hide losses.
* **Lack of transparency:** The email does not provide enough information about the specific accounting practices being discussed, making it difficult to assess their potential impact.
* **Lack of evidence:** The email does not provide any evidence to support the claims made about the potential abuse of accounting rules.

Overall, while the email does raise concerns about potential accounting malpractice, it does not provide enough information to determine whether the practices described are actually abusive or not. Therefore, I would score this email a 6.","The email with a score of 0 indicates that there was no abuse of the accounting rules, as it discusses legal and transparent practices.

Are we determined how we should deal with imbalances (part of cost of power)? [Fairley, David] There are three considerations on this: (1) who wears imbalance exposure?, (2) who manages imbalances (hourly type activity), and (3) who pays for imbalances? Imbalances are billed by Entergy directly to MDEA under their Network Services Agreement. EPMI's hourly desk manages the load/resource items hourly, but MDEA has the exposure (physical and price) to imbalances. Weather/load changes, and fluctuations in supply create hourly imbalances (they happen, they are uncontrollable, and we fix them) which EPMI's hourly desk manages as part of the imbalance service described in the definitions and obligations of the parties. A different section in the contract states that MDEA wears the exposure. How are we setting the bogey? Formula?

Both parties participate by providing certain necessary info and discussing results and planning the day's activities.

This email indicates some potential abuse of accounting rules, but not necessarily outright fraud. The email highlights concerns about the mark-to-market accounting practices used to hide losses and the potential conflict of interest with Enron's large fees to Andersen. However, it does not provide enough information to determine whether the practices are truly fraudulent or not. The email score of 6 reflects this ambiguity.

**Reasons for the score:**

* **Potential manipulation of accounting practices:** The email mentions concerns about the mark-to-market accounting practices being viewed as fraud, indicating that there may have been intent to deceive.
* **Lack of transparency:** The email does not provide enough details about the specific accounting practices or the reasons behind them, making it difficult to assess their appropriateness.
* **Potential conflict of interest:** The email mentions the potential conflict of interest with Enron's large fees to Andersen, highlighting the potential for bias and lack of objectivity.

**However:**

* **No concrete evidence of fraud:** The email does not provide any concrete evidence to support the allegations of fraud, such as documentation of falsified financial statements or evidence of intentional misappropriation of funds.
* **Potential overstatement:** The email score of 6 may be overly pessimistic. While the email indicates potential abuse of accounting rules, it does not necessarily constitute fraud.
* **Lack of context:** The email does not provide enough context about the overall situation, such as the company's financial standing, the nature of the transactions, and the motivations behind the accounting practices.

The email with the subject ""Accounting practices  did not report losses so revenue was realized as profit hidding true financial position"" also indicates an abuse of the accounting rules. The practice of hiding losses by reporting them in a separate entity is a clear violation of accounting standards and can be considered fraudulent behavior.
The email with the subject ""Accounting practices  we placed on the books are 100% legal and trasparent"" indicates that the company was aware of the abuse of the accounting rules but chose to continue with it anyway, which is a clear violation of ethical standards.

During the discussion, the Andersen executives noted Enron's fees to the firmeventually could total $100 million a year -- an amount that would have madeEnron the accounting firm's biggest client by far. The executives discussedwhether their decision to retain Enron was colored by the size of the fees, andthe memo suggests they were concerned about whether too much of Andersen'sEnron income was coming from nonaudit advisory work. ""Such amounts did nottrouble the participants as long as the nature of the services was not anissue,"" the memo says.  David Tabolt, an Andersen spokesman, said he was unaware of the memo and themeeting it recounts. ""I am unable to provide any comment until I look intothis,"" he said.

The Andersen memo doesn'tspecify if this was one of those regular meetings or if it was called for aparticular reason. Mr. Tabolt stressed that Andersen doesn't hesitate to droprisky clients for various reasons. ""We've dumped thousands of clients in recentyears,"" he said.  The memo was addressed to two Andersen officials, including David Duncan, whoheaded the Enron account and who Andersen this week said it fired foroverseeing the destruction of Enron-related documents after learning thatfederal regulators were examining the energy-trading company's finances.

This email falls into the category of ""potentially misleading"" rather than outright fraud. While the subject line and email content attempt to downplay the potential issues with the company's accounting practices, the overall tone and content do not necessarily convey the severity of the situation.

**Here's a breakdown of the email:**

* **Subject line:** ""iConference: Market-based Credit Risk Management"" - This subject line is misleading as it does not mention Enron or the company's accounting practices.
* **Email content:**

    * The email mentions ""benefits of portfolio diversification"" and ""risk mitigation tools,"" but does not explain how these benefits are related to the company's accounting practices.

Hi Tracy,
As discussed, we will continue to use mark-to-market accounting for our energy contracts. This approach allows us to recognize revenue from these contracts as soon as they are signed, rather than waiting until the contract expires.

Finally, the email with a score of 0 does not indicate any abuse of the accounting rules as it simply discusses the use of mark-to-market accounting practices which are legal and transparent.","First, though, the personal business touch is present in our economy. Iexercise the restraint to which your story pines in many of myconsulting engagements which require financial give and take betweenclient and vendor. It is simply smart business to do so. I have beenthe beneficiary of the same with my local bank when errors occurred inmy checking accounts, or when loan payments were made absent mindedlylate, etc., and the late fee forgiven. However, much of our economy,and certainly the trade of a commodity such as electricity requires theuse of markets. Nameless and faceless, they do squeeze out all theefficiencies which lead to lower prices, more innovation, and a sharingof price risk with parties who are neither the ultimate consumer nor theinitial producer. The producer and consumer get out of the riskarbitrage and leave it to others who are more skilled and monied.I find it ironic that TURN, then, is so insistent on arguing, as it hasdone on many many occasions for the relaxation of market separation inthe ISO=01,s congestion management reform. Elimination of marketseparation is nothing more than the impersonal forcing of parties toexecute trades on either side of a congested transmission path in thename of market efficiency. Lower prices for consumers. Does it reallymatter if it is done through person to person transactions, or throughmarkets?Third, your story can be used to make an alternative point. Whathappens to the merchant in town when Wal-Mart moves into the next towndown the road? All the faithful customers that your Merchant ofVengeance was protecting suddenly migrate to a competitor with greaterinventory, more choice, and lower prices. What do you say, then? Thecorollary for us is direct. The new generation owners moved literallybillions of dollars into California, at risk, and took a chance. Itpaid off. They succeeded as we all know this year, and probably willnext year, and so on. But the 3,000 MW of new power plants underconstruction in California, and the 3,000 MW under construction inArizona, and the over 16,000 MW of combined power projects inCalifornia, Arizona, and Southern Nevada that are in line for permitswill change the financial landscape in a hurry once energized. Theprices will soften, returns will be less cherry, and I really want toknow, where will today=01,s accusers be when there is a shake out?Consumers will reap that benefit, oh you best believe it. But thealliances to which your opening story alludes simply misses that point.You gotta make hay while the sun shines."," Thu, 24 Aug 2000 19:09",,62539,1.130334734916687,,,,
