As discussed, since our authorised signatories will be in different places, 
we will execute the CA in counterparts as follows:

1. You will print the attached CA for your Mr Muri Mohammad who will sign 
them on Monday in KL.

2. The signed CA will be faxed to you in London on Monday which you will 
deliver our Mr Clay Harris. 
A copy will also be faxed to me on Monday.

3. You will leave intructions for the original CA signed by Mr Muri Mohammad 
to be couriered to me in Singapore which I should receive by Tuesday. 

4. Our Mr Clay Harris will sign a counterpart CA and will deliver the 
original to you on Monday in exchange for the faxed counterpart signed by Mr 
Muri Mohammad.

February 2001. I confirm it is in order and attach herewith a clean version 
incorporating all your amendments. Please note that I have added Clay Harris' 
name and title to the execution clause.

As discussed, since our authorised signatories will be in different places, 
we will execute the CA in counterparts as follows:

1. You will print the attached CA for your Mr Muri Mohammad who will sign 
them on Monday in KL.

2. The signed CA will be faxed to you in London on Monday which you will 
deliver our Mr Clay Harris. 
A copy will also be faxed to me on Monday.

3. You will leave intructions for the original CA signed by Mr Muri Mohammad 
to be couriered to me in Singapore which I should receive by Tuesday. 

4. Our Mr Clay Harris will sign a counterpart CA and will deliver the 
original to you on Monday in exchange for the faxed counterpart signed by Mr 
Muri Mohammad.

Dear Sareen

Thank you for the marked up finalised version of the CA to be dated 26 
February 2001. I confirm it is in order and attach herewith a clean version 
incorporating all your amendments. Please note that I have added Clay Harris' 
name and title to the execution clause.

As discussed, since our authorised signatories will be in different places, 
we will execute the CA in counterparts as follows:

1. You will print the attached CA for your Mr Muri Mohammad who will sign 
them on Monday in KL.

2. The signed CA will be faxed to you in London on Monday which you will 
deliver our Mr Clay Harris. 
A copy will also be faxed to me on Monday.

3. You will leave intructions for the original CA signed by Mr Muri Mohammad 
to be couriered to me in Singapore which I should receive by Tuesday. 

4. Our Mr Clay Harris will sign a counterpart CA and will deliver the 
original to you on Monday in exchange for the faxed counterpart signed by Mr 
Muri Mohammad.

Dear Sareen

Thank you for the marked up finalised version of the CA to be dated 26 
February 2001. I confirm it is in order and attach herewith a clean version 
incorporating all your amendments. Please note that I have added Clay Harris' 
name and title to the execution clause.

As discussed, since our authorised signatories will be in different places, 
we will execute the CA in counterparts as follows:

1. You will print the attached CA for your Mr Muri Mohammad who will sign 
them on Monday in KL.

2. The signed CA will be faxed to you in London on Monday which you will 
deliver our Mr Clay Harris. 
A copy will also be faxed to me on Monday.

3. You will leave intructions for the original CA signed by Mr Muri Mohammad 
to be couriered to me in Singapore which I should receive by Tuesday. 

4. Our Mr Clay Harris will sign a counterpart CA and will deliver the 
original to you on Monday in exchange for the faxed counterpart signed by Mr 
Muri Mohammad.

Dear Sareen

Thank you for the marked up finalised version of the CA to be dated 26 
February 2001. I confirm it is in order and attach herewith a clean version 
incorporating all your amendments. Please note that I have added Clay Harris' 
name and title to the execution clause.

As discussed, since our authorised signatories will be in different places, 
we will execute the CA in counterparts as follows:

1. You will print the attached CA for your Mr Muri Mohammad who will sign 
them on Monday in KL.

2. The signed CA will be faxed to you in London on Monday which you will 
deliver our Mr Clay Harris. 
A copy will also be faxed to me on Monday.

3. You will leave intructions for the original CA signed by Mr Muri Mohammad 
to be couriered to me in Singapore which I should receive by Tuesday. 

4. Our Mr Clay Harris will sign a counterpart CA and will deliver the 
original to you on Monday in exchange for the faxed counterpart signed by Mr 
Muri Mohammad.

The email does not contain any clear evidence of hiding losses or abusing accounting rules. The discussion seems to be focused on the negotiation of a figure for an event of default in a contract, and there is no mention of mark-to-market accounting or SBEs (Special Purpose Entities). However, it is important to note that this email alone does not provide a complete picture of Enron's accounting practices. The context of these emails within the larger set of Enron communications and financial reports would be necessary to make a more definitive assessment.","Subject: Confidentiality Agreement - PETRONAS / ENRON

Dear Sareen

Thank you for the marked up finalised version of the CA to be dated 26 
February 2001. I confirm it is in order and attach herewith a clean version 
incorporating all your amendments. Please note that I have added Clay Harris' 
name and title to the execution clause.

As discussed, since our authorised signatories will be in different places, 
we will execute the CA in counterparts as follows:

1. You will print the attached CA for your Mr Muri Mohammad who will sign 
them on Monday in KL.

2. The signed CA will be faxed to you in London on Monday which you will 
deliver our Mr Clay Harris. 
A copy will also be faxed to me on Monday.

3. You will leave intructions for the original CA signed by Mr Muri Mohammad 
to be couriered to me in Singapore which I should receive by Tuesday. 

4. Our Mr Clay Harris will sign a counterpart CA and will deliver the 
original to you on Monday in exchange for the faxed counterpart signed by Mr 
Muri Mohammad.

Dear Sareen

Thank you for the marked up finalised version of the CA to be dated 26 
February 2001. I confirm it is in order and attach herewith a clean version 
incorporating all your amendments. Please note that I have added Clay Harris' 
name and title to the execution clause.

As discussed, since our authorised signatories will be in different places, 
we will execute the CA in counterparts as follows:

1. You will print the attached CA for your Mr Muri Mohammad who will sign 
them on Monday in KL.

2. The signed CA will be faxed to you in London on Monday which you will 
deliver our Mr Clay Harris. 
A copy will also be faxed to me on Monday.

3. You will leave intructions for the original CA signed by Mr Muri Mohammad 
to be couriered to me in Singapore which I should receive by Tuesday. 

4. Our Mr Clay Harris will sign a counterpart CA and will deliver the 
original to you on Monday in exchange for the faxed counterpart signed by Mr 
Muri Mohammad.

Dear Sareen

Thank you for the marked up finalised version of the CA to be dated 26 
February 2001. I confirm it is in order and attach herewith a clean version 
incorporating all your amendments. Please note that I have added Clay Harris' 
name and title to the execution clause.

As discussed, since our authorised signatories will be in different places, 
we will execute the CA in counterparts as follows:

1. You will print the attached CA for your Mr Muri Mohammad who will sign 
them on Monday in KL.

2. The signed CA will be faxed to you in London on Monday which you will 
deliver our Mr Clay Harris. 
A copy will also be faxed to me on Monday.

3. You will leave intructions for the original CA signed by Mr Muri Mohammad 
to be couriered to me in Singapore which I should receive by Tuesday. 

4. Our Mr Clay Harris will sign a counterpart CA and will deliver the 
original to you on Monday in exchange for the faxed counterpart signed by Mr 
Muri Mohammad.

Dear Sareen

Thank you for the marked up finalised version of the CA to be dated 26 
February 2001. I confirm it is in order and attach herewith a clean version 
incorporating all your amendments. Please note that I have added Clay Harris' 
name and title to the execution clause.

As discussed, since our authorised signatories will be in different places, 
we will execute the CA in counterparts as follows:

1. You will print the attached CA for your Mr Muri Mohammad who will sign 
them on Monday in KL.

2. The signed CA will be faxed to you in London on Monday which you will 
deliver our Mr Clay Harris. 
A copy will also be faxed to me on Monday.

3. You will leave intructions for the original CA signed by Mr Muri Mohammad 
to be couriered to me in Singapore which I should receive by Tuesday. 

4. Our Mr Clay Harris will sign a counterpart CA and will deliver the 
original to you on Monday in exchange for the faxed counterpart signed by Mr 
Muri Mohammad.

Dear Sareen

Thank you for the marked up finalised version of the CA to be dated 26 
February 2001. I confirm it is in order and attach herewith a clean version 
incorporating all your amendments. Please note that I have added Clay Harris' 
name and title to the execution clause.

As discussed, since our authorised signatories will be in different places, 
we will execute the CA in counterparts as follows:

1. You will print the attached CA for your Mr Muri Mohammad who will sign 
them on Monday in KL.

2. The signed CA will be faxed to you in London on Monday which you will 
deliver our Mr Clay Harris. 
A copy will also be faxed to me on Monday.

3. You will leave intructions for the original CA signed by Mr Muri Mohammad 
to be couriered to me in Singapore which I should receive by Tuesday. 

4. Our Mr Clay Harris will sign a counterpart CA and will deliver the 
original to you on Monday in exchange for the faxed counterpart signed by Mr 
Muri Mohammad.

Dear Sareen

Thank you for the marked up finalised version of the CA to be dated 26 
February 2001. I confirm it is in order and attach herewith a clean version 
incorporating all your amendments. Please note that I have added Clay Harris' 
name and title to the execution clause.

As discussed, since our authorised signatories will be in different places, 
we will execute the CA in counterparts as follows:

1. You will print the attached CA for your Mr Muri Mohammad who will sign 
them on Monday in KL.

2. The signed CA will be faxed to you in London on Monday which you will 
deliver our Mr Clay Harris. 
A copy will also be faxed to me on Monday.

3. You will leave intructions for the original CA signed by Mr Muri Mohammad 
to be couriered to me in Singapore which I should receive by Tuesday. 

4. Our Mr Clay Harris will sign a counterpart CA and will deliver the 
original to you on Monday in exchange for the faxed counterpart signed by Mr 
Muri Mohammad.

Dear Sareen

Thank you for the marked up finalised version of the CA to be dated 26 
February 2001. I confirm it is in order and attach herewith a clean version 
incorporating all your amendments. Please note that I have added Clay Harris' 
name and title to the execution clause.

As discussed, since our authorised signatories will be in different places, 
we will execute the CA in counterparts as follows:

1. You will print the attached CA for your Mr Muri Mohammad who will sign 
them on Monday in KL.

2. The signed CA will be faxed to you in London on Monday which you will 
deliver our Mr Clay Harris. 
A copy will also be faxed to me on Monday.

3. You will leave intructions for the original CA signed by Mr Muri Mohammad 
to be couriered to me in Singapore which I should receive by Tuesday. 

4. Our Mr Clay Harris will sign a counterpart CA and will deliver the 
original to you on Monday in exchange for the faxed counterpart signed by Mr 
Muri Mohammad.

Dear Sareen

Thank you for the marked up finalised version of the CA to be dated 26 
February 2001. I confirm it is in order and attach herewith a clean version 
incorporating all your amendments. Please note that I have added Clay Harris' 
name and title to the execution clause.

As discussed, since our authorised signatories will be in different places, 
we will execute the CA in counterparts as follows:

1. You will print the attached CA for your Mr Muri Mohammad who will sign 
them on Monday in KL.

2. The signed CA will be faxed to you in London on Monday which you will 
deliver our Mr Clay Harris. 
A copy will also be faxed to me on Monday.

3. You will leave intructions for the original CA signed by Mr Muri Mohammad 
to be couriered to me in Singapore which I should receive by Tuesday. 

4. Our Mr Clay Harris will sign a counterpart CA and will deliver the 
original to you on Monday in exchange for the faxed counterpart signed by Mr 
Muri Mohammad.

Dear Sareen

Thank you for the marked up finalised version of the CA to be dated 26 
February 2001. I confirm it is in order and attach herewith a clean version 
incorporating all your amendments. Please note that I have added Clay Harris' 
name and title to the execution clause.

As discussed, since our authorised signatories will be in different places, 
we will execute the CA in counterparts as follows:

1. You will print the attached CA for your Mr Muri Mohammad who will sign 
them on Monday in KL.

2. The signed CA will be faxed to you in London on Monday which you will 
deliver our Mr Clay Harris. 
A copy will also be faxed to me on Monday.

3. You will leave intructions for the original CA signed by Mr Muri Mohammad 
to be couriered to me in Singapore which I should receive by Tuesday. 

4. Our Mr Clay Harris will sign a counterpart CA and will deliver the 
original to you on Monday in exchange for the faxed counterpart signed by Mr 
Muri Mohammad.

The email does not indicate any clear abuse of accounting rules or hiding of losses. It primarily discusses delays in IT implementation and the prioritization of off-balance sheet financing, which is a common business issue and not necessarily indicative of fraudulent activity. The tone of the email suggests a desire for improved communication and transparency, rather than an attempt to hide information.","Subject: Confidentiality Agreement - PETRONAS / ENRON

Dear Sareen

Thank you for the marked up finalised version of the CA to be dated 26 
February 2001. I confirm it is in order and attach herewith a clean version 
incorporating all your amendments. Please note that I have added Clay Harris' 
name and title to the execution clause.

As discussed, since our authorised signatories will be in different places, 
we will execute the CA in counterparts as follows:

1. You will print the attached CA for your Mr Muri Mohammad who will sign 
them on Monday in KL.

2. The signed CA will be faxed to you in London on Monday which you will 
deliver our Mr Clay Harris. 
A copy will also be faxed to me on Monday.

3. You will leave intructions for the original CA signed by Mr Muri Mohammad 
to be couriered to me in Singapore which I should receive by Tuesday. 

4. Our Mr Clay Harris will sign a counterpart CA and will deliver the 
original to you on Monday in exchange for the faxed counterpart signed by Mr 
Muri Mohammad.

Dear Sareen

Thank you for the marked up finalised version of the CA to be dated 26 
February 2001. I confirm it is in order and attach herewith a clean version 
incorporating all your amendments. Please note that I have added Clay Harris'

we will execute the CA in counterparts as follows:

1. You will print the attached CA for your Mr Muri Mohammad who will sign 
them on Monday in KL.

2. The signed CA will be faxed to you in London on Monday which you will 
deliver our Mr Clay Harris. 
A copy will also be faxed to me on Monday.

3. You will leave intructions for the original CA signed by Mr Muri Mohammad 
to be couriered to me in Singapore which I should receive by Tuesday. 

4. Our Mr Clay Harris will sign a counterpart CA and will deliver the 
original to you on Monday in exchange for the faxed counterpart signed by Mr 
Muri Mohammad.

Dear Sareen

Thank you for the marked up finalised version of the CA to be dated 26 
February 2001. I confirm it is in order and attach herewith a clean version 
incorporating all your amendments. Please note that I have added Clay Harris'

As discussed, since our authorised signatories will be in different places, 
we will execute the CA in counterparts as follows:

1. You will print the attached CA for your Mr Muri Mohammad who will sign 
them on Monday in KL.

2. The signed CA will be faxed to you in London on Monday which you will 
deliver our Mr Clay Harris. 
A copy will also be faxed to me on Monday.

3. You will leave intructions for the original CA signed by Mr Muri Mohammad 
to be couriered to me in Singapore which I should receive by Tuesday. 

4. Our Mr Clay Harris will sign a counterpart CA and will deliver the 
original to you on Monday in exchange for the faxed counterpart signed by Mr 
Muri Mohammad.

Dear Sareen

Thank you for the marked up finalised version of the CA to be dated 26 
February 2001. I confirm it is in order and attach herewith a clean version 
incorporating all your amendments. Please note that I have added Clay Harris' 
name and title to the execution clause.

As discussed, since our authorised signatories will be in different places, 
we will execute the CA in counterparts as follows:

1. You will print the attached CA for your Mr Muri Mohammad who will sign 
them on Monday in KL.

2. The signed CA will be faxed to you in London on Monday which you will 
deliver our Mr Clay Harris. 
A copy will also be faxed to me on Monday.

3. You will leave intructions for the original CA signed by Mr Muri Mohammad 
to be couriered to me in Singapore which I should receive by Tuesday. 

4. Our Mr Clay Harris will sign a counterpart CA and will deliver the 
original to you on Monday in exchange for the faxed counterpart signed by Mr 
Muri Mohammad.

Dear Sareen

Thank you for the marked up finalised version of the CA to be dated 26 
February 2001. I confirm it is in order and attach herewith a clean version 
incorporating all your amendments. Please note that I have added Clay Harris'

we will execute the CA in counterparts as follows:

1. You will print the attached CA for your Mr Muri Mohammad who will sign 
them on Monday in KL.

2. The signed CA will be faxed to you in London on Monday which you will 
deliver our Mr Clay Harris. 
A copy will also be faxed to me on Monday.

3. You will leave intructions for the original CA signed by Mr Muri Mohammad 
to be couriered to me in Singapore which I should receive by Tuesday. 

4. Our Mr Clay Harris will sign a counterpart CA and will deliver the 
original to you on Monday in exchange for the faxed counterpart signed by Mr 
Muri Mohammad.

Dear Sareen

Thank you for the marked up finalised version of the CA to be dated 26 
February 2001. I confirm it is in order and attach herewith a clean version 
incorporating all your amendments. Please note that I have added Clay Harris'

As discussed, since our authorised signatories will be in different places, 
we will execute the CA in counterparts as follows:

1. You will print the attached CA for your Mr Muri Mohammad who will sign 
them on Monday in KL.

2. The signed CA will be faxed to you in London on Monday which you will 
deliver our Mr Clay Harris. 
A copy will also be faxed to me on Monday.

3. You will leave intructions for the original CA signed by Mr Muri Mohammad 
to be couriered to me in Singapore which I should receive by Tuesday. 

4. Our Mr Clay Harris will sign a counterpart CA and will deliver the 
original to you on Monday in exchange for the faxed counterpart signed by Mr 
Muri Mohammad.

Dear Sareen

Thank you for the marked up finalised version of the CA to be dated 26 
February 2001. I confirm it is in order and attach herewith a clean version 
incorporating all your amendments. Please note that I have added Clay Harris' 
name and title to the execution clause.

As discussed, since our authorised signatories will be in different places, 
we will execute the CA in counterparts as follows:

1. You will print the attached CA for your Mr Muri Mohammad who will sign 
them on Monday in KL.

2. The signed CA will be faxed to you in London on Monday which you will 
deliver our Mr Clay Harris. 
A copy will also be faxed to me on Monday.

3. You will leave intructions for the original CA signed by Mr Muri Mohammad 
to be couriered to me in Singapore which I should receive by Tuesday. 

4. Our Mr Clay Harris will sign a counterpart CA and will deliver the 
original to you on Monday in exchange for the faxed counterpart signed by Mr 
Muri Mohammad.
