record keeping accounting practices,1,"Is there a way our accounting guru's can unwind these deals now? Ihave thought and thought about a way to do this, but I keep bumping intoone big problem -- we booked the Condor and Raptor deals in 1999 and2000, we enjoyed wonderfully high stock price, many executives soldstock, we then try and reverse or fix the deals in 2001, and it's a bitlike robbing the bank in one year and trying to pay it back two yearslater. Nice try, but investors were hurt, they bought at $70 and $80 ashare looking for $120 a share and now they're at $38 or worse. We areunder too much scrutiny and there are probably one or two disgruntled''redeployed'' employees who know enough about the ''funny'' accountingto get us in trouble. What do we do? I know this question cannot be addressed in theall-employee meeting, but can you give some assurances that you andCausey will sit down and take a good hard objective look at what isgoing to happen to Condor and Raptor in 2002 and 2003? Summary of Alleged Issues: RAPTOR Entity was capitalized with LJM equity. That equity is atrisk; however, the investment was completely offset by a cash fee paidto LJM. If the Raptor entities go bankrupt LJM is not affected, there isno commitment to contribute more equity. The majority of the capitalization of the Raptor entities is someform of Enron N/P, restricted stock and stock rights. Enron entered into several equity derivative transactions with theRaptor entities locking in our values for various equity investments wehold. As disclosed in 2000, we recognized $500 million of revenue from theequity derivatives offset by market value changes in the underlyingsecurities. This year, with the value of our stock declining, the underlyingcapitalization of the Raptor entities is declining and credit is pushingfor reserves against our MTM positions. To avoid such a write-down or reserve in quarter one 2001, we''enhanced'' the capital structure of the Raptor vehicles, committingmore ENE shares. My understanding of the third-quarter problem is that we must''enhance'' the vehicles by $250 million. I realize that we have had a lot of smart people looking at this anda lot of accountants including AA & Co. have blessed the accountingtreatment. None of that will protect Enron if these transactions areever disclosed in the bright light of day. (Please review the late 90'sproblems of Waste Management -- where AA paid $130 million plus inlitigation re questionable accounting practices.) The overriding basic principle of accounting is that if you explainthe ''accounting treatment'' to a man in the street, would you influencehis investing decisions? Would he sell or buy the stock based on athorough understanding of the facts? If so, you best present itcorrectly and/or change the accounting.",0.8,0.8,0.9,0.0

The profession has been d=ebating how to account for SPEs for many years. It's time to rethink the ru=les.=20-- Modernizing our broken financial-reporting model. Enron's collapse, like= the dot-com meltdown, is a reminder that our financial-reporting model -- =with its emphasis on historical information and a single earnings-per-share= number -- is out of date and unresponsive to today's new business models, =complex financial structures, and associated business risks.=20Enron disclosed reams of information, including an eight-page Management's =Discussion & Analysis and 16 pages of footnotes in its 2000 annual report. =Some analysts studied these, sold short and made profits.

Enron's Lay Faces Subpoenas From Congressional Panels
2002-02-04 14:56 (New York)
     Washington, Feb. 4 (Bloomberg) -- Lawmakers say they'll force former Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth Lay to appear before congressional committees investigating the collapse of what was once the largest energy trader.
     Senators Ernest Hollings and Byron Dorgan said they'll seek a subpoena for Lay to bring him before the Commerce Committee Feb. 12.  The House Financial Services Capital Markets Subcommittee unanimously authorized a subpoena for Lay today. Lay yesterday canceled scheduled appearances before both committees.
     Hollings also called for a special prosecutor to head the Justice Department investigation of Enron's failure because of financial and business ties between the company and members of President George W. Bush's administration.
     ""There are so many questions, and we wanted to start with the chairman and CEO, Mr. Lay, to ask him what happened, what do you know of what happened, who's accountable and who's responsible,'' Dorgan, who is leading the Senate Commerce Committee investigation into Enron, said at a news conference.
     A 203-page Enron internal review, released on Saturday, concluded that company executives enriched themselves while hiding at least $1 billion in losses in 3,000 partnerships that led to bankruptcy, the biggest in U.S. history. The study was commissioned by Enron's board and led by University of Texas Law School Dean William Powers.

Other Executives

     Former Enron Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Skilling intends to keep his Thursday appointment with the House Energy and Commerce Committee and he'll answer questions, his spokeswoman Judy Leon said.
     Former Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, who the company said earned $30 million from buying and selling company property and assets, is scheduled to appear with Skilling Thursday before the commerce committee. His spokesman refused to comment on any aspect of Fastow's scheduled appearance.
     Powers is scheduled to testify before the House Financial Services subcommittee this afternoon, along with Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey Pitt.

RANDOM,0,"Subject: Continental Customer Advisory

Dear Ms. Scott,

Continental Airlines is committed to meeting new federal requirements regarding checked baggage and airport security fees. In an effort to keep you informed, below are the most recent changes that will affect your travel:

POSITIVE BAG MATCH
Effective January 18, 2002 the Federal Aviation Administration will require a positive bag match for travel within the U.S., its territories and commonwealths. Bags cannot be transported on the aircraft without confirmation that the customer has boarded the aircraft.

DOMESTIC CHECK-IN/ARRIVAL TIME
To ensure compliance with the Positive Bag Match policy without delays or inconvenience, Continental Airlines has changed the boarding time for domestic flights for tickets purchased on or after January 18, 2002. Customers checking baggage must do so at least 30 minutes prior to departure. All customers must be checked in and at the boarding gate no later than 15 minutes prior to scheduled departure. Customers who buy tickets on or after January 18, 2002 who are not at the boarding gate 15 minutes prior to departure are subject to having their reservations canceled, seats released and checked baggage removed from the flight.

SECURITY FEE
The Transportation Security Administration is requiring that airlines collect the September 11th Security Fee of $2.50 per enplanement, not to exceed $5.00 each way or $10.00 per round-trip ticket. This security fee goes into effect for tickets purchased on or after February 1, 2002. It applies to qualifying enplanements from airports in the U.S., its territories and commonwealths. This fee applies to all tickets including frequent flyer reward tickets, two-for-one tickets, tour conductors and infants for whom a fare has been collected.

Continental Airlines continues to make safety our number one priority. Be sure to stay informed with continental.com at:
before leaving for the airport. We're looking forward to welcoming you onboard!

Sincerely,
Mark F. Bergsrud
Vice President, Marketing
Continental Airlines, Inc.

Richard,

Following our coversation of yesterday, I set out for you below the following:

1.  An explanation (in draft) of the Dutch power market and the events 
leading up to the current market ""squeeze"" by certain players, which we have 
produced and discussed for our external lawyers.

2.  A schematic of arguments which we produced for external lawyers before 
Christmas just relating to the mis-application of capacity by TenneT.

3.  A copy of our e-mail to Clifford Chance of last Wednesday summarising the 
issues in order of priority for their advice.

Please note that, purely on the swap element of this jigsaw, we are 
attempting to arrange a conference with a Queen's Counsel for next Monday 
afternoon.  Hence, it may be better for our meeting (with Jeff patched-in) to 
take place next Tuesday - clearly the advice on all the elements involved (as 
set out in 3) in toto will not be complete until we have had the conference 
with the QC.

I am due to receive tomorrow, however, from Clifford Chance their legal 
strategy report on all the other issues raised in my e-mail (item 3) and 
shall forward you a copy on receipt.   

Kind regards

q ? We rate PFGI 2-Buy and expect the company to put down EPS growth rates
ahead of its peers
once current issues are put to bed. However, we believe the next few
quarters could be bumpy and
that PFGI's business model, which is heavily exposed to commercial loans, is
more susceptible to
downturns in the economy.
q We expect PFGI to report 3Q01 EPS of $0.70 on October 17. This compares to
$0.63 in the prior quarter.
q While continued loan growth and fee income expansion should lead to
double-digit revenue growth, higher
credit costs and the lack of net interest margin expansion should restrain
further improvement.

q We expect SNV to report 3Q01 EPS of $0.27 on October 17.
q Continued net interest margin expansion and solid loan growth should lead

if new business related to its

Subject: Alliance Info Alert - FERC Reporting




Attached is a summary of recent FERC activities (PDF file) and the weekly 
Alliance Express. The following is a summary of the most recent FERC meeting, 
followed by a listing of the most recent FERC filings.

In a brief meeting yesterday, FERC approved a Final Rule adopting Section 203 
merger filing requirements, generally as proposed, and extended the existing 
NYISO bid cap in its non-spinning reserves market and the related mandatory 
bidding requirement until such time that the New York market can be 
determined to be ""workably competitive.""  At the same time, FERC ordered a 
technical conference to explore changes to the NYISO reserves market, and 
urged market participants to reach a consensus on a preferred solution, next 
steps, and deadlines for resolution/implementation.  Additional details are 
provided below.

FERC Updates, Streamlines Merger Filing Process

FERC unanimously approved its proposed Order revising the reporting 
requirements for mergers.  However, Comm. Hebert did so with reservations, as 
discussed below.  Commission staff stated that the Order closely follows the 
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking previously issued, but adds more detail and 
more certainty to the industry.  Staff stated that the Order is improved over 
the proposed rule because it includes exemptions from reporting for certain 
entities and it more precisely defines geographical areas and products.

According to FERC, the draft Order:

-  revises the Commission's filing requirements to reflect existing merger 
policy based on FERC's 1996 Merger Policy Guidelines;
-  provides more detail for the industry in developing competitive market 
analyses.  The rule continues the existing screening process for mergers with 
potential horizontal competitive concerns.  In addition, the rule establishes 
informational requirements for vertical competitive analyses.
-  streamlines filing requirements for transactions that do not raise 
competitive concerns; and
-  reduces the industry's regulatory burden by eliminating outdated filing 
requirements.

The Rule will take effect 60 days after its publication in the Federal 
Register.

Commissioner Reaction:

Comm. Hebert expressed reservations that, although he was voting for the 
Rule, FERC should not be duplicating the Department of J",0.0,0.0,0.7,0.0
mark to market losses,0,"The quantitative equity research team at Lehman Brothers has studied recent market history in search of patterns in tax-driven selling. In the process, the analysts came up with a list of 131 stocks that look vulnerable to persistent weakness through most of the fourth quarter. The study scanned the Russell 3000 index -- basically the 3,000 largest U.S. stocks -- for those that had fallen at least 40% this year through September, and had lost at least 10% in the prior six months. They also plucked only those stocks that had seen rising trading volume over that period. The idea was to find only those names that seem to be in the throes of a selling crescendo. In 1997, there were just eight such stocks. In 1998, there were 202 and last year 101, on a par with this year's tired crop. Murali Ramaswami of Lehman says, ""There's both a tax-loss story and a momentum story. Losers continue to be losers."" At least through the fourth quarter they do. The negative momentum of these stocks tends to gather speed from the first week of November to Christmas. In this period, from 1997 through last year, the Losers Portfolio dropped an average of 20% more than did the Russell 3000 index. Bottom-fishers, beware. The resulting list, which Lehman billed to its institutional clients as a menu for hungry short-sellers, features numerous stocks caught in the major downside themes of the year. Name a major telecom-services provider and the odds are good it's in this bunch, the result of a stampede away from the group. Big retailers also dot the down-on-their-luck roster, as the slowing economy has ravaged shares of Circuit City, Dillards, Saks and others. And of course there are plenty of dot.com names experiencing the ugly side of a mania undone, in a reversal that has made some mere flyspecks on the market's windshield.

""In our view, the fundamental failures of the Enron directors to exercise their legal mandate to protect the interests of Enron shareholders demonstrates the Enron directors' substantial unfitness to serve as an officer or director,"" Trumka wrote in the letter to Pitt. 
SEC spokeswoman Christi Harlan declined to comment. ""We haven't had a chance to see the letter yet,"" she said. 
The AFL-CIO said the SEC has the power to ask a court to issue a ""substantial unfitness bar order"" against directors. 
Spokespersons for the directors of Enron could not immediately be reached for comment. 
The internal report released on Saturday, known as the Powers Report, faulted Enron's directors for not paying closer attention to questionable financial dealings that led Enron on Dec. 2 to file the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history. 
The AFL-CIO, along with the British Trades Union Congress, called on Britain's Institute of Chartered Accountants to probe whether Lord John Wakeham breached professional and ethical standards in his role as an Enron director. 
Wakeham said last week he was stepping aside temporarily as chairman of Britain's Press Complaints Commission to answer questions about his links to Enron. 
Trades Union Congress General Secretary John Monks said, ""As a member of (Enron's) audit and compliance committee, Lord Wakeham has some very hard questions to answer. The ICA must ask whether its rules and standards were breached."" 
In addition to Winokur and Wakeham, other Enron directors named by the AFL-CIO in its request included Robert Belfer, Ronnie Chan, John Duncan, Wendy Gramm, Robert Jaedicke, former Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay, John Mendelsohn and Frank Savage.

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp.'s (ENRNQ) next big thing is the latest group of assets the company has put up for sale. 
Last month, Enron distributed a CD-ROM listing the telecommunications assets it is selling. Assets include fiber-optic data-transmission networks, telecom real estate and a few warehouses full of telecom equipment.
A spokesman for Enron said he didn't know how much the company had invested in the broadband assets. An analyst said Enron spent $800 million ",0.0,0.0,0.3,0.2

The data is the most accurate data on field receipts and well completions in the US.  Chris believes that he can create an accurate production forecast model by basin and county.  This would give us an edge in the overall and basis market.

Hunter,

IHS
We met with IHS this morning to discuss the data that we need to complete our supply forecasts.  It is our intent to use the monthly historical production data in combination with well completion data, rig counts, and drilling permits to build a more accurate production forecast.  We need complete well characteristic data (depth, basin, age) in order to be accurate.  

In order to reach the goal above, we need to invest in two data services from IHS:

	US Production data - monthly volumes from all wells in the US updated on a lag of 1-6 months - $159,500/Yr. delivered on CD-ROM monthly
	US Well data - well characteristics updated monthly, data age is only limited by CD-ROM delivery - $154,000/Yr. delivered on CD-ROM monthly

Next year, we will be able to cut the US Well data and add Scout Express, which will cut the cost by $115,500.  Scout Express has only one year of historical well data, so it does not currently meet our needs.  We will be able to do this after we build the historical well information into our supply forecast.

Danielle Marcinkowski is working with IHS on the contract for the data, she is going to try and negotiate the price this afternoon.  She anticipated having the contract today, and sending it to Chicago for approval.

PIRA
Danielle is working to finalize the agreement in the next 3 days.  I gave her a list of the services that we needed, and told her that we would like to distribute the PIRA material on the Commodity Fundamentals website instead of having individual user accounts.  Based on the services that I think we'll need (North Americal Natural Gas, North American Electricity, and the Daily Demand Forecast), our combined cost for Gas and Power in Houston, Portland, Calgary, and Toronto should be around $100,000 for 100 users.  Danielle is going to send an e-mail when she has the final price.

Let me know if you have any questions.

it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,0,"10/17/2001Financial Times (U.K. edition)(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights ReservedCOMPANIES & FINANCE THE AMERICAS - Enron tries to see bright side of $1bn levy - DIVERSIFIED INDUSTRIALS FAILED INVESTMENTS IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS, ENERGY AND WATER TAKE THEIR TOLL. Enron, the US energy trader, yesterday attempted to reassure the market after it revealed a hefty $1.01bn charge related to its failed investments in telecommunications, retail energy sales and water businesses.The Houston-based company outlined a recovery plan, including more asset sales, but the charge, along with a weaker-than-expected performance in Europe and no sign of improvement in its broadband division overshadowed any good news. Some analysts, who had exerted pressure on the company to release detailed financial results, warned of more surprises at an analysts meeting in New York tomorrow. Moody's Investors Service placed Enron's $13bn of debt securities on review for downgrade. By midday in New York, the company's shares were 17 cents lower at $33, continuing a 60 per cent share slide this year. Ken Lay, the chairman who is back at the helm after the abrupt resignation of former chief executive Jeff Skilling in August, said he had three main concerns. Enron remains entangled in the fallout from the California energy crisis, the sale of its troubled Dahol power project in India and the slump in the broadband division, he said. ""Investors have been willing to overlook a lack of clarity with Enron but now with more difficult times, they want to dig a little deeper. Enron should have been doing that all along,"" said Chris Ellinghause, analyst at Williams Capital Group. Mr Lay said yesterday that Enron planned to offload other assets after selling its electricity utility Portland General Electric to Northwest Natural Gas for $1.8bn this month. Mr Lay said that despite the charge, the company had had a strong quarter and the fundamentals remained strong. ""There is some optimism for the fourth quarter and for next year. We have cleaned up some operations and hopefully by doing this, we will get a sharper focus on the company's true strengths and growth to come."" Earlier, Mr Lay revealed a $618m, or 84 cents a share, loss for the quarter, against a profit of $292m, or 34 cents, last time. The charges included $544m for losses on investments in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments. The company took a $180m charge to restructure its broadband division and a $287m loss related to Azurix, the water treatment and infrastructure business. Revenue jumped 60 per cent to $47.6bn. The company's main profit driver, its wholesale energy division, had strong results in its natural gas and electricity trading, especially in North America. Asked if Enron intended to report any other charges, Mr Lay said: ""If we thought we had other impaired assets they would be on the list today."" (c) Copyright Financial Times Ltd.

First,  Scott is having a wine tasting (Australian) this Wednesday at 
Galleria Ruggles.  I don't yet know the cost, but thought one or both of you 
might be interested in coming.  I am going this time, and I think Hollis is 
too.  Might be fun.  It is not a full dinner, just wines and appetizer type 
stuff.

Second;  Mark

Most Fridays I will need to pick up William from after care at school, 
requiring about a 5:30 departure for me.  Scott plans to oridnarily pick up 
every other day of the week.  If I have a big project etc. I will come back 
in with William.  However, I realize you generally want people available 
until 6 each day.  Hopefully, this will not cause too much trouble.  Mary

mark to market accounting practices,1,"""It is basic accounting that you don't record equity until you get cash, and a note doesn't count as cash,"" says Lynn Turner, a former chief accountant for the SEC. ""The question that raises is: How did both partners and the manager on this audit miss this simple Accounting 101 rule?"" Adds Douglas Carmichael, an accounting professor at Baruch College in New York: ""Anyone that's an accountant looking at the entry should have known"" it violated GAAP. An Enron spokesman, Vance Meyer, says, ""The accounting error was just that -- an error,"" explaining that, ""We believed it was not material. However, it was, of course, corrected . . . And we did make the correction with Andersen's concurrence."" He says Andersen ""performed limited quarterly reviews"" of the company's unaudited financial statements and reviewed the entries that resulted in the shareholder-equity overstatements ""to the extent they deemed necessary."" To some who follow the accounting world closely, this has a familiar ring to it. During the past few years, every Big Five auditor has been hit by multiple accounting debacles at high-profile clients. For Andersen, Enron joins a list including Waste Management Inc. and Sunbeam Corp. While the names of the clients may change, the issues remain largely the same. For instance, Enron had reported net income of $105 million for 1997, a figure that Enron last week said will be reduced to $9 million in its upcoming restatement for that year. Enron said the reduction is mostly because of $51 million in various unexplained ""audit adjustments and reclassifications"" that its auditors had proposed in 1997 but at the time had determined to be ""immaterial."" Cumulatively, those immaterial adjustments added up to nearly half of Enron's net income for 1997 and now will be included in the company's restatements. That looks a lot like what happened at Sunbeam. According to the SEC's May settlement order with Sunbeam, Andersen auditors had routinely dismissed so many violations of GAAP as immaterial that they eventually piled up to produce significant distortions in Sunbeam's financial statements, making the barely solvent consumer-products maker look handsomely profitable. Sunbeam filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court protection this past February. In May, the SEC filed a civil lawsuit against five former Sunbeam executives and the Andersen partner in charge of the company's audit, accusing them of engaging in a massive financial fraud; all six defendants have denied the SEC's allegations. Andersen itself wasn't named as a defendant and has said it believes the lawsuit against its partner was an unjustified action over questions of professional judgment.",1.0,0.5,0.8,0.6

it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,1,"By Bryan LeeWASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--The Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) board member who spearheaded an internal investigation told a House investigating panel Tuesday that key company executives should have been aware of liabilities with the company's off-the-balance-sheet partnerships, but he declined to assert that investors had been defrauded. William Powers, dean of the University of Texas law school, told the House Energy and Commerce Committee's oversight and investigations panel that top executives should have known that transactions with the partnerships were designed to hide billions in losses from public scrutiny. Key Enron executives involved in the partnerships ""were definitely using Enron assets to enrich themselves,"" Powers testified. But he repeatedly declined to describe their actions as fraud, despite several attempts by lawmakers. ""I'm not in a position...to say,"" Powers told Rep. Peter Deutsch, D-Fla., when he asked if shareholders were defrauded. When Deutsch pressed him for an answer, Powers replied that he wasn't in a position to determine the ""state of mind"" of the Enron officials involved in the partnership dealings. But Powers told Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., the committee's chairman, that there were no other discernible purposes of the partnerships except to hide the company's debt and enrich key senior Enron officers. ""What we really have here is a case of inside theft,"" Tauzin said. Powers painted a highly critical picture of the roles played by former Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay; former Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling; former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow; former managing director of an Enron unit, Michael Kopper; Chief Accounting and Information Officer Richard Causey; and Chief Risk Officer Richard Buy. Many of those implicated by Powers are slated to testify before the committee Thursday. Powers, in an apparent reference to Lay, said Enron ""management"" didn't take ""seriously enough"" the concerns of Enron Vice President Sherron Watkins, who sent Lay a memo last August warning that Enron would ""implode in a wave of accounting scandals."" And Kopper, who reported to Fastow, entered into a deal that turned a minimum investment into a $10 million windfall ""surreptitiously,"" without approval of Enron's board, Powers said. Skilling, whose surprise resignation last August spurred the Watkins memo, was aware of Kopper's involvement, Powers said. Skilling may have verbally approved the investment, but he didn't formally sign off on it, he said. Causey, Buy and Skilling were supposed to review Fastow's involvement in the partnerships and approve them as arms-length transactions, rather than sweetheart deals, Powers said. ""The controls were not followed,"" he said. ""Mr. Fastow wasn't in a position to mind the store, because he was personally involved in these transactions,"" Powers said, noting Fastow received ""very substantial income from these investments"" of at least $30 million.",0.9,0.5,0.9,0.8

Subject:	Career Opportunities at Enron



Dear Mr. Derrick:

     Les LoBaugh suggested that I contact you to inquire about an in-house
counsel position at Enron. I am the General Counsel of Niagara Mohawk Holding's
unregulated subsidiaries, Niagara Mohawk Energy, Inc. and Niagara Mohawk Energy
Marketing, Inc. We expect the sale of Niagara Mohawk Energy Marketing to close
in November or December of this year, pending FERC approval, and a sale of
Niagara Mohawk Energy's Distributed Power and Energy Services Business units may
occur contemporaneously with that closing. Therefore, I am now pursuing other
career opportunities.

     I am a good candidate for an in-house counsel position at Enron because of
my 12 years experience as an attorney in the energy industry. As General Counsel
for the Company, I provide legal services and business advise to senior
management and the Board of Directors of both the energy marketing and the
energy services subsidiaries. My experience includes drafting and negotiating
gas and electric retail sales agreements and master agreements and related
documents for wholesale energy trading and marketing transactions, including
physical transactions and financial instruments such as swaps. I monitor and I
am responsible for representing my company in FERC and state regulatory
proceedings. I keep up to date on the fast moving events and trends in the
energy marketing and trading industry by closely monitoring regulatory
proceedings, reading information that is published in trade and related energy
industry publications and my involvement with the National Energy Marketers
Association and the Federal Energy Bar Association. I am also responsible for
representing the company and managing outside counsel in litigation and
alternative dispute resolution proceedings. My experience includes utility
regulatory and legal matters, the transactional work associated with corporate
mergers and acquisitions, corporate governance, human resource/employee issues,
interconnection agreements, municipal law, leasing, financing and secured
transaction agreements, commercial contracts, condemnation litigation and real
property matters.

     I have attached my resume for your review. Please contact me at your
earliest convenience to schedule an interview. I look forward to hearing from
you soon.

     Thank you for your consideration.

Where there was an active market, as with stocks =or publicly traded bonds, that is relatively easy to do and difficult to ma=nipulate. But where there is no such market, companies were allowed by the =rules to use their own models to estimate fair value, and to treat that as =the market value.=20The mark-to-market technique was used to report profits in some Enron busin=esses. When its energy services unit signed a power-supply contract with a =company, it would structure the deal to bring it under those accounting rul=es. It would then project electricity and natural gas prices for the full t=erm of the deal, which could last as long as 10 years, according to former =Enron officials.=20Many of the contracts covered companies in states that had not yet deregula=ted their power markets. In those cases, Enron forecast when the states wou=ld deregulate those markets and then projected what prices would be under t=he currently nonexistent deregulated market.=20Then, based on its projections, Enron would calculate its total profit over= the life of the contract. After discounting that figure to account for the= risk its customer would default and the fact that it would not receive mos=t payments for years, Enron would book the profit immediately.=20Mr. Lucas said it had not occurred to him that anyone would use models to t=ry to forecast energy prices for 10 years, and then use those models to rep=ort profits, but that the rule had not placed a limit on such trades. He no=ted that any trade that required assumptions for such a long time would app=ear to be very risky.=20A former Enron official has told associates that Arthur Andersen, Enron's a=uditor, took a number of issues related to Enron's accounting to the task f=orce. That official said Andersen accountants viewed the company's structur=ing of financial instruments to be on the cutting edge.=20Andersen has a seat on the task force, as do each of the four other large a=ccounting firms. The other members among the 13 on the task force are 4 rep=resentatives of smaller accounting firms and 4 executives from large compan=ies. One industry seat is now vacant, after an executive from General Elect=ric left. The others are held by officials of J. P. Morgan, Exxon Mobil and= Dow Chemical.=20The task force does not disclose who suggests topics, so it is not possible= to be certain which Enron issues were considered. But it appears that one =such issue came in 2000, when the task force addressed the question of what= should be done about what appeared to be the application of widely varying=",0.8,1.0,0.7,0.6
raptor creation of special purpose entities,0,"Subject: Project Raptor - Private Hedge CandidatesIt has come to my attention that questions have been raised in reviewing the Raptor I Derivative Proposal Sheets regarding the type of information that should be set forth in the category entitled ""ASSET DESCRIPTION"". The Master Derivatives Agreement (""MDA"") requires that the Proposal Sheets describe the ""Assets"" with respect to which the derivative transaction is to be executed. For purposes of the MDA, ""Assets"" is defined as ""assets, including without limitation common stock, partnership interests, member interests. other ownership interests, and other financial and physical assets."" Therefore, the description should include both the nature of the ""Asset"" (i.e. whether it is an equity interest, a loan, working interest, etc.) and a little bit about the company (the entity in which ENA holds the interest or has the loan or working interest).Any comments to the Proposal Sheets should be delivered ASAP to the ""Enron person completing this form"" (This is the 3rd line under the heading ""GENERAL"" on each of the Proposal Sheets) along with a request that a revised Proposal Sheet be returned to the lawyer providing comments with copies to both Mary Cook and Lisa Mellencamp. The pressure to complete these Raptor hedges remains high and therefore your immediate attention is greatly appreciated. Many thanks.Stuart",0.0,0.0,0.7,0.2

	tee 7.16-19.01

Ken,

Houston's bid for the 2012 Olympic Games is entering the final phase of the
domestic bid process.  This summer, the United States Olympic Committee
(USOC) will conduct initial site visits and evaluations of the eight U.S.
bid cities with the goal being to cut the number of cities to three or four.
This cut will occur in December of this year.  The USOC will be conducting
Houston's site visit July 16-19, 2001.

This site visit is critical to our ultimate success in bringing the Olympic
Games to Houston.  Over the four-day period in which the USOC site
evaluation team is in Houston, two days will be devoted to venue tours and
presentations.  There are eight presentation topics predetermined by the
USOC, one of which is International Strategy. Simply stated, this is where
we show why we think Houston can win on the international level.

As a Port Commissioner and a board member of Houston 2012, I will be part of
the team that presents this section to the USOC site evaluation team.  As
arguably the most identifiable international corporate leader in Houston and
as the Chairman of the 1990 Economic Summit and the 1992 Republican National
Convention, both of which you left with a positive surplus (very important
to the Olympics), you are in an excellent position to discuss Houston's
international status.

George DeMontrond, Susan Bandy (the Houston 2012 Exec Director) and I would
very much appreciate 15 minutes or so of your time to update you on
Houston's bid efforts and discuss your potential participation in the
upcoming site visit. You are our first and only choice, and I'd like the
opportunity to show you how important this is for Houston. We expect the
number of U.S. bid cities to be reduced to four finalists by this December
as a result of these meetings.  I will call Rosalee to schedule a time for a
visit at your offices. All the best and I look forward to catching up with
you soon. I'm attaching my bio, which details the last few years of activity
I've been involved with, most of which emanated from your support for me on
the UH Board of Regents, the 1990 Economic Summit Host Committee, the 1992
RNC Convention and later the GHP. Thank you for everything you've done for
Sarah and me -- hopefully I've reciprocated by doing a good job for you each
time.

The planshave been drawn up by the Joint Working Group, a body made up mainly ofaccounting standard-setters from the world's biggest economies. Bankers saythe results would lead to dramatic swings in the value of balance sheetassets that would often be meaningless and potentially damaging.It is certainly the case that the existing accounting rules often fail toreflect the impact of changes in interest rates or credit risks on bankearnings. Fair value accounting would force banks to adjust their accountsin the light of rises and falls in the values of all financial instruments.The result would be greater volatility in profits but proponents of thechange say it would give investors a truer picture of corporate health.Not so, say the banks. While fair value accounting is appropriate fortrading activities, it would not reflect the real business of makinglong-term loans to customers, which are largely held to maturity andtherefore rarely traded.

How would the generator run if the PMT breaker tripped? Normally, CB1 will 
trip for undervolatge due to lose of power.

Subject: Re: Zilkha Availability  

To cut to the chase....would CB1 fault the turbine when the PMT breaker 
tripped and if so then would the downtime or line out time availability hour 
counter be incremented?    If the PMT breaker trip doesn't always cause a 
given fault then is there any easy way (SCADA data or site crew experience) 
for us to estimate what percentage of the trips did fault the turbine 
offlline due to a downtime or line out fault?  Please answer these 
questions;  we will then know what corrections, if any, we need to make to 
availability.

Joe,
Lets not forget that we had measure problems due to failing MS3 relay in the 
SEG converter, which caused the crow bar to engage, which in turn forced CB1 
to fault.

CB1 is designed to do both synchronization and was set to protect the turbine 
and the converter in a fault condition. The original instantaneous settings 
of 8000A was too high and allowed too much current through the system that 
damaged the converter and caused IGBTs to blow before it tripped. The second 
failure was due to a QA issue with failing CB1 to trip when it was commanded 
to by the converter. In both events we had catastrophic failures and lost 2 
converters due to CB1 failing to protect the system. To remedy this problem, 
we installed the PMT for CB1 redundancy and decreased the instantaneous 
setting from 8000A to 3000A and since then we didn't have any IGBT blow ups 
or any catastrophic failures

Even though that I am still not clear about Gary's question at the end, I 
hope that the above provide some help.


Thank you,

Tim M

Kurt,
 Per our phone conversation, Mark Fisher and myself have been discussing 
availability with Gary from Zilkha. A question arose regarding the many 
operations of our breaker in the pad mounted transformer that took place 
December through March. Gary's thought is that when we recalculate the 
availability, we need to count these times as down time and not Line Out 
Hours as they have currently been counted. I suggested that according to

Assemblywoman Corbett will likely propose  amendments at Monday's Rev & Tax 
Cmte hearing on her AB 128x. Apparently,  the amendments will require that 
the PUC set a ""fair price"" for  electricity.? Any charges above that fair 
price?will be subject to the  proposed excess profits tax.
Also of interest is that the excess profits tax  would attempt to apply to 
out-of-state companies that sell energy into  California.? They are going to 
try to impute nexus to the out-of-state  generators by arguing that they are 
deriving economic benefit from selling into  California and that creates 
nexus.
Finally, it appears that the Suspense File will not  be invoked in this case 
because that policy only applies to Regular Session  bills. Obviously, AB

Dear Trader,

Have you ever wondered what's the difference between a successful
commodities trader and a non-successful trader? The answer is not that
difficult, it's knowledge! Knowledge can be obtained several different ways.
One way, is the ""school of hard knocks"" which many people have honorary
degrees but no money.(I've been there, in case you are wondering) Another
way, a better way, is to find someone who knows how to trade and have that
person teach you. This is certainly a better, and less costly, choice.

My name is David Duty and I started trading over five years ago after I got
a brochure in the mail about trading commodities. It seemed interesting and
I got pretty excited about the possibilities. I ordered a course that
promised everything, but delivered almost nothing. I lost $10,000 in less
than 90 days, not to mention the $5,000 I threw away on these courses. I

RANDOM,0,"cation by the utilities for another
attempt to reinstitute the RLS tariff or an onerous peaking rate.  The
Commission will impose a premium price on service to customers who have not
undertaken the firm 5 year commitment and will therefore be unable to
economically take partial requirements service from an interstate.  My view
is based on Sempra's reaction to the current peaking rate proposed decision
and statements by Lynch's office.  This could interfere with Enron gas sales
over the interstates, and would certainly threaten any Transwestern plans
for building across the border into California, although that does not
appear to be a high priority at this time.  This bill will also make it more
costly to develop gas supply arrangments for new power plants which had
hoped to direct connect to interstate pipeline capacity for a portion of
their needs.

Please call if you have further questions.  Mike Day

Subject: Re: AB 23XX Bad Bill Alert



I've taken a quick look at the bill and have attached for easy viewing.
Few questions.

Mike,
   I understand from our conversation yesterday that your following this on
   behalf of Questar.  Do we know if the other pipelines have been active
   in any discussions on this bill?
   What about the generators?  Have then been involved, since presumably,
   their in need of lots more capacity (and they're referenced in the
   bill)?
   What about large customers?  They been screaming for more
   infrastructure, too, and many have blamed SoCalGas (and the PUC) for not
   delivering it.
   Do we know if pipelines, generators, large customers are supporting or
   opposing the bill?  I'll try to check around, too, in between the
   electric mayhem.
   There doesn't seem to be anything in the bill that prevents the
   interstates from building into the state.
   If that's true, wouldn't the PUC take those projects into account when
   doing its analysis and only require the utility to construct (and
   noncore to take) capacity that isn't already being met by others (i.e.,
   interstates) bringing pipe into the state?

Any info you can provide on these fronts would be very useful.  Don't want
Enron too far out in front of opposition until we find out a bit more
regarding 1) whose fer and agin it and 2) analysis of what the bill
actually does/does not do.

Thanks again for the heads up.

Best,
Jeff

I can not understand how an HR employee for an Enron business unit can deny access to what appears to be an Enron auditor on the grounds that the records being sought are confidential. As you know Sanjay reports to both Ken and myself in support of EBS Asia activities as well as I believe McDonald for Global Assets. Given this split accountability, and the fact that I do not know which business unit these records apply to, you as a representative of Corp should probably require that Enron be given access to these records as part of your audit responsibilities.

An Internal Controls Review entails reviewing not only financial areas but other departments such as legal, IT, operations, etc. We started our testing late last week and were informed that supporting documentation for certain accounting transactions reside in HR. We then scheduled a meeting with the head of HR, Sandip Malik, to request supporting documentation for the transactions and other information that is more relevant to HR as part of our Controls Review. Mr. Malik denied access to the records on the basis that they are confidential. Apparently, not even the Controller has access to some of the supporting documentation. Mr. Malik stated that we needed to give him a request list, so he could clear it with Sanjay Bhatnagar. We informed him that we could not give him a list but needed general access because we did not want to go back and forth with lists given my limited time here in India and logistical difficulties in communicating with Mr. Bhatnager.

RANDOM,0,"Subject: [Footballguys] Update - Bettis Considering Sitting Last Two Regular
 Games

Entire story:
ml


From the Jerry DiPaola article:   Steelers running back Jerome Bettis missed
practice Wednesday, and later said he might not need to play in the final
two regular-season games to be ready for the first playoff game Jan. 19 or
20.

Bettis has missed the past three games with a serious groin injury that he
described to David Letterman last week as ""like splitting your pants, but
you're splitting your body.""

""Do you need to (play)? Need is a strong word,"" Bettis said yesterday after
watching his teammates practice. ""Would you like to get a little work in?
Just a little bit, nothing strenuous. But you would like to get a little
work in if you could.

""But if you can't, I don't think it precludes you from playing (in the
playoffs).""

Bettis said that he didn't know if he would practice today or play Sunday in
Cincinnati, but he will base his availability on how he feels.

""You want to take care of the injury first and if that means not playing,
that means not playing,"" he said. ""But you want to make sure you're healed
up. The team playing as well as it has played allows me the opportunity to
get healthy. I'm using it very, very wisely.

""What I do know is if you don't play, there is going to be a certain amount
of rust associated with not having played. The key is to minimize the rust.
This is nine years in. I'm not going to miss much.""

************  Our View  ****************

Pretty much sums it up right there.   Clearly, Bettis is a large risk here.
Stay tuned to see how he progresses but even if he were to start, there's
always that very real risk that he'd pull himself out if he felt a twinge.

Thanks to Footballguy Greg Lizotte for pointing me to this one.

     Taiwan's economics ministry has announced the full opening of 
the oil market to foreign-refined products, heaping pressure on state-
run giant Chinese Petroleum Corp to speed up deregulation. The 
privatization of Taiwan's oil products came after passage of the oil 
management law in September, which would open the floodgates to 
imports of gasoline, diesel and kerosene, and expand the island 
nation's already crowded energy market. After the opening, any 
company, which has facilities to store 60 days of reserves or 50 
million liters of the oil products, is allowed to buy them from 
foreign refiners, said the Energy Commission. In 1999, the government 
cut restrictions on imports of jet fuel, fuel oil and LPG as part of 
its drive to meet requirements for entry into the WTO. The complete 
deregulation was set to further erode market share of dominant 
supplier CPC. CPC, faced with a saturated domestic market and 
increasing competition, will have to accelerate its privatization or 
see a further erosion of dominance in the local oil market. CPC says 
it plans to sell as much as a 50% stake overseas in the second half 
of 2002.

If this is the template, I would like to understand how the ""ENA as agent for E-Next"" language is going to be inserted and what exactly the language will say. With respect to the Agreement in Principle for the turbine for the Longview project, the contract states that this template along with Pastoria Assignment and Assumption language and override letters will be the basis for the final turbine purchase agreeement. Given that the Pastoria turbine contracts had the financing vehicle on the contract as purchaser, with ENA as its agent, I'm unclear how the circulated template contract is supposed to read for the Longview project and every other turbine purchase contract which is being financed by E-Next Generation LLC.I have noted in the template contract sections which need to be ""agentized"", including the preamble where the question is asked if ENA will always be the purchaser - no is the answer for Longview and probably most of the contracts ENA wants to enter into with GE. I will not make those comments here until I receive your response to the above.2. First Recital: Given that the Facility is defined for a specific project, I didn't read anywhere that ENA has the flexibility to use this turbine in other projects if it so chooses. Please advise where I can find this flexibility to change venue language.3. Second Recital: Where is ""GTG"" defined?4.

RANDOM,0,"n the attached statement 
of principles regarding Security and Human Rights that Enron Corp is 
considering endorsing. These have been worked out over the past several 
months by a task force of the US and UK governments, along with 
representatives of industry (including Enron) and NGOs (including Amesty and 
Human Rights Watch) under the auspices of Secretary fo State Albright and 
Foreign Secretary Cook.  As a result, we really don't  have the ability to 
change the text, which is fixed. 

As you know, Enron is very concerned about human rights issues because of 
their intrinsic value and their community relations impacts.These guidelines 
would be in addition to the Human Rights Policy Statement the Enron board 
adopted last year, which really do not touch on security matters as such. I 
have sent this to each of your since your business units are those that have 
the most extensive operations in the developing countries in which these 
issues are of primary concern.  (I am separately collecting comments/concerns 
from within EES and EECC.)

The Enron effort on this guideline project has been lead by Lauren Goldblatt 
of the Corp. PR group. Lauren has run the attached drafts past Mike Hicks and 
Pete Vandergam at Corp. Security for their views of whether this can be 
implemented by Enron.  We as the legal department have been asked to express 
our view on are the following:

(a) Are there any show stoppers that would argue that Enron should not 
publicly express its ""endorsement"" of these polices?
(b) If Enron were to express its endorsement of the policy statement, what if 
any material problems do you think your business line might encounter in 
implementing the policy?
(c) Do you see any unintended practical or legal consequences that might 
arise from Enron publicly adopting or endorsing this as policy?

Please take an hour few hours to read through the materials, or have one of 
your lawyers do so. You might need to consult with your operation personnel 
for their practical views as well.   I would be grateful if you could express 
any concerns you may see with the guidelines by November 7 (Wednesday) so 
that I can coordinate comments and get the responses out.   (The deadline for 
Enron and other companies to express their endorsement of the policy has been 
extended from the November 8 deadline expressed in the attached to November 
15. To allow time for Enron to deal with responses, we have been asked to get

RANDOM,0,"Canadian to Spend C$1.7 Billion This Year


    PanCanadian Energy plans to spend C$1.7 billion in 2002 to increase
both its natural gas production and proven oil reserves by 10%. About 70%
of the expenditures will be directed at natural gas projects with C$430
million spent on prospects in Canada's East Coast offshore region, the
deepwater Gulf of Mexico and the North Sea. PanCanadian plans to drill
1,800 wells this year, down from about 2,150 in 2001. Last had major
offshore and international exploration successes, with preliminary results
showing that it replaced about 170% of production. Oil production is
expected to decline by 5% year over year, although phase one work on the
Christina Lake oil sands project will be completed early this year, and
has the potential to add significant reserves and production in the medium
term. PanCanadian also is evaluating production options with its partners
at its Buzzard oil project in the North Sea. PanCanadian's share of the
discovery is more than 180 million barrels of recoverable crude oil.

This reconciliation is necessary to validate the transfer of all data from source systems, i.e. risk books, into risk applications which calculate VAR, provide credit exposures, feed Infinity with daily cash flows and ultimately the DPR. Sally and Beth, along with IT, have initiated a project to improve and monitor the accuracy and efficiency of these daily interfaces. The scope includes a review of the processes which impact the accuracy of information, timing of interfaces, production performance issues, inventory of books and improved controls over changes to book attributes, and the officialization process. They have agreed to add a requirement to provide, on a daily basis, this reconciliation across all major risk applications.The projected timeline to complete this project, including the reconciliation initiative, is 60 to 90 days. We will need to reassess the decision to combine these initiatives, if the GRMO timeline slips.  This daily risk applications reconciliation will provide four key metrics not currently available:1) the ability to track data ""accuracy"" in terms of the percentage of information which transferred and processed correctly, vs. just unique ""failures"". How complete is the data? 2) the ability to validate the accuracy of exception reporting (are all failures included on the exception reports?)3) the ability to validate Infinity cash flows4) Reconciliation of values (volumes, PRMA &PRML and cash flows), not # of books processed.Please call me if you would like to discuss.

Subject: Talking Points re ""reregulation"" in California

As I promised this morning at the executive committee meeting, below are some 
talking points for your use.

Overall message:  the market is working, regulation is not.

In California, peak demand rose by 10% over the last 4 years while new 
capacity grew by only 2%.  But, as you would expect, the market responded by 
proposing 8,000MW of new generation - - more than enough to offset the peak 
demand growth.  The regulatory process, at both the state and local level, 
has failed to site this new generation.  The problem is regulation, not 
deregulation.

When San Diego customers began experiencing the effects of higher prices, 
Enron responded with a fixed price which would have shielded San Diego 
customers from price volatility and provided prices below their current 
summer levels (Enron's price was about $55/MWH).  After publication of 
Enron's offer, nine other companies made offers.  Again, the market responded 
where regulation failed.  San Diego has not accepted any of these offers 
because of regulatory/legislative restrictions on its ability to buy outside 
of the PX (i.e. the spot market).

In markets where siting is easier, suppliers have moved to build additional 
generation.  Enron built 3 plants in response to the 1998 price spikes.  
Those plants were planned, sited and built in less that 12 months - - in time 
for the summer of 1999.  Where regulatory hurdles are lower, the market 
responds.

The solution to current pricing and reliability issues is more competition 
not reregulation.  Policy makers should:

Open the transmission grid so that power can get from where it is to where it 
is needed.

Expedite interconnection of new generation.

Expedite siting of new facilities.

Give customers a choice, so that they have better access to demand side 
solutions.


Also attached is a more detailed discussion of California, prepared by Jeff 
Dasovich of our San Francisco office.

I'm not sure what a traunch is but according to Mick Walters this deal has 
been in evergreen and this deal is a firming up (renegotiating) of the 
contract.  That said, it is basically a new deal to us.  We have newly marked 
volumes.

Sandi,

The deal David is referencing relates to an unbooked traunch under contract 
96001783.   This traunch had not previously been booked because the contract 
had had a price re-opening provision.  I'm fairly certain contract 96001783

Subject: New deals on HPL

On Friday, Nov 10, we had a new long term deal entered under HPL.  It was a 
wellhead deal with Conoco at four different meters.  It was priced at 94% of 
HSC index.  The value on the deal was $1,097,210.  Logically, this would 
increase our recoverable cost from $193 mil to $194 mil.  I will send you 
notes periodically on new long term deals that increase our unwind costs.

RANDOM,0,"Subject: Procedure for adding new Capacity tickets for multi-desk Service
 utilization - revised

Revision in bold.  Pass on to any who may need this.

In order to provide the ability to track transport expense by Desk, Sitara 
was modified to allow multiple Transport Capacity tickets for the same 
Service Contract provided that they are for different desks and only one is 
tagged as ""Primary"".  Here is the procedure for setting up new Capacity 
tickets to reflect the ""other"" desks:

a.  You will probably first notice this via a warning/error message in Path 
Manager when building a new path.  The message will read something like   
""Source/Destination 123456 for desk IMCT does not match Service contract 3434 
and will be removed.""
b.  Make note of the deal number in the Service List of the Service contract 
that you were using in the new path.
c.  Open that Transport Capacity deal in Sitara.  Then hit Copy.
d.  On the new deal:
 Change the Buyer from the old desk to the new desk that matches the Supply 
or Market deal that you are pathing with.  If it a deal for which we are 
  agent, then don't change the Buyer but instead change the Agent to the new 
desk.  The ""primary"" deal will carry the actual Agent.  The Agent
  contract will get cleared.  Re-select the Agent Contract.
 Changing the Buyer causes the Contract field to get blanked out.  Re-select 
the Pipeline contract.
 Just above the various exchange line items is a Primary Deal check box.  
Un-check it.
 On each exchange line item, change the MDQ to zero and for any Negotiated 
rates, uncheck them as well.  The ""primary"" deal will carry the MDQ and
  any negotiated Demand, Commodity or fuel.
 Hit Release.
e.  You may need to re-retrieve Path Manager.  You should see the Deal number 
in the Service list now read ""Multiple"".  Right-click/Service Deals will list 
the  specific deals.
f.  Re-build the path as you originally desired.  The warning/error message 
should not appear again.

This could occur for any combination of Desk and Service Contract.
Please file this in your ""Call Dave If I Can't Find This"" folder.

For instance, this would include the traditional Accounting/Reporting departments, Tax departments, and Transaction Support departments. It should NOT include any settlements/mid-office groups (for example, Sally Beck's world).

Hopefully, I can get this as of July 31/August 1. If you have more recent data, that would be great. At a bare minimum, I need total headcount as described by group (acct, reporting, tax, etc.) It would also be useful to get as much detail as possible, i.e. by sub-group, by personnel level, etc., but I know that may be a challenge given the timing of the request. Additionally, if you can provide me with a ""current estimate"" for the groups you report, that would be ideal. I know that the official CE doesn't go to that level, but I'm betting that most of you have something that projects your G&A by cost center (or group/dept) for 2001, as of the 2nd CE.The headcount information is a must have, and the 2001 cost estimate is secondary, although I'd like to ask everyone to strive to provide both.

Efficient and Effective Collection of Data,GX01-2  [Item G-22]

Chairman Wood called this item for discussion in response to queries from the American Public Gas Association (APGA) about what actual market data is generally available for the natural gas industry.  This issue came out in part due to the AGA storage data error that occurred a month or so ago.  APGA suggests the following information be available:
1.	Production
2.	Production capability (and resulting utilization rate based on #1 and #2)
3.	Pipeline capacity
4.	Operational capacity (and resulting utilization rate based on #3 and #4)
5.	End-use by customer class

Because of the AGA ""hiccup"" on its data storage numbers, Chairman Wood would like to see more than one data source for important market information (though it may not be FERC's job to collect such data). Commissioner Brownell suggested the establishment of a stakeholder group to determine what kind of information is needed, if any information is collected and not used, and how collected information will serve the market.  Staff noted that several information collection items are being developed for the 2002 FERC Business Plan, and the APGA list may be incorporated into that effort. 

East Tennessee Expansion for new generation, CP01-80  [Item C-1]

This case, in which an East Tennessee expansion to serve a new generation load is approved, was called by Chairman Wood in response to a specific issue raised by APGA.  APGA is concerned that the ""proliferation of pipeline projects"" to serve generation are being approved without consideration of the resultant impact on the nation's gas customers - that impact being the exacerbation of natural gas prices across the board.  Chairman Wood said he wanted to clarify publicly that, as stated in the order, it is not FERC's job to decide ""why any person needs gas?.the public is best served when the market dictates"" price and supply.  He pointed out that the Commission's certificate policy is very direct and clear on risk, and he is comfortable with that state of affairs.

Generation Interconnection, EX01-5  [Item E-1]

The Commission agreed to establish a Straw Man model (probably using the ERCOT model) to modify generation interconnection procedures, service agreements and rights. This process will precede a NOPR that will establish interconnection standards to alleviate complaints, constrictions and delays in processes.

it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,1,"YOU'D be better informed if, instead of listening to what we say, you watch what we do.'' That excellent advice was not issued by Enron management, although it should have been. Instead it came more than 30 years ago from John N. Mitchell, President Richard M. Nixon's attorney general.Enron's restatement of earnings yesterday did not go far enough to allow investors to understand all of what went on during the company's many strange transactions with related parties. It is now consolidating the results of some of its off-balance-sheet creations, though what happened in the most important ones remains a mystery. But the restatement should, at the least, cause investors and Wall Street analysts to realize they have been fooled by so-called pro forma earnings, which leave out unpleasant realities and ignore accounting rules. In January, Enron told investors its ''recurring net income,'' as it calls its pro forma number, would be $1.70 to $1.75 a share this year. The company's share price rose to $82 when that forecast was made. Remarkably, Enron is still on course to hit that target. Yesterday's restatement raised its nine-month earnings figure by a penny, to $1.36. And yet Enron appears to be willing to sell out for about $10 a share, or less than six times its reported profits, which still appear to be growing. Why so little? The answer may be that Enron's board knows those numbers are not reliable measures of performance. Enron's failure to disclose more about the still unconsolidated subsidiaries is an indication that the unreleased facts would not be reassuring. And Enron cannot stay in business unless customers and investors believe it is financially solid. So it is willing to sell out for a fraction of what it appeared to be worth only weeks ago. Don't call it a takeover. Takeunder would be a better term. What set off Enron's collapse? It now appears to have been a mistake. Enron says it added $1 billion to shareholder equity in 2000 and early this year in error. The mistake did nothing to improve Enron's profits at the time, so it seems unlikely it was deliberate. Had the mistake not been made, the reduction in shareholder equity it disclosed last month would have been $200 million, not $1.2 billion. That reduction scared investors into believing that Enron's transactions with partnerships led by Andrew Fastow, its former chief financial officer, had been disastrous for the company. Now it appears they may not have been so bad. But that fact is not very important now. Enron's new disclosures indicate that perhaps 40 percent of its reported profits in 2000 came from dealings with the Fastow partnerships. Such profits may be legal under accounting rules, but there are good reasons to doubt how real they are.",0.5,0.6,0.8,0.6

We'll need the full legal name of the issuer of the equity interest, a full legal description of the equity interest (common stock, preferred stock, warrants, etc.), the number of the certificate (if any) representing the interest and the number of shares or warrants being hedged.I understand that the hedge will be structured as a price return swap and the initial equity notional amount of the swap will be based on the book value of the equity interest. It would be helpful to see the latest financial statements showing that book value.We will also need to investigate whether any contractual or other legal restrictions may affect our ability to enter into these hedges.This is an initial list that I've prepared very quickly.

Pamela Hughes, spokeswoman for the Galveston Association of Realtors, said they could still be for sale. She said sellers sometimes ask that listings not be published and that for-sale signs not be placed in front of properties while sales are negotiated privately. 
Three of the Lays' properties in Aspen are listed, and the sale of a fourth in the winter playground is being negotiated privately, said broker Joshua Saslove. 
A five-bedroom home and a four-bedroom home in Aspen were each initially listed for $6.5 million, but the five-bedroom has been reduced to $6.15 million and the smaller dwelling is on the market for $6.125 million, Saslove said. An undeveloped lot is listed for $2.95 million. 
The Lays' smallest Aspen home, a three-bedroom cottage valued at $4.1 million, is also for sale, but less conspicuously. 
""We are negotiating privately with an individual to acquire it,"" Saslove said of the smaller home. ""It is under contract."" 
Filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission show Lay received about $8.3 million in salary and bonuses from Enron in 2000. Other records show he sold 1.8 million shares of Enron stock for $101 million from October 1998 through November of last year. 
His lawyer, Earl Silbert, did not return a call for comment on the sale of Lay's real estate holdings. Silbert said last month that Lay sold millions of dollars in stock because he needed cash to repay loans, not out of concern over the company's health. 
Silbert said Lay put up stock as collateral for other investments. At least 15 times from February to October last year, Lay returned Enron shares to the company to repay $4 million he had received through a credit line. 
Records show that through December, when Lay resigned from the boards of Compaq Computer Corp. and Eli Lilly & Co., he directly owned $6.7 million in stock in those companies. After his resignations from the boards, he was no longer required to disclose his holdings in those companies. 
His Enron stock, valued at $1.1 million through December, was worth less than the beachfront properties. Lay resigned as chairman and chief executive of Enron on Jan. 23 but remains on the board. 
The Lays do not have to worry about losing their penthouse. Texas law guarantees that debtors can keep a primary residence while in bankruptcy, whether it is or a one-room efficiency apartment or a multimillion-",0.0,0.0,0.7,0.0

(I am the OxyChem rep).  Two years ago, OxyChem tried very hard to get HPL to

We should seriously question why HPL should pay for the relocation of the NGO 
line as referenced in the report attached.  Entex gets the full benefit of 
this customer and probably should fund this project.  If they won't, then 
maybe we should pursue this customer direct while we are in the progress of 
replacing the pipeline.  We probably also have franchise related issues with 
the City of Baytown on this.  Tom, please determine what course of action we 
need to take from a franchise perspective.  Then call a meeting of the above

mark to market accounting practices,0,"CHICAGO, Jan. 2 /PRNewswire/ -- Andersen today announced that its system of accounting and auditing quality has been deemed to provide reasonable assurance of compliance with professional standards, following the most extensive peer review in the firm's history. Deloitte & Touche's report, which includes an unmodified opinion for the review year ended August 31, 2001, has been accepted by the Peer Review Committee of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' (AICPA) SEC Practice and is available at the AICPA, http://www.aicpa.org/members/div/secps/index.htm . Every three years since 1978, major accounting firms, under the oversight of the Public Oversight Board (POB), have been engaged to conduct reviews of the accounting and auditing practices of member firms in the AICPA SEC Practice Section (SECPS). The scope of this year's peer review of Andersen was expanded after financial reporting issues emerged at Enron Corp. Andersen requested, and Deloitte & Touche had separately concluded, that expanded procedures were appropriate. Deloitte & Touche independently determined the scope of the expanded peer review procedures.In total, the peer and Andersen's internal practice review covered 240 Andersen audit engagements in over 30 Andersen offices and the Andersen national office. The engagements reviewed by Deloitte & Touche reviewers and Andersen practice review teams involved some 45 percent of Andersen's U.S. audit partners. The engagements selected for review represented a cross-section of Andersen's accounting and auditing practice with emphasis on higher-risk engagements. It included examining working paper files and reports and interviewing engagement personnel. Deloitte & Touche's opinion was ""unmodified,"" without qualification. However, three issues not deemed significant enough to affect the opinion were raised in an attached comment letter. Such comments are not unusual in peer review reports. The comments related to: documentation of certain auditing procedures on some engagements; communications with audit committees in some instances; and management representation letters that needed more tailoring in some instances. In its response to Deloitte & Touche's comments, Andersen said it had taken, or would take, the steps recommended to improve its accounting and auditing practices. About Andersen",0.0,0.0,0.5,0.2

Traders only run the deal checkout report to see that the trade is entered into the system as transacted and then mark the trade with a ""C"" so that Accounting knows that the deal is OK and then Accounting can print a confirm from the system to send out.3) Under ""Risk Assessment and Control (ETS RAC), 6th Bullet, yes the bullet is appropriate.

This was discussed as a potential option to ease the administrative burden on Accounting. A final decision has not yet been reached.

RANDOM,0,"Subject: Re: Siting Committee Hearing - Interconnection Rules

I will most likely not be able to attend.  However, my comment relating to 
this issue was a generalization of confidentiality clauses I've used on other 
interconnect agreements and other contracts, including the ""model"" 
interconnection agreement recently submitted to FERC by EPSA.  In essence, 
the issue is that the utility should not have the unilateral right to 
disclose any information to anyone they want that is sent to them in 
connection with a DG interconnection.  This would include ownership, facility 
output, markets for energy or capacity or ancillary sevices (if any) and 
maintenance schedules (these schedules may be coincident with a retail 
customer's facility maintenance schedule which itself may be confidential 
information between the generator and retail customer).  This information is 
potentially competitive and should be held confidential.  Potential wording 
for a simplified confidentiality section would be as follows:

""Unless compelled to disclose by judicial or administrative process or other 
provisions of law or as otherwise provided for in this Rule, the Electic 
Provider shall hold in confidence any and all documents and information 
furnished by the Electric Customer in connection with the interconnection, 
provide however, that to the extent it is necessary for the the EP to release 
or disclose such information to a third party in order to perform the EP's 
obligation herein, EP shall advise said third party of the confidential 
provisons of this Rule and use its best efforts to require said third party 
to agree in writing to comply with such provisions.""

it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,1,"While many businesses used what was known in the industry as ""mark-to-marke=t accounting,"" for instance, Enron used it on an unprecedented scale.

and a share of future profits, the rest of the company's assets are being
sold off to pay creditors a small portion of over $40 billion that they
are owed. Although company officials have said they are committed to
keeping the core intact, it is slowly being dismembered and there may be
little left to reorganize. Enron claimed assets of more than $50 billion
in its bankruptcy filing, but they may actually bring much less when sold.
The commodity trades and derivative contracts that Enron entered into
before filing for bankruptcy were estimated to be worth up to $8 billion
last month, but now it says the about 700 open position are worth about
$1.3 billion. It is seeking court permission to settle the contracts to
raise cash. Since it collapsed, Enron has sold about $520 million of
contracts and assets and lost control of its $2.7 billion Northern Natural
Gas Pipeline, but is contesting Dynegy's rights to the pipeline. As part
of its plans to emerge from bankruptcy, Enron wants to place litigation
against it in a trust and raise between $4 - $6 billion by selling assets
in Latin America and Asia. Centrica Plc has agreed to buy Enron's UK
energy supply business for $137.1 million and Kinder Morgan plans to buy
Enron's share in a natural gas pipeline for $68 million. AEP has purchased
wind generators in Texas from Enron for $175 million. Enron could also ask
the bankruptcy judge to allow the $2.98 billion sale of its Portland
General Electric utility to Northwest Natural Gas. It also hopes to sell
other businesses, including the Wessex water utility in Britain. Currently
Enron's most valuable asset is Transwestern Pipeline, which is worth about
$1.2 billion, and might get creditors $640 million after paying off about
$560 million in debt.

mark to market losses,1,"Bad trading. Enron's main technique to pump up earnings probably revolvedaround a loose-as-a-goose process for the accounting of energy derivatives.Called mark-to-market, the technique involves evaluating contracts at ""fairvalue"" prices. Since some of these contracts stretched out for 20 years, thefutures market provides no firm prices. And, absent a liquid market withclear prices, ""fair value"" becomes a mug's game in which companies canvastly inflate value. These overstated gains, of course, were also unrealized, noncash gains. InSeptember 2000, Jonathan Weil, a reporter for the Journal, took a look atEnron's second quarter and found that absent noncash earnings, Enron wouldhave had a loss. Mr. Weil later found that for the year as a whole,unrealized trading gains accounted for more than half of the company'soriginally reported pretax profits. Hardly a confidence-builder in thequality of Enron's earnings.When their derivative strategies started to go sour, this theory runs, Enronremoved the contracts from its financial statements and hid them in specialentities created for just that purpose.Bad Assets. Another theory locates Enron's earning problems in their hardassets. Enron had a bunch of huge and underperforming assets, like itsbroadband company, water company and power plants in India and Brazil. Inorder to hustle those assets and associated debts off its financial reports,the company created some limited partnerships to buy these dogs -- eitherwith bank loans or money provided by Enron itself. These partnerships(allegedly) transferred enough control to third parties to get them offEnron's balance sheet. Enron guaranteed these deals with ""make good"" provisions backed by Enronstock -- a promise that Enron would make good any losses in the value of thepartnerships. When the value of the assets tanked, the make-good provisionskicked in, resulting, for example, in the enormous write-down in shareholderequity in November.Depending on which theory one accepts, there are two bottom lines.The first holds that the sagging earnings problem was fatal and that it isentirely possible Enron was in the process of liquidating itself. Jim Chanosof Kynikos Associates hypothesizes that Enron's cost of capital was higherthan its returns on invested capital. A second argues that if Enron'smanagers had been content to accept the fact that in competitive marketstheir ""first mover"" advantage was going to be competed away, and had beenwilling to endure slower earnings growth, it would not be in bankruptcytoday.",1.0,0.8,0.9,0.8
it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,0,"The sudden collapse of Enron, until recently the nation's seventh-largest c=orporation, took investors by surprise.

The source of this information?

Subject: Re: Natural Gas Odorizers - Baytown feed to Entex

Too much missing information!  For what reason is Exxon installing a new pipe 
support structure across the San Jacinto Water Canal?  Is it in poor 
condition and needs to be replaced, thus mandating our need to move?  Is the 
Water Authority requiring the move and why?  Is the existing structure going 
to stay and is that acceptable to the Water Authority and Exxon?  Will Exxon 
allow us to remain in the same location even though they are building a new 
structure?  What is the condition of our pipe on the existing rack?  Don't we 
already have a permit with the Water Authority for the existing pipeline?  Is 
the Water Authority a City of Baytown organization and therefore falls within 
the City's control on franchise permits, fees, issues, etc?  

Once you have the answers to the above questions, then get us together so we 
can formulate a plan.  Lee, what is the existing term of their commitment to 
Entex?  Is Oxy OK with a short term shut down to get all this connected once 
in place or do they need continuing operations?  Due to the time constraints 
on replacement, we need quick answers.  Brad, you are on point to quickly 
pull this together.

He also said inflation remains tame. Contrary to money managers' impressions, Greenspan said consumers were still confident about the economy. He noted fallingenergy prices were boosting corporate profits and putting more money into consumers' pockets. Among Tuesday's highlights: * Oil stocks slumped after reporting quarterly results as investors bet this could be their last show of increased profits for some time as energy prices decline. Exxon Mobil, the No. 1 U.S. oil company and a component of the Dow industrials, posted higher earnings, thanks to lofty crude oil and natural gas prices and robust profit from refining. Exxon dropped $1.53 to $40.97. No. 2 oil company Chevron also slid, despite posting better earnings. Its shares fell $2.46 to $85.18. * Utility stocks fell sharply on expectations of lower power prices and falling profit margins. The Dow Jones utilities average lost 3.5% and is down nearly 10% during the last five trading sessions. Among the losers: Enron, down $3.42 to $43.24; Dynegy, off $2.75 to $43; Calpine, off $4.25 to $33.90; and Duke Energy, down $2.06 to $36.88. * Fast food giant McDonald's, another Dow component, gained 62 cents to $28.39 after reporting profit in line with Wall Street's forecasts, even as a strong U.S. dollar and lingering concernsover ""mad-cow"" disease hurt earnings. * Gold stocks rose on a flurry of interest from disenchanted stock investors.

virtue of other parties preventing legitimate level of sales by    ECTRL by 
breaching APX rules Art 12.1 etc.
   
  (b) ECTRL on its physical supply contracts (as prices on the APX are 
artificially higher than contracted supply price);
   plus

  (c) ECTRIC on swaps - ECTRIC shorted APX floating price to certain APX 
Participants whom we believe are now manipulating the APX,    causing 
artificially high prices, hence securing more profit out of the swaps.

mis-management in failing to enforce APX Rules leading to (a) damage to 
certain  Participants and / or (b) damage to APX's prospects as a main

The University of Michigan's index of consumer confidence is scheduled for release at 10:00 a.m. EDT.Fiber-optic equipment maker JDS Uniphase said it incurred a fiscal 1Q loss of $1.2 billion or $0.93 per share. CFO Anthony Muller said the company would have lost $0.03 per share if restructuring and merger related costs were excluded, matching the consensus First Call estimate. JDS Uniphase blamed a slump in demand for telecommunications equipment for its woes, but the company's CEO said he sees a ""low-point"" in demand by December or March.

it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,1,"In any event, some analysts seem to like the fact that Enron hassome discretion over the results it reports in this area. In afootnote to its 1999 financials, Enron notes that it booked ""pretaxgains from sales of merchant assets and investments totaling $756million, $628 million, and $136 million"" in 1999, 1998, and 1997.""This is an enormous earnings vehicle, which can often be called uponwhen and if market conditions require,"" notes UBS Warburg analyst RonBarone. Not everyone is so chipper. ""We are concerned they areliquidating their asset base and booking it as recurring revenue,especially in Latin America,"" says analyst Andre Meade at Commerzbank--who has a hold rating on the stock. At the least, these sorts ofhard-to-predict earnings are usually assigned a lower multiple. There are other concerns: Despite the fact that Enron has beentalking about reducing its debt, in the first nine months of 2000 itsdebt went up substantially. During this period, Enron issued a net$3.9 billion in debt, bringing its total debt up to a net $13 billionat the end of September and its debt-to-capital ratio up to 50%, vs.39% at the end of 1999. Nor does Enron make life easy for those whomeasure the health of a business by its cash flow from operations. In1999 its cash flow from operations fell from $1.6 billion theprevious year to $1.2 billion. In the first nine months of 2000, thecompany generated just $100 million in cash. (In fact, cash flowwould have been negative if not for the $410 million in tax breaks itreceived from employees' exercising their options.) But Enron says that extrapolating from its financial statements ismisleading. The fact that Enron's cash flow this year was meager, atleast when compared with earnings, was partly a result of itswholesale business. Accounting standards mandate that its assets andliabilities from its wholesale business be ""marked to market""--valued at their market price at a given moment in time. Changes inthe valuation are reported in earnings. But these earnings aren'tnecessarily cash at the instant they are recorded. Skilling says thatEnron can convert these contracts to cash anytime it chooses by""securitizing"" them, or selling them off to a financial institution.Enron then receives a ""servicing fee,"" but Skilling says that all therisks (for example, changes in the value of the assets andliabilities) are then transferred to the buyer. That's why, he says,Enron's cash flow will be up dramatically, while debt will be ""waydown, way down"" when the company publishes its full year-end results,which are due out soon.",0.5,0.5,0.8,0.3
it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,1,"NEW YORK, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Lawyers filing lawsuits against Enron Corp. on Tuesday said the restatement last week of more than four years of earnings is a clear sign the energy trader and its chief executives misled investors. At least 10 law firms are seeking class action status on behalf of plaintiffs they said were deceived by false and misleading statements or because adverse information was concealed, causing Enron's shares to be artificially inflated.""Enron restating its earnings is certainly going to help our case. It demonstrates that in their opinion their earnings were false when initially published,"" said lawyer Arthur Stock of Berger & Montague PC in Philadelphia, one of the law firms seeking class-action status. Enron declined to comment. The lawsuits name the company, Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay, former CEO Jeffrey Skilling and Andrew Fastow, a former chief financial officer, as defendants. In another blow to its damaged reputation among investors, the Houston-based company last week admitted it erred in reporting past results. It reduced its earnings from 1997 to 2000 by $591 million, or 22 percent of the amount that had previously been released on its financial statements. Earnings for the first two quarters of 2001 also were restated. Enron has garnered investor ire since it unexpectedly reduced shareholder equity by $1.2 billion in mid-October, saying off-balance sheet transactions had contributed to that and to $1 billion in charges. The company's stock plunged as almost daily developments sullied investors. It lost almost 80 percent of value from the day the company reported its first quarterly loss in more than four years on Oct. 16, to the announcement last week that rival Dynegy Inc. would buy Enron for about $9 billion in stock and the assumption of about $13 billion in debt. Enron shares closed Tuesday 75 cents higher at $9.99 on the New York Stock Exchange, far off its August 2000 high of $90.56. INCREASED TIME FRAME In the latest lawsuit to be filed against Enron since it was rocked by a U.S. regulatory probe in October, the law firm of Cauley Geller Bowman & Coates said misrepresentations and omissions by the defendants violated their duty to release accurate and truthful information on the company's finances.

Thanks very much.  I'm assuming that Bev is there in her capacity as lobbyist for Wild Goose on this one?  

Can you please let me know 1) the outcome of the meeting and 2) any actions the group intends to take.  I'm here in Sacramento, have alerted Hedy, told her that we're trying to gather more intelligence, and that you and your client are attempting to get folks together to mount opposition.  Give me a call on my cell phone to fill me in on what the group decides.

Best,

Jeff;
In response to your questions, I cannot explain why everyone missed this
bill in the past, I have raised it to the attention of my clients twice in
the last two months.  However, now that it is moving they have got the
message.  Williams (Kern River) is going to host a meeting today to create a
coalition to oppose the bill.  Bev Hansen knows where the meeting will take
place.  In addition to Williams, I understand that Questar, WSPA, and other
retail customer groups will join the coalition and oppose the bill.  My
client Wild Goose will also be listed in opposition, but they don't carry
that much clout or name recognition so far.  I am hopeful that other groups
will surface soon.

As for the bill itself, the problem is two fold.  First, the CPUC decides
what infrastructure to build at the request of the utilities.  They take
input from customers, but Loretta is a command and control type all the way,
and she will try to scare away private capital investment by interstate
pipelines by mandating that the utilities build a gold-plated
state-regulated system.  While the bill does not (and cannot legally) bar
interstate pipelines from coming into the state, it has provisions which
will prevent large customers from signing up with the interstates.  The
large customers have to commit to take firm service on a 5 year basis with
exit fees.  If they don't take this, they can only get interruptible service
from the utilities.  Many if not all large customers, especially generators
cannot afford to take partial service from an interstate and have only
interruptible access to the LDC system.  This is the same dilemma that the
RLS tariff caused.  My belief is that the obligation on the part of the
commission to provide the utilities with cost recovery for the new
investments will be used as justifi",0.0,0.0,0.8,0.6

it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,0,"Risky businessHow did Enron break into the elite Wall Street world of bankruptcy insurance?- - - - - - - - - - - -By Damien Cave, Salon.comFeb. 5, 2002 | Congressional investigations, class-action lawsuits, campaign contributions and 401K reform. Paper shredding, books cooking and wives crying for ""Today Show"" cameras. Enron's collapse has generated so many huge stories that it's been easy to miss one of the most ironic and self-revealing of all its myriad ventures. Enron, now famous for the largest corporate bankruptcy in American history, was also a big player in the relatively new market for buying and selling bankruptcy protection. Enron's whiz kids dabbled in a wide variety of high-finance maneuvers. But its presence in the market for what are technically called ""credit derivatives"" was eye-opening -- or should have been, to anyone paying attention. The credit derivative game is dominated primarily by huge banks -- just seven institutions handle 96 percent of the multibillion-dollar business. With good reason. Credit derivatives are designed to minimize risk. They are, in their simplest form, insurance policies on other assets. By buying a credit derivative, a bank, for instance, will pay another entity to assume the risk of a loan that it fears will not be paid back. If its hunch proves correct, the seller of protection will have to cover the loan. Since credit derivatives carry the potential for sudden, huge payouts, buyers rarely want to purchase credit derivatives from a risky provider. So sellers tend to be big and rich enough to handle large defaults without going bankrupt. So what was a supposed energy trader from Texas doing in a market that epitomized Wall Street? According to derivatives experts, the Houston company bluffed and cajoled its way to the table, pretending to be bigger and more stable than it really was. At the same time, it used its formidable lobbying power in Washington to ensure that federal oversight over precisely this type of market was to all practical purposes nonexistent, and then proceeded to screw it up on a vast scale.",0.0,0.0,0.8,0.2
it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,1,"Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) still hasn't come clean on the shadowy deals that led to many of the company's problems. The battered power giant restated more than three years' worth of financials Thursday because previous numbers failed to take into account complex deals with a number of affiliated entities. As a result of the restatements, annual recurring earnings in the 1997-2000 period are now 10% to 25% lower than originally reported. However, the picture could be even worse. The restatements of recurring earnings left out nearly $1 billion of losses suffered by a related entity called LJM2 in 2000 and 2001. Losses suffered by a similarly structured entity called LJM1 were factored into the restatement, while LJM2's were not. Enron didn't comment, but the press release detailing the restatements appears to argue that LJM1 was too thinly capitalized and, as such, it should always have been consolidated in Enron's core numbers. The inference, therefore, is that LJM2 losses weren't included because the entity was better capitalized than LJM1. But that explanation isn't holding water in many quarters. In fact, the exclusion of LJM2 could be a source of further controversy for Enron. Enron fell 64 cents Thursday to $8.41. Pulling a Fastow?LJM2 has received much scrutiny in recent weeks, and is primarily responsible for events that have cratered Enron stock. The entity was led by Enron's now-ousted CFO Andrew Fastow, and the Securities and Exchange Commission is looking at the transactions Enron did with LJM2. In addition, these transactions prompted a $1.2 billion reduction in Enron's equity in the third quarter. Among investors in LJM2 were Credit Suisse First Boston, Wachovia, General Electric and the Arkansas Teachers Fund, according to recent reports in The Wall Street Journal. It appears from other public documents that LJM2 could not have entered the deals that led to the losses if Enron had not agreed to issue $1.2 billion of stock. If so, the LJM2 deals weren't as arms length as Enron might want to project right now. Therefore, to get a truer picture of Enron's profitability, investors should factor the LJM2-related losses into restated numbers. The result isn't pretty: The $1 billion of LJM2-related losses would've reduced the restated recurring earnings for 2000 and 2001 by some 30%. True, a portion of these losses were included in October's initial release of third-quarter financials, but they were taken as a charge that Enron asked investors to leave out of the recurring profits number that is supposed to give investors a view of core earnings power.",1.0,0.8,0.9,0.6

RANDOM,0,"Subject: Capacity Book Status

Murphy's Law has hit us the past few days. Since migrating to production we have had the following issues on Capacity Books:

Monday the Capacity Books were not available until 9:45am.
		Problem: This was because the Group table was created on the production server and not populated with the initial data.
		Solution:   Populated table and reran cycle.

Tuesday the Capacity Books were not available until 8:20am.
Problem: This was due to an RTI improvement that triggered a duplicate record on the contracted table.
Solution:   Corrected the stored procedure and reran cycle.

Wednesday the Capacity Books were not available until 2:00pm. Due to training we held off on publishing the views on Wired.
Problem:  The database server temp log file filled up  and triggered an abend to the Capacity Books batch cycle.  A notification was triggered to Steve 	       Plant's pager at 2:00am but he never received the page. Craig Buehler  had a problem with the Price Curve Manager spreadsheet, so if 	       	       Steve would have completed the batch cycle the pricing would have been calculated incorrectly. 
Solution:    We are automating the Price Curve Manager process, which will eliminate manual intervention. We are also looking into a better scheduling 	       and notification system.

Thursday the Capacity Books were available at 4:43am with no known problems.

If you have any additional questions please feel free to contact me at 3-3186.

It's an excerpt from an analyst's noteout this AM.A Perspective: R.I.P. Enron:It took sixteen years to build Enron into a $63 billion asset powerhouse,but only 24 days for it to disintegrate.The fatal flaw was the aggressive accounting and leveraging done in variousoff balance sheet partnerships (Special Purpose Entities), which apparentlybecame too aggressive to fully disclose. Wall Street had no idea of their holdings,their leverage or their derivative exposures. The SPEs mutated intosomething beyond the pale, becoming a company within a company. This evidently began30 months ago when the new management regime (Skilling, Fastow, et al)sanctioned their evolution. Make no mistake: they were cleverly contrived. Theyinvolved conventional asset & debt transfers off the books, coupled with fair value(asset mark-to-market) accounting and synthetic equity financing. Thisallowed for considerable earnings management and the appearance of cost-free equity.If nothing else, they now appear in hindsight to have been vanity deals: veryNew Economy, very Virtual and very aggressive. But no clients ever complained,to our knowledge. Yet ENE clearly crossed the GAAP reporting lines, as thelatest 8-K attests, and the dual role of the CFO (sitting on both sides of thetable in the LJM transactions), profiting highly in the process, created in the LJMpartnership natural conflicts of interest now being investigated by the SEC.Because of this elementary mistake in any seasoned judgment, which passedmuster at every level, the most successful energy company of the 90s was vaporizedin the marketplace. The main thing that brought ENE down was hubris. It hadused up all of its credibility when the partnerships were brought to light. If thesewere fully revealed two years ago, a collapse would have been very unlikely.Rob LloydAIM Management",0.6,0.5,0.9,0.6

In November, Enron restated its results for the previous four =years, wiping out $586 million, or 20%, of its previously reported earnings=.

Williams Invites Telecom Carriers To Talk Bandwidth
Friday, April 7, 2000 04:36 PM	

		
		
	?Mail this article to a friend 	
	
	By Michael Rieke 
	HOUSTON (Dow Jones)--Following up on its February pledge to be a leader in 
developing a liquid market for telecommunications bandwidth, Williams 
Communications Group (WCG, news, msgs) will host a meeting of telecom 
carriers next week. 
	Ken Epps, senior vice president for strategic marketing for Williams 
Communications, told Dow Jones Newswires that the first objective for the 
meeting will be understanding any concerns carriers might have about a market 
for standardized trading of bandwidth. 
	That's a sensible approach for Williams Communications because the company 
wasn't impressed last May when Enron Corp. (ENE, news, msgs) suggested 
trading bandwidth as a commodity under standard terms and conditions. 
	Bandwidth is the capacity to move data on telecommunications networks. 
	Many observers thought that such a market would be ideal for Williams 
Communications. After all, 85% of its stock is owned by Williams Co. (WMB, 
news, msgs), which has been trading energy commodities like crude oil and 
natural gas for years. 
	But Williams Communications didn't get behind the idea until February when it 
told industry analysts it had formed a bandwidth trading group. The new group 
includes Sharon Crow, who had been a gas trader and risk manager with 
Williams Energy Services, a unit of Williams Co. She is now vice president of 
bandwidth trading for Williams Communications. 
	Since then, a number of other companies have said they want to play in that 
market - Dynegy Inc. (DYN, news, msgs); El Paso Energy Corp. (EPG, news, msgs

Then, I got mad, not at the man who sold me the almost worthless courses,
but at myself for jumping into something without knowing what I was doing. I
ask myself, ""What's The Difference"" between someone who trades, and
consistently makes money, and what I was doing. I found the answer pretty
simple. Like I said, it's knowledge. So, I took a year off and studied and
read everything I could lay my hands on. During this time, I found a lot of
good material and some that was so bad that the person who wrote them should
have been shot!

I started compiling information that I deemed to be reliable, that had
substance to it. What I found was a common thread among them. I started
formulating a trading plan and put that plan into action. This time, it was
completely different. I was trading and making money, and was only spending
about an hour a day at it, and some days, as little as 30 minutes.

I then had friends and relatives who saw what I was doing and they too
wanted to learn how to trade. So, I started teaching some of them how to
trade. Then, people they knew wanted to learn also, so I started teaching a
class at a local college and the rest is history.

I've written an in-depth 450 page course, designed to teach you how to
successfully trade commodities. I have students on every continent (yes,
that includes Antarctica) and in over 20 countries. I'm also doing seminars
around the world and having the time of my life doing it. My course has been
rated the #1 course on the market by my students, who collectively, have
bought probably every other course ever written.

I also have a ""Mini-Course"" which is almost 100 pages and I would like to
send it to you FREE. That's right, for free. No strings attached. This
Mini-Course"", is the first three lessons in my full course, which like I
said, is 450 pages. This will give you a very good idea of what my full
course offers. Read it at your leisure and if you like it, and I think you
will, you can order the full course at my web-site. I've had many people
write me and tell me that they learned more from this Mini-Course than from
courses they paid several hundreds of dollars for.

I will also put you on my guest list for 30 days also. You will get ongoing

2.  Ask the PX if we can substitute ""other liquid collateral acceptable to the PX. .  .in lieu of cash"" (Schedule 2, section 2.1.3).  We should ask them what else would be acceptable (a lien on Jeff Skilling's house?).

it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,0,"The fate of Enron employees' retirement accounts provides a second broad subject of inquiry. Criminal charges may still be in store for top Enron executives, who sold nearly $1 billion worth of their company stock, possibly knowing it was improperly inflated, before it plummeted. Thousands of employees were not so lucky, and lost their lifetime savings. Close to 60 percent of all employee 401(k) money was tied up in Enron stock. Congress should consider a proposal by Senator Jon Corzine to cap the percentage of employees' retirement accounts that can be held in company stock. The third issue that Congress and the S.E.C. need to address is the lack of public confidence in financial reporting. Beyond Enron's questionable behavior, the most alarming failure of all may have been that of its outside auditor, Arthur Andersen, to flag the company's dubious accounting practices. Enron is only the latest and most dramatic instance of an accounting firm's failing to protect the public from largely fictional financial reporting by a major company. The accounting industry insists it can regulate itself, but the evidence points to the contrary. Firms have placed themselves in an untenable conflict of interest by providing the same companies they audit on behalf of the public with an array of consulting services. Congress ought to pass legislation to bar such conflicts. Unsuspecting Enron employees were the most direct victims of the company's lack of forthrightness, but overall investor confidence in the integrity of the marketplace took a serious hit with Enron's demise. There are plenty of reasons for Congress to try to find out why it happened and how it can be prevented from ever happening again.",0.0,0.0,0.8,0.2

it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,1,"Egged on by a buoyant economy and the pace of value creation set by the market's best performers, over the past two decades securities analysts challenged the companies they covered to reach for unprecedented earnings growth. Too often managers collaborated in this fiction, either because they had unrealistic expectations for their companies or, worse yet, because they used analysts' expectations to set internal corporate goals. When the fiction finally became obvious the results were massive adjustments in growth projections and equity valuations, and in some cases bankruptcy and liquidation. Enron is perhaps the most dramatic example. Wisely taking advantage of a rapidly deregulating market and capitalizing on its deep knowledge of the industry, Enron had seized a powerful, but probably once-in-a-lifetime, opportunity to remake itself as a market maker in natural gas and energy.Wall Street responded to this and other genuine innovations with a series of positive reports and ever-higher valuations, eventually labeling Enron one of the best companies in the economy and comparing it to Microsoft and General Electric. However, the aggressive targets that Wall Street set for Enron's shares made the company a captive of its own success. Enron's peak valuation of $68 billion in August 2001 required the company to grow its free cash flow at 91% annually for the next six years, and then to grow at the average rate for the economy. One analyst blithely predicted that Enron would come to dominate the wholesale energy market for electricity, natural gas, coal, energy derivatives, bandwidth and energy services on three continents. Enron, to its own detriment, decided to take up the challenge. In seeking to meet expectations it expanded into markets in which it had no specific assets, expertise or experience, like broadband and even weather hedging -- and when this failed to deliver enough growth, it manipulated the information it gave to Wall Street. The story of Nortel is similar. In 1997 Nortel CEO John Roth launched a strategy to transform the company from one dependent on voice switching into one focused on data networking. Nortel acquired 19 companies between 1997 and early 2001. As its stock price soared, reaching a total capital value of $277 billion in July 2000, it came under pressure to do deals to satisfy the analysts' growth expectations. The more it did, the more it was expected to do. Ultimately, it paid over $32 billion -- using its own overvalued stock as currency -- for these companies, most of which eventually had to be sold off. Its stock has fallen by more than 99% from its peak. Some question whether the company will survive.",0.0,0.0,0.9,0.8

My preference is to resolve the NBPL issues.  Enron-Canada still needs some of the NBPL capacity permanently released to one of their producers with a another third-party designated as the agent for the contract.  Oxy and some other folks have approached me about picking up some of the ENA space.  

Please note that we were trying to get the transportation protocols approved by the Creditors Committee so that we could address (1) NBPL's insistence that the Creditor's approve everything and (2) the needs of the marketplace that once the capacity is awarded that it could be hedged without any additional Creditor approval.  I know that we are making progress on the drafts, but how quickly do you envision this issues being presented to the Creditor's Committee?

NBPL wants the capacity placed with new shippers for June 2002 business.  Ideally, this means that the new shippers should have the capacity released to them by Friday, May 24th.  This means that the capacity would have to be posted on NBPL's website by the morning of May 20th.  The schedule also assumes that the capacity release process is not stopped once it starts for Creditor's approval.

Kay, would it be OK if I called Eva and got a quick download on the results of the Tenaska complaint against NBPL that was filed with the FERC enforcement division?  Do I need to have a lawyer listen in when I make the call?

Some thoughts that might help from time to time.  This was forwarded to me, 
and I found it very compelling.

G


Maybe God wants us to meet a few wrong people before meeting the right one 
so 
that when we finally meet the right person, we will know how to be grateful 
for that gift. When the door of happiness closes, another opens, but often 
times we look so long at the closed door that we don't see the one which has 

been opened for us. The best kind of friend is the kind you can sit on a 
porch and swing with, never say a word, and then walk away feeling like it 
was the best conversation you've ever had. It's true that we don't know what 

we've got until we lose it, but it's also true that we don't know what we've 

been missing until it arrives. Giving someone all your love is never an 
assurance that they'll love you back! Don't expect love in return; just wait 

for it to grow in their heart but if it doesn't, be content it grew in 
yours. 
It takes only a minute to get a crush on someone, an hour to like someone, 
and a day to love someone, but it takes a lifetime to forget someone. Don't 
go for looks; they can deceive. Don't go for wealth; even that fades away. 
Go 
for someone who makes you smile because it takes only a smile to make a dark 

day seem bright. Find the one that makes your heart smile. There are moments 

in life when you miss someone so much that you just want to pick them from 
your dreams and hug them for real! Dream what you want to dream; go where 
you 
want to go; be what you want to be, because you have only one life and one 
chance to do all the things you want to do. May you have enough happiness to 

make you sweet, enough trials to make you strong, enough sorrow to keep you 
human, enough hope to make you happy. Always put yourself in others' shoes. 
If you feel that it hurts you, it probably hurts the other person, too. The 
happiest of people don't necessarily have the best of everything; they just 
make the most of everything that comes along their way. Happiness lies for 
those who cry, those who hurt, those who have searched, and those who have 
tried, for only they can appreciate the importance of people who have 
touched 
their lives. Love begins with a smile, grows with a kiss and ends with a 
tear. The brightest future will always be based on a forgotten past, you 
can't go on well in life until you let go of your past failures and 
heartaches. When you were born,",0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0

Frankly, I do not know what it means to assign a swap from 1 of these vehicles to another vehicle. I think that in general the schedules to the ISDAs that each of the 2 sets of parties executed are the same, but what happens in the case of differences? My rather simplistic approach would be to terminate the existing swaps in Raptor 2 and execute new swaps at the same time and on the same terms in Raptor 4.

If Anyone needs documentation on the other 3 structures, let us know....[Realizing that they are about to change due to the planned merger of Raptor 1, 2 and 4 into Mega-Raptor -- sounds like a bad Rug-Rats movie I recently had the misfortune of viewing doesn't it?] -----Original Message-----Subject: Re: assignment of trade to Raptor vehicleNo. I guess the first step is to know into which Raptor the swaps are moving and to get Joel to give us a closing book on that Raptor so we can get the correct parties etc. Attached is an assignment/assumption document I drafted for the VPP transaction which might be helpful (of course, it has a lot of inapplicable specifics) .

***********************************************************************

SECURITY OF ENERGY SUPPLY BACK ON THE EUROPEAN POLITICAL AGENDA

The tragic events of September 11 brought a new dimension to the general 
question of security--clearly energy facilities could be targets for terrorist 
attacks. Even before the attacks, high world oil prices and the euro's 
depreciation put energy security of supply back on the European political 
agenda, together with the awareness of dependence on imports, and the risk of 
economic and even physical disruption in energy supply, including natural 
disruptions from storms or flooding.

*  Security of supply, under its different forms, has returned as a political 
concern across the European Union.

*  The new liberalized environment should, at least partly, mitigate security 
supply risks.

*  Long-term risks remain a matter of discussion, with concern that market 
mechanisms provide the right signals, such as adequate investment made at the 
right time.

Subject: QSE Liability Query

Jean -- Could you please determine how (if at all) the Protocols will treat 
these specific circumstances:   When a QSE becomes unable to pay its 
obligations to the  ERCOT ISO, does the ERCOT ISO have any ability (or is 
there any guidance anywhere on whether it will have any ability) to impose 
liability on the remaining functioning QSEs to cover dollar liabilities of 
the defaulting QSE not satisfied by the defaulting QSE's credit support?  
Mike Curry said a while ago that he understood the the new CFO in ERCOT to be 
gearing up to address/resolve this issue.  For purposes of the QSE agreements 
Enron Power Marketing, Inc. is trying to complete  with customers, we are 
seeking as much information on this as possible, when and as available.  I 
understand that in California the ISO sought to impose such liabilities on 
the remaining healthy scheduling entities, which authority remains in 
dispute.  Please call Mike or me to discuss if the substance of this query if 
not clear.

 Several Republicans have sued the Davis administration to learn
the terms of specific contracts entered into by the state. On
Monday, the administration released a 67-page financial analysis,
including its most detailed disclosure about the overall costs of
state electricity contracts. Last week Republicans blocked
legislation that Mr. Davis says he needs to pass the bond issue.
The bill could come up for a vote later this week.

 ""The thing that has hindered Governor Davis the most among the
legislative ranks is the demand for secrecy over the negotiations
and the agreements that have been reached,"" said Senator Joseph L.
Dunn, a Democrat from Santa Ana and the chairman of a select
committee investigating the price spikes.

 Mr. Davis, in the interview, said there were legitimate commercial
reasons for keeping contract terms confidential.

 The political uncertainty has spilled over into the markets, where
the bonds would have to be sold. The state's credit rating, while
still solid, is slipping.

 Already companies that do business with California, like Duke, are
citing the state's creditworthiness as a reason for charging higher
prices in their dealing with the state, though the state has
stepped in as buyer since February.

 The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission recently ordered
generators to justify high prices in California this year or pay
$125 million in refunds. The companies =01* including Duke, Reliant
Energy, Dynegy Inc. and the Williams Company =01* deny any wrongdoing
and cite the state's credit situation as one reason for the high
prices.

 Mr. Priory, the Duke chairman, said that resolution of credit
issues would lead his company to drop the so-called ""credit
premium"" it now charges on power sales. As of March 7, Duke was
owed more than $100 million by the state's power managers,
documents show.

 In its confidential submission to Mr. Davis and his aides, Duke
said it would ""forgive an appropriate amount of certain
receivables, or make an appropriate payment based upon a
methodology that fairly represents its share of alleged
overcharges.""=20

 The documents do not give an amount, but Duke's 2000 annual report
shows that its wholesale energy division had written off $110
million for power sales to California that had not been collected.
(Even with that write-off, the unit's profits before taxes doubled

Iexercise the restraint to which your story pines in many of myconsulting engagements which require financial give and take betweenclient and vendor. It is simply smart business to do so. I have beenthe beneficiary of the same with my local bank when errors occurred inmy checking accounts, or when loan payments were made absent mindedlylate, etc., and the late fee forgiven. However, much of our economy,and certainly the trade of a commodity such as electricity requires theuse of markets. Nameless and faceless, they do squeeze out all theefficiencies which lead to lower prices, more innovation, and a sharingof price risk with parties who are neither the ultimate consumer nor theinitial producer. The producer and consumer get out of the riskarbitrage and leave it to others who are more skilled and monied.I find it ironic that TURN, then, is so insistent on arguing, as it hasdone on many many occasions for the relaxation of market separation inthe ISO=01,s congestion management reform. Elimination of marketseparation is nothing more than the impersonal forcing of parties toexecute trades on either side of a congested transmission path in thename of market efficiency. Lower prices for consumers. Does it reallymatter if it is done through person to person transactions, or throughmarkets?Third, your story can be used to make an alternative point. Whathappens to the merchant in town when Wal-Mart moves into the next towndown the road? All the faithful customers that your Merchant ofVengeance was protecting suddenly migrate to a competitor with greaterinventory, more choice, and lower prices. What do you say, then? Thecorollary for us is direct. The new generation owners moved literallybillions of dollars into California, at risk, and took a chance. Itpaid off. They succeeded as we all know this year, and probably willnext year, and so on. But the 3,000 MW of new power plants underconstruction in California, and the 3,000 MW under construction inArizona, and the over 16,000 MW of combined power projects inCalifornia, Arizona, and Southern Nevada that are in line for permitswill change the financial landscape in a hurry once energized. Theprices will soften, returns will be less cherry, and I really want toknow, where will today=01,s accusers be when there is a shake out?Consumers will reap that benefit, oh you best believe it.

He also said Texas will have a real challenge in trying to corral Tech QB
Kliff Kingsbury, one of the nation's top passers, and TB Ricky Williams, who
is averaging 74.5 yards per game rushing and is the Big 12's leading
receiver, averaging 10 catches per game for 95 yards.
""He's very dangerous on those short passes,"" Brown said of Williams. ""He's
completely healthy for the first time in a long time and he's one of the most
dangerous backs in the country.""
Linebackers have to do a good job on Williams or he has a big day. Since
linebacker play is not a strength on this Longhorn team, we need to hope the
Texas offense has a great day.
I think freshman LB Derrick Johnson is already the team's best linebacker,
but he didn't see any first-half action at Houston. He made an immediate
impact when he came in early in the third quarter.
Brown said Johnson and RB Cedric Benson are potentially great players, but he
said both ""have only been going to class in college for about two or three
weekis."" He said the coaches have to simplify offensive and defensive
assignments when they play because they haven't had time to learn everything
they need to know.
""Derrick is so talented and he has a real nose for the ball,"" Brown said.
""He's one of the best athletes coming out of high school that I've seen."" But
he said defensive coordinator Carl Reese ""has a pretty complicated system and
we're bringing him along as fast as we can.""
He said Johnson and Benson will see more action as the season progresses and
they learn more about their assignments.

RECRUITING NOTES: Texas still has 14 commitments. The two super linebackers
who are still uncommitted - Aaron Harris of North Mesquite and Marvin
Byrdsong of Longview - have had some changes in their list of favorites
recently. Harris had been a strong lean to Texas, but he told me today he
likes Texas, Oklahoma and Texas A&M all about the same. ""I don't really have
a favorite,"" he said. ""They're all about even."" But Byrdsong, who has a
brother at Mississippi State and who had been leaning toward the Bulldogs,
now says he really likes Texas. I think Texas can get both of them if the
Horns beat OU and A&M and if Byrdsong continues to make some progress in the
classroom. . . It looks like DT Earl Anderson of San Marcos has a good chance
to keep his Longhorn scholarship. Brown shies away from problem kids as a
rule, but Anderson, who was arrested on two misdemeanor charges last",0.0,0.0,0.5,0.2

record keeping accounting practices,1,"Subject: Rick,With the recent burst of the Internet and communications bubble in the public equity markets, I wanted to send you an email describing our position, exposure and ongoing strategy. Our aggressive use of accounting management vehicles, and early sales of positions has significantly reduced our accounting volatility and economic exposure. Hopefully, the following points will address the appropriate issues.Currently we have invested $108 million in 22 companies. Of that, approximately $80 million still has accounting exposure. The other $28 million invested has either been hedged or already written down. Our disciplined use of Fair Value accounting has allowed us to minimize accounting risk by not writing up investments simply because of improving market conditions.Specifically - Avici, Sycamore, and FastForward have generated approximately $180 million in earnings this year. DEN, Salus Media, and IAM.com have combined for $9 million in writeoffs.Recently, I have done a review of our portfolio and I believe our accounting loss exposure for 2001 is limited. Over 80% of our portfolio companies have raised enough capital to sustain them through all of 2001. So, if the markets (private and public) are closed, I do not believe these companies will risk bankruptcy during 2001. Also, our discipline of only co-investing with big partners helps assure these companies will continue to get funding.Going forward, we are making certain revisions to our strategy to take compensate for, and take advantage of, the weak markets.Limiting venture investments to technology companies that we have a competitive advantage in assessing the technology risk. Also, moving our venture effort earlier stage to take more technology risk and less market risk.We are beginning to look at other types of private equity investments. There are many public companies, whose stock prices are at 10% or less of their highs. I still believe that the fundamentals of the industries indicate that the vast majority of these companies will go bankrupt. However, there will be a select few that will survive and will end up with reduced competition and big markets. These companies will be big winners. We are carefully looking for these. I will keep you informed as this develops.If you have any other questions, please let me know.Thanks,Kevin Garland",0.3,0.2,0.7,0.2

Below are summaries of the major cases discussed at today's FERC Open Sunshine Meeting.  More detailed summaries and analysis of the attendant orders will be included in the Weekly Report next week, or may be sent out as supplemental reports as the orders are issued.


OFO Presentation and Discussion, GX01-1 [Item G-1]

In a Power Point presentation Staff discussed OFOs, citing past customer concerns that gave rise to Order 637 revisions, and recommending further remedies in the form of monitoring mechanisms (see bullets from presentation below).  

The crux of the discussion among the three Commissioners (Commissioner Massey was absent due to illness) is that FERC will monitor pipeline OFO habits proactively to look for patterns of abuse on particular systems. Such a pattern could the need for additional facilities to alleviate constraint points.

Commissioner Breathitt agreed to the approach outlined, but indicated that it would be prudent to allow Order 637 revisions time to work. She noted that the issue is and has been pipeline specific, not industry-wide.  Commissioner Brownell also clarified that, though the monitoring mechanism (through EBB postings and reports to Commission) is new, the Commission has not seen a recent pattern of abuse - the mechanism is designed to anticipate future problems.
 
Presentation bullets:

Commission's Goals

Ensure reliable service;
Minimize OFOs, maximize market forces and customer flexibility;
Give shippers information needed;
Monitor OFO abuse to identify system constrain points.

Initiatives to Achieve Goals

Order 637 to enhance market design rules;
Market monitoring;
Necessary infrastructure additions.

OFO Definition

Issued by pipelines to maintain service reliability;
Can be system-wide or limited to specific pipeline segments;
Typically restricts use for receipt/delivery points;
Requires shippers to stay in balance at tightened tolerance levels.

OFO Addressed in Order 637

Too ill defined; too large in scope;
Remains in effect too long;
Market affiliates unduly benefit;
Shippers not informed on timely manner;
Level of OFO penalties excessive.

Order 637 Remedies

Better define OFO;
Develop a continuum of emergency measures;
Timely inform shippers of OFO;
Set proper OFO penalty level and credit revenues to shippers;
Require OFO activity report.

Market Monitoring

Staff will oversee OFO activity;
Oversight will rely on EBB postings; pipeline reports, and other ",0.0,0.0,0.7,0.0

Democrats appointed to committee that will address 'open access'

The House Democratic leadership has appointed six members to the
Computer Technology Committee.  The Republicans likely will appoint
members to the committee by the end of this week or early next week, a
legislative staff member told TR.

Rep. Connie Howard (D., District 32) will chair the committee.  The
other Democratic members are Reps. Julie Hamos (District 18), Jay
Hoffman (District 112), Louis Lang (District 16), Todd Stroger (District
31), and Karen Yarbrough (District 7).

Rep. Jeffrey Schoenberg's (D., Evanston) proposed Internet Access
Enhancement Act has been referred to the committee.  (1/11/01 p.m.)  A
hearing has been scheduled for tomorrow but likely will be cancelled if
the Republican leadership has finalized its appointments.

HB 138 would require a provider of high-speed broadband Internet access
that also is a cable TV operator, or an affiliate of a high-speed
broadband Internet service provider, to allow any requesting ISP to
access its high-speed broadband services.  The access would have to be
provided at rates, terms, and conditions that are ""at least as
favorable"" as those that the broadband ISP provides to itself, an
affiliate, or any other person.

The Public Service Commission has set Aug. 1 as the deadline for the

mark to market losses,0,"The Wall Street Journal Online Stocks retreated Monday as conflict in the Middle East and a bankruptcy filing by energy giant Enron outweighed better-than-expected economic data.In late-afternoon trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 101 points, or 1%, to 9751 after trading nearly 150 points lower earlier in the day. The Dow industrials fell 22.14 points Friday. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index lost 22 points, or 1.1%, to 1908.60 after closing 2.68 points lower in the previous session. Other major indexes also declined Monday. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 9.60 to 1129.90, the Russell 2000 Index fell 2.80 to 458, and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index shed four to 575.20. Bonds turned higher in choppy trading. The dollar strengthened against the yen and the euro. Concerns over the fallout from the weekend's suicide bombings in Israel damped any beneficial effects from economic reports that exceeded Wall Street's expectations. ""The events in Israel have created a lot of uncertainty,"" said Peter Coolidge, senior equity trader at Brean Murray & Co. ""That more than counteracts any positive news on the economic front."" At least 25 people were killed over the weekend in attacks by Palestinian suicide bombers in Jerusalem and the northern Israeli port city of Haifa. On Monday, Israel fired nine missiles near Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's headquarters in Gaza City in an apparent retaliation. The violence overseas detracted from some fairly upbeat readings on the U.S. economy, including a report from the Commerce Department that consumer spending rose by a record 2.9% in October. Robust spending on cars and other big-ticket items contributed to the reading's largest jump since 1959, when the data series began. The previous record had been a 2.6% increase in September 1987. Personal income was virtually unchanged for the second month in a row, roughly in line with economists' forecasts. The Commerce Department also surprised economists by reporting a 1.9% increase in total construction spending for October. Forecasts had that figure falling by 0.5%. September construction spending was revised to show a 0.7% drop from the 0.4% decline previously reported. Meanwhile, a closely watched index of manufacturing activity rose more than expected in November. The National Association of Purchasing Management reported Monday that its purchasing managers index rose to 44.5 last month from 39.8 in October. Economists have been forecasting the PMI would rise to 42. A PMI reading of 42.7 is considered the threshold between expansion and contraction in the wider economy. So November's PMI of 44.5 suggests that the economy is growing, albeit slowly.",0.0,0.0,0.6,0.2
it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,1,"11/05/2001AFX News(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News LtdWASHINGTON (AFX) - Enron Corp in March made a 35 mln usd purchase from an entity run by a company officer, the Wall Street Journal reported. The payment appears to have been the last step in a series of transactions that allowed the company to keep hundreds of millions of dollars of debt off its balance sheet for the past three years, the newspaper said.Based in interviews with others familiar with the matter, extracts from Enron SEC filings and private partnership documents, the Enron officer involved in the transaction was Michael Kopper, a former managing director of the Enron North America unit. The entity receiving the 35 mln usd was Chewco Investments LP. It wasn't clear from the available information what form the payment took or what, if any, gain Chewco or Kopper realized. Kopper, who a company spokesman says left Enron in July, was an associate of Andrew Fastow, the company's chief financial officer until last month. They set up and subsequently ran the LJM2 Co-Investment LP private partnership, which was involved in billions of dollars of transactions with Enron, according to official filings. Enron officials, who have said repeatedly that all their actions were legal and properly disclosed, declined to discuss the 35 mln usd transaction. jms For more information and to contact AFX: www.afxnews.com and www.afxpress.comCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,1,"WHAT a tangled web was weaved by Enron. Both investors and managers seem to have been misled. ''Enron became overleveraged,'' Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive, said this week, adding that things went wrong in ways that ''I could not have ever contemplated.'' He pointed to investments that ''performed far worse than we ever could have imagined.''That was the first time that Enron had admitted it had a leverage problem, and it came only after the brutal reality had become apparent to many others. Mr. Lay says he understood what was going on, but I suspect he had left crucial details to others who have since departed and did not fully grasp the reality that was obscured by Enron's soothing financial statements. When Enron was riding high, it could easily have sold stock to raise capital that it now desperately wants. Mr. Lay and other executives sold stock, but the company did not. Just a month ago, Mr. Lay spoke enthusiastically of how great the company's continuing earnings were. The leverage was not easy to find. A lot of it was carried off Enron's balance sheet. Partnerships and special-purpose entities that Enron set up borrowed money and funneled the cash to Enron. Enron guaranteed the debt but did not have to show it on its own balance sheet because it could meet its obligations by issuing stock. As undisclosed losses built up in those entities, it became more likely they could not pay their bills, leaving Enron to do so. It is also clear that the bond rating agencies did not understand Enron's plight until the last couple of weeks. When they figured it out, it took a $1.5 billion equity infusion that is part of the Dynegy takeover to keep Enron's rating above junk level. Now Enron has a board committee investigating various transactions, and promises to release details as they are uncovered. Officials speak as if they are learning what happened for the first time, and perhaps they are. Jeffrey Skilling, Mr. Lay's protege, was Enron's chief financial engineer until he quit this summer. And Enron's chief financial officer and treasurer were ousted as Enron unraveled. Some investors would say none of that matters now, that the only important fact is that Dynegy is buying Enron anyway. Chuck Watson, Dynegy's chief executive, is convinced that Enron's energy trading business is a gem that more than justifies the price Dynegy is paying. He figures the losses from the bad investments can be contained. The big question now may be whether Mr. Watson will retain his enthusiasm after his people study Enron's trading positions. Enron has always said it hedged its big derivative positions -- positions that can contain huge leverage that does not show up on the balance sheet -- but some of that hedging was with affiliated companies. If big surprises are found, Dynegy could back out of the deal.",0.8,0.6,0.8,0.6

UDS Refinery Restart Delayed

    Ultramar Diamond Shamrock has run into problems trying to restart 
the fluid catalytic cracker at its Golden Eagle refinery near San 
Francisco following scheduled maintenance work. The catalytic cracker 
and an alkylation unit had to be closed down, contributing to a rise 
in wholesale gasoline prices in the area. A new attempt to restart 
the FCC is expected today. UDS announced in November that it had 
shutdown the FCC at the 170,000 bpd refinery for scheduled 
maintenance work and that would be followed by maintenance work on 
the hydrocracker at the same refinery. Wholesale CARB gasoline prices 
in San Francisco rose by over $0.04 per gallon yesterday.

it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,1,"es were carried from one year to the next, without showing up clearly on En=ron's books.=20The result: Enron kept those losses in reserve in case Enron had any profit= windfall on which it might pay tax, the people familiar with the matter sa=y. If it did, it would use those losses to cancel out profits, and thus low=er its tax burden. Or if Enron didn't have big profits to hide, it would ju=st roll the losses over again to the next fiscal year -- by going back to J=.P. Morgan and selling it another gas contract. Two tax experts contacted f=or this article described the technique as unusual but potentially very eff=ective. ""It certainly makes sense as a tax strategy,"" says Doug Carmichael,= a professor of accounting at New York's Baruch College.=20The whole process fed on itself. As one Wall Street banker put it, the arra=ngements ""practically guaranteed"" Enron would come back to J.P. Morgan for =more.=20What was in it for Morgan? The deals generated, over the decade, fees and i=nterest measuring as much as $100 million. In paying for future delivery of= gas to Mahonia, J.P. Morgan got the gas at a discount -- reflecting the in=terest rate Enron would have paid were it getting a straightforward loan. I=n the summer of 1999, this amounted to somewhere between 7% and 8%, or roug=hly $7 million to $8 million for every $100 million J.P. Morgan channeled t=o Enron under the Mahonia arrangement. (That revenue, of course, was offset= in part by the bank's funding costs.) The bank often got a small fee for a=rranging the financing.=20The arrangements were for years a source of pride within the bank's small c=ommodities division, which directed the trades. Dinsa Mehta, one of J.P.

Morgan for trades that wou=ld carry its losses forward. Mr. Mehta, contacted through a spokeswoman, de=clined to comment.=20In a basic way, the trading pact is a throwback. Prepaying for future deliv=ery of a commodity is known as a ""gold trade,"" because it is the way gold b=ullion has been trading for centuries. In recent years, trading companies, =whether from Houston or Wall Street, have been making more use of this stru=cture to buy and sell oil, natural gas and other commodities.

Virginia Wants FERC to Rethink RTOs

    The Virginia State Corporation Commission claims none of the existing
regional transmission organizations currently proposed for the
Mid-Atlantic and Northeast will provide significant benefits for the
state, and has told the FERC to reassess the RTO landscape. Meanwhile, on
Northeastern RTO formation, most states are urging the FERC to maintain
the status quo and focus on incorporating market standards rather than
require a single RTO to cover the entire region. The Virginia SCC says its
location, bordering the Mid-Atlantic, Southeast and Midwest, puts them in
a delicate situation in relation to the RTO question.

       ""These inflammatory statements show that judgments have been reached and the tenor of the hearing will be prosecutorial,"" wrote Silbert.
       The Senate Commerce Committee, which was to hear Lay's testimony Monday morning, met behind closed doors to discuss issuing the reluctant CEO a subpoena.
       ""We decided that we have really had no choice but to issue a subpoena to require his attendance,"" Dorgan said, ""and we will do that tomorrow at a meeting of the full committee.""
       The Enron issue ""has so many tentacles it's very hard to figure out where to stop and start,"" Dorgan said. ""There are so many questions and we wanted to start with the chairman and CEO Mr. Lay to ask him, what happened, what do you know of what happened and who is accountable and who's responsible. I regret that we weren't given that choice."" 

DIGGING FOR DETAILS
       But the hearings aren't about Lay, insisted Rep. James Greenwood, R-Pa. ""It's about the 4,000 people that ""lost their livelihoods, lost their 401(k)s,"" Greenwood told CNBC. Lay and other Enron executives ""need to step up to the microphone and say 'this is what happened, this is the good, the bad and the ugly and make a clean breast of it,"" said Greenwood, who chairs the House Oversight and Investigation Subcommittee. 
Officials speaking on condition of anonymity said the Senate Commerce Committee would convene Tuesday morning - 24 hours after Lay had been scheduled to testify on the largest bankruptcy in the nation's history. 
       But even under subpoena, a witness doesn't have to testify, but merely show up. Once before the Congress, the witness can take advantage of the Fifth Amendment, which protects from self-incrimination. 
       Other key ex-Enron employees are expected on Capitol Hill this week, including former CFO Andrew Fastow. Many of the off-the-books partnerships, in which Enron hid its massive debt from investors and Wall Street, are believed to be the brainchild of Fastow. 
       ""He (Fastow) seems to be the one with the most explaining to do,"" Greenwood said.

RANDOM,0,"template"" of March 9 goes
on: ""Duke is committed to sharing pain with state and others on a
fair and equitable basis, without admitting legal liability,
because Duke has done nothing illegal.""

 Duke says that much of its California power was sold last year on
the forward markets, not the more volatile and higher-priced spot
markets. But Mr. Priory also noted in his interview that at least
10 percent was sold for ""whatever the market price is.""

 On March 23, Duke's lawyer, at the request of Mr. Davis's legal
affairs secretary, forwarded to the governor's office additional
information about pending litigation involving Duke and its power
sales in California. The documents show that a top Duke priority is
the ""prompt suspension of state investigations, lowering of
rhetoric and stay of state litigation,"" as well as the withdrawal
of state-related claims at the federal energy commission.

 Also in March, the operators of the state's power grid told the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that wholesale electricity
prices in California were more than $6 billion above competitive
prices over the previous 10 months. Duke has questioned the
methodology of that submission and wants the claim withdrawn.

 The inquiries of concern to Duke include those being conducted by
the office of the attorney general, William Lockyer, and the
California Public Utilities Commission.=20

 Barry P. Goode, the governor's legal affairs secretary, says he
subsequently referred Duke's lawyer to the attorney general's
office. The two state agencies say that their inquiries are
continuing. Sandra Michioku, a spokeswoman for Mr. Lockyer, said,
""Our investigation is ongoing.""

 Loretta Lynch, the president of the utility commission, said in a
telephone interview yesterday, ""The public utilities commission has
not been involved in any settlement discussions with generators and
our investigations into overcharges and withholding are ongoing and
strong.""

 The Duke documents say the company should be given preferential
treatment for its conciliatory stance.

 Other generators said they were not involved in settlement
discussions with Mr. Davis.=20

customers.  But the fixed-wireless venture fell short of
expectations, Mr. Zeglis said.  ""In the third quarter, the business
went off track,"" he said.  ""This decision is as clear cut as it is
bittersweet.""

AT&T Wireless is the second major service provider to pull back
recently from the fixed wireless business.  Last week, Sprint Corp.
said it would stop taking new customers for its fixed-wireless
service but would continue serving its existing base of 52,000
subscribers (TRDaily, Oct. 18).  It wasn't clear whether WorldCom,
Inc., would follow suit.  Unlike AT&T Wireless, WorldCom's fixed
wireless unit targets businesses rather than consumers.  WorldCom
is on target to launch service in 13 markets by year-end, a
spokeswoman said.

AT&T had more than 47,000 fixed wireless customers.  Over the next
several months, they will be transferred back to the ILECs that
previously served them.  AT&T Wireless will explore using its
fixed-wireless spectrum to provide other wireless services.  Having
been unsuccessful in selling the business, AT&T Wireless will take
a $1.3 billion charge against earnings in the fourth quarter to
account for its shutdown.

The announcement about the fixed wireless unit coincided with the
release of AT&T Wireless's financial performance for the quarter
that ended Sept. 30.  Financial analysts seemed pleased by both.=20
""It was a solid quarter, which we believe is a positive in this
environment,"" said Merrill Lynch & Co.'s Linda Mutschler.

AT&T Wireless's third quarter revenue was $3.5 billion, a 25.1%
increase over the same period a year ago.  EBITDA (earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) was $718 million,
a 52.3% increase over last year.  The carrier added 748,000
subscribers, about the same as during the year-ago quarter.  Its
main weakness was churn, which was 3.1% versus 2.9% in the previous
quarter and the year-ago quarter.

Some of the churn was ""involuntary"" and resulted from extending
service to too many customers with bad credit, said Mohan Gyani,
president and co-CEO.  AT&T Wireless has eliminated some of its
less desirable distribution channels, he said.  ""We're out of the
business of attracting customers with a propensity for bad debt.""

In the fourth quarter, AT&T Wireless expects to add another 900,000
to one million new subscribers.  Full-year revenue growth is
expected to be 30%-35%, and capital expendi",0.0,0.0,0.7,0.0

Here are the main points from their conversation1. Anglelides Certain that SoCal Will Go BankruptCorroborating our line over the past four months, Anglelides stated with confidence that SoCal would go bankrupt and that ""he was surprised they hadn't already."" He noted that the only reason they haven't yet is that ""they were too stupid to ring-fence the parent"" and that ""their two biggest equity holders were screaming not to do it.""He added that the Davis/SoCal MOU is dead and that all the ""Plan B's"" are ""speculative"" at best. He also thought that SoCal was being ""naive if they thought they would get a better deal from the legislature than from the bankruptcy court.""2. Bond Issuance- $12B Not EnoughAngelides conceded that a $12B bond issue would not be enough to buy power for the summer and that the true costs would probably be $18-24B. The only reason they didn't issue more is that Angelides felt that ""$12B was all the market could handle."" The current game plan for bonds assumes an average peak price for power of $400/MWh, which Angelides said explains the difference between his estimates and the higher estimates from State Comptroller's Kathleen Connell's office.3. New Generator ConstructionAnglelides was explicit that the California Public Power Authority (authorized by the legislature last week) will ""build plants and not stop until we [California] has a 10-15% capacity cushion above expected demand. Angelides expects the state to be ""5-10% short on power all summer.""",0.0,0.0,0.9,0.0

RANDOM,0,"Subject: An interesting point in time in the CA proceeding

Here is a snapshot of what is going on right now.  It is unusual.

According to ISO, they owe us $1MM (instead of us owing them $37MM)!!!!!
However, don't take this to the bank since Jan Acton of Charles River Associates believes that the ISO made a significant ""coding"" (ie mathematical formula) error with respect to uninstructed energy, that is behind most of this shift.  On the conference call held Monday, others also noticed discrepancies in the uninstructed energy category so it is likely the ISO will discover and fix the error.
We suspect there is game playing going on (in addition to errors in the data).  CERS went from having to refund $1.2billion, to zero.  Also, significant increases (unexplained) in neutrality charges have been observed. 
ISO asserts their calculations are correct despite the suspected errors and game playing.  However, they have not taken mitigation into account for ""spot OOM"" transactions.  The magnitude of this is unknown, but could be very large.  This makes the correctness of their data even more suspect.
Obviously, given the foregoing no one can agree to limit the scope of the proceeding through a stipulation excluding settlement disputes from the proceeding.  The numbers are huge as are the shifts or swings in liability with each iteration of new ISO numbers.
Absent agreement on the stipulation, Judge Birchman is scheduled to hear oral argument and decide the issue tomorrow.
Our main concern will be to keep consideration of issues 2 and 3 (refunds and offsets) together in the procedural schedule.

I am meeting with Dan Watkiss at noon to discuss strategy, and Gary Fergus will also be coming in for the hearing.  Another conference call with the ISO regarding their data will take place at 2PM.  I will follow up with another e-mail so as to keep you posted.

     ""Lay and others would do a service by telling the American people and Enron employees and investors what happened here,'' he said he said in an interview with Bloomberg Television.
     Dorgan said he expects the commerce committee to vote tomorrow to issue the subpoena. The House Financial Services panel, heading by Louisiana Republican Representative Richard Baker, authorized the committee chairman to subpoena Lay.

Critical Comments

     Dorgan and other lawmakers criticized Lay and Enron's management on yesterday and today. Republican Senator Peter Fitzgerald, a member of the commerce committee, said the report depicts ""a gigantic Ponzi operation.'' House Energy and Commerce Committee chairman Billy Tauzin said yesterday on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' the Enron case may ``end up being security fraud.''
     Lay's attorney, Earl J. Silbert cited such comments in telling the Senate and House committees that his client wouldn't appear.
     ""These inflammatory statements show that judgments have been reached and the tenor of the hearing will be prosecutorial,'' Silbert wrote in a letter to the Senate Commerce Committee yesterday.
     Legal analysts said Lay may take the same course as David Duncan, the fired Arthur Andersen LLP partner who invoked his Fifth Amendment right not to give testimony against himself at a House panel investigating the destruction of documents in the case.
     ""They just want to put him through the ritual of maybe coming down and invoking the Fifth in person,'' said John Q. Barrett, a former prosecutor and law professor at St. John's University in New York.

Inadequate Disclosures

     Lay may have waited until the eleventh hour to cancel because ""he was trying to minimize the time people would be bashing him'' for refusing to testify, Barrett said.
     Enron's internal report said the board's audit committee shared in the blame for inadequate disclosures in Enron's public filings, along with management, Arthur Andersen LLP and the company's longtime Houston law firm, Vinson & Elkins.
     Enron lawyer Robert Bennett said the report showed a resolve to find the facts and proved that ""the board was not provided a great deal of information that it should have had.''

Subject: Brifing for German parliament members

Through my environmental work, I was contacted by a German foundation that is 
hosting several members of the German parliament on a U.S. visit.  They will 
be visiting San Francisco on April 26 and 27, and are interested in learming 
more about the California energy situation.  

Would it be possible to conduct a meeting/briefing for this delegation at our 
San Francisco office?   These are not energy experts, but legislators who are 
interested in the U.S. policy process, so the briefing would not need to be 
anything complex, and probably no more than 1 hour long.  Please let me know 
if you would be available and willing to host this group.

They are sending brief biographies of the German delegation, and more 
specific time availability on the 26th/27th, and will pass it on to you when 
I get it.

Thanks,

Jeff

Subject: contacts

Currently, we do not confirm west deals that flow 6 days or less so we have 
not had to be real difficult about contact names in deal entry.  However, 
starting February 1, we are going to confirm all next day deals in the west 
using the same criteria we do in the east - that is - deals 3 days or less 
are sent on a confirmation that does not require a signature and everthing 
else on a letter requiring a signature.  Hourly deals will not be confirmed.  
So it is very important that the traders fill in a contact name when they are 
entering deals.  The confirmation letter cannot be prepared without a contact 
name.  It stops the whole process.  We are not going to be able to put names 
in every time they do not.  

If they do not see the contact they want in the drop down list,  put the 
correctly spelled first and last name in the comment section in deal entry 
and we will add this contact to the list and it should appear the next day.

If you can help us out with this, maybe we won't have to keep asking you for 
contacts.

Litigation workpapers, which to me would include all of the pleadings, correspondence, discovery, exhibits, depositions, etc., have a six year retention. The other documents we pulled from storage but didn't produce, such as Mike McGowan's and Mary Kay's old files on take-or-pay issues, FERC orders, etc., would have different retention policies depending upon their content.2 questions :- I assume if we produced an old 3-year plan, even though it should have been destroyed long ago, it would now fall under the 6 year litigation workpaper retention policy? -Do you think documents from the first trial have to ""start over"" and be kept for another 6 years?",0.0,0.5,0.9,0.6

Feb. 4 - The major market averages finished sharply lower Monday, with the Dow industrials falling over 200 points, as a new batch of revelations about accounting standards at U.S. firms soured the mood on Wall Street.

       THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE closed Monday's session down about 220 points, or 2 percent, after finishing Friday 13 points lower at 9,907. The Nasdaq Composite Index closed down around 56 points, or 3 percent. It finished Friday 23 points lower at 1,911.
       Worrying revelations about the accounting practices of firms like Tyco International and Global Crossing revived investors' concerns about corporate bookkeeping practices Monday, sending stock prices sharply lower.
       Market analysts said Wall Street is struggling with ""Enronitis,"" the fallout from energy trading giant Enron's accounting shenanigans that led to its record bankruptcy filing last December and cast a pall over the rest of the market.
       Last week, investors sold off stocks as concern grew about accounting structures at firms like Tyco, Williams Companies and Cendant. Wall Street worried that bad accounting practices at these firms might lead to more Enron-style bankruptcies. 
       ""The Enron disease is still spreading and it's hitting more companies,"" said Ned Riley of State Street Global Advisors, speaking on CNBC. Riley added that he thinks the fallout from the Enron debacle is likely to pose a problem the stock market for some time.
       Meanwhile, in Washington the Senate Commerce Committee said it plans to issue a subpoena to compel former Enron CEO Kenneth Lay to appear before the panel. On Sunday, Lay cancelled this week's scheduled testimony because of what his attorney called an increasingly ""prosecutorial"" climate. An internal investigation issued over the weekend found Enron collapsed because of massive failures by its management, board and outside advisers. 
       The report said the conglomerate spent about $8 billion in its past three fiscal years on over 700 acquisitions that were never publicly announced. Tyco's stock price, which was crushed last week because of questions about the firm's accounting practices, fell 12 percent. 
       Also worrying Wall Street was Global Crossing's announcement that it will appoint a special committee of independent directors to conduct a review of accounting-related allegations.

MICHAEL RESING Arlington In response to the Jan. 17 front-page article ""Legislators Rush to Dump Enron Money"": Legislators who received money from Enron should establish an escrow account and place the funds there for disbursement to Enron employees swindled by the company's top executives. The top executives at Enron, and those at the Arthur Andersen accounting firm, also should have their assets frozen or placed in escrow for future redistribution to Enron employees who lost all of their invested savings in this unfortunate and criminal act. JAMES RICHEY Oxon Hill * George Will's assertion that Enron's political contributions ""bought no Washington help in Enron's crisis"" missed the point [op-ed, Jan. 17]. The real scandal is not who knew what and when as Enron's house of cards began to collapse, it is how and why that house was built in the first place. Enron's undue influence on government led Congress and industry regulators to change the rules of the game -- rules that might have protected employees and average shareholders from executive malfeasance. This is the sort of corruption that campaign reformers seek to mitigate. Still, it is surprising that Mr. Will, who blamed Enron's spectacular failure on the ""arrogance of executives,"" believes that executive arrogance is unique to Enron or that arrogance can't buy influence with money.

Fed's Greenspan Comments on `Egregious' Accounting at Enron2002-01-24 12:40 (New York) Washington, Jan. 24 (Bloomberg) -- The following are comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on accounting practices at Enron Corp. Greenspan's remarks came during the question-and-answer part of testimony to the Senate Budget Committee. ``I think that the extraordinary response to Enron is something I think is very helpful and indeed an indication that the people in this society have required that we maintain a very high standard of trustworthiness in our business operations,'' Greenspan said. ``If everybody did what is alleged in the Enron accounting system, our system could not work,'' he said. ``That is, if you have a system, a market system, it works off information. If you don't have a way to evaluate a particular asset you cannot price it and if you cannot price it you cannot get the appropriate allocation of capital in a market society.'' As to Enron's accounting practices, Greenspan said: ``I think that was an egregious act. I tried as hard as I could to find an economic reason why those affiliates were constructed the way they were. The simplest explanation was the obvious explanation: that they did not want to indicate what their true earnings position was.'' Greenspan said he would be concerned about Enron's practices harming the economy ``if there wasn't a reaction to it.'' ``But the reaction, I think, is going to create a really major rethinking by a lot of people about whether there is a spin game going on with respect to the information coming out of business into the investment community,'' he said. While ``there's been an element of that'' in the past, ``I think there's going to be a good deal less of that. The old issue of competing for reputation is going to re-emerge. And I think you're going to find at some point that there are going to be people out there who are going to say `our accounts you can rely on' and that probably will increase their price-earnings ratios.''--Michael McKee in Washington (202) 624-1895 or mmckee@bloomberg.net.

RANDOM,0,"Subject: Bammel Lease Question

I was wondering if the Bammel lease to AEP contains any operating parameters to protect the integrity of the facility.  The question arises from the fact that Bammel  had about 24 BCF of remaining capacity when Enron turned the facility over to AEP.  We believe their plan is to max inject in June which would reduce the remaining capacity to around 12 BCF.  It could become a challenge to keep injections under the remaining 12 BCF level during the reaming 4-5 months of the injection cycle.  Enron always operated the facility with the understanding that a Gas In Place volume greater than 117.5 BCF could create a high enough pressure to jeopardize the safety of the wellhead casings and some of the abandoned wells.  We would not want the Texas RRC to question the safety of the Bammel facility.  From the other end of the perspective if the Gas In Place is taken below 65 BCF their is a high probability of watering out the outer wells and the facility itself.  ",0.0,0.0,0.7,0.2
mark to market losses,0,"""I bought some early this year and added to it just recently. The bad news is probably priced into the stock, and then some,"" he says. Madison Avenue markdown Interpublic, parent of McCann Erickson, among other firms, has always suffered a bit in comparison with Omnicom, a market darling considered the class operator in the industry. But Interpublic now trades at a discounted valuation, and is briskly expanding its direct-marketing and public-relations business, which are growing faster than the traditional Madison Avenue game. Add in the fact that only a sliver of its business comes from dot.coms and that half its revenues are collected overseas, and Interpublic appears well insulated from crippling economic forces. In a more prosaic corner of the ad business sits Valassis Communications, a big coupon distributor, which produces the colorful inserts that fall out of your Sunday paper. A well-loved growth stock that pleased many a small and mid-cap fund manager in 1999, Valassis this year ran into a nettlesome combination of higher paper prices and stiffer price competition in one of its insert categories. Investors bailed out in droves, halving the stock from a high above 44 to just north of 20. Now at 25, the shares are ""absurdly cheap,"" says Greenberg, who also owns Valassis. Another fund manager points out that the company has taken control of its troubles, with hedged paper prices and a move to cut supply in products where pricing declined. Even with its growth forecast revised downward, Valassis is still expected to increase profits at a 10%-15% long-term rate, and earnings next year should rise close to 12%, to $2.50 a share. That leaves the stock at a mere 10 times next year's profits. And it's worth noting that in times of slower economic growth, coupons are among the things that companies continue to offer to bargain-hunters. With a new wave of tax selling due to bear down on haggard stocks any week now, it might feel as if the typical first-quarter rebound in the year's losers that's been documented by Lehman Brothers is hopelessly distant.",0.0,0.0,0.5,0.0

Tracking and quantifying these activities is important for several obvious reasons - to keep upper management apprised of our activities; to illustrate the value added and risk managed by our group; and to keep each other properly informed so that we can better coordinate our efforts.Currently, these activities take place on an ad-hoc manual basis, which is time-consuming and inefficient. We have a tool already in place to track our activities - the Project Tracking database in Lotus Notes. Currently this application is used primarily for RCR's, but beginning November1.2001, the Government Affairs group will use this application to track all projects and efforts - replacing the need for manual updated spreadsheets and activity quantification ""fire-drills"". The Projects have several features to allow capture of sub-sets of information, including Updates, Risk, Origination and Valuation.** Please note that this will become the only way that we'll gather this information. In other words, if you don't enter your data into Project Tracking, we won't know what you're doing! **( all other reports will be eliminated)The current Lotus Notes application will be discontinued as of October 31,2001 and will be converted to a web-based product. You'll find the web-based version as easy or even easier to use than Lotus Notes. Additionally, conversion to a new database structure will allow for more versatile report extraction.Before the conversion of the project data from Lotus Notes to Oracle, we need to do some data cleanup.

Richard Hixson, House staff and Sue  Skelton, Senate staff have requested a meeting w/ our security rep. on the 24th. I suggested a conference call, since the same individual will be the presenter on the 26th. A time has not been established for the call. The conference call would include Sue, Richard , and the House and Senate chairs of each committee, Dudley Goodlette and Ginny Brown -Waite respectively. The intent would be to brief this audience on current security practices on the pipe and initiatives we are participating in w/ other stakeholders i.e. INGAA, DOE, OPS etc... In addition, the chairs want to be aware of information we do not want to share and how to manage the committee Q and A.

 I have indicated the 26th presentation will be succinct, generic, but reassuring . We can manage the Q and A  w/ some general responses regarding our efforts w/ the Florida Law Enforcement Department and heightened state of awareness responses.

 A side item- beyond the committees interest in hearing from our security personnel, Sue has asked if  an attorney in our group could assist her in drafting language, if needed, to provide exemptions/protections to FL sunshine laws regarding security related documents. 

FYI- I have a presentation, I'll be using Monday w/ our PSC which includes bullet points on reliability and security, which should satisfy our needs for the 26th.

(The company's infamous former CEO, ""C=hainsaw"" Al Dunlap, just last month settled a shareholder suit stemming fro=m his stint at the small-appliance maker.) Sunbeam recorded the sale of gas= grills and other goods well before they left the warehouse. Many of the it=ems never did get shipped. By offering retailers deep discounts to place or=ders months before they normally would and by booking those sales immediate=ly, Dunlap was able to show escalating revenue and earnings. Eventually, th=ough, the scheme collapsed as retailers couldn't sell enough appliances eve=n at discount prices and had to cancel orders.=20The SEC warned Xerox three weeks ago about booking sales of copiers that, t=echnically, are leased, not sold. Revenue from a lease is generally reporte=d over the life of the lease, not up front. Xerox has said it will contest =the SEC on this issue.=20Some telecom companies are getting a second look, partly because more than =a few use Arthur Andersen, Enron's auditor, but also because many achieved =their once spectacular growth partly by immediately recognizing revenue fro=m long-term contracts, analysts say. Qwest has received the most attention =because its merger with US West opened the door to other accounting issues.=",0.0,0.0,0.8,0.6

While most of what we do iscontained within Enron's electronic systems, there still are times when hardcopies are made or needed for running our business. Here is how you musthandle those hard copy documents:1. The basic rule is that if you have hard copies of documents that areused in EPMI's business of selling energy in the WSCC, you must keep thosedocuments until further notice. If space becomes a problem, please contact_____ who can arrange for storage.2. What constitutes a document? In some instances you will have onecopy of a document that has your handwritten notes on it, and another copythat may be clean. For these purposes both are considered documents andboth must be saved. Similarly, if several people have copies of the samedocument, each separate copy is considered a separate document. On theother hand, if you made 10 copies for a meeting and there were 4 left overthat were never handed out or were not used, those may be recycled so longas you keep the ones that were used. If you keep handwritten notes foryour work, those would be considered documents as well. Telephone notes,charts, printouts of data, spreadsheets etc. all constitute documents. Ifyou have a question about what constitutes a document and whether it shouldbe saved, please ask Christian Yoder and Steve Hall.3. The goal and purpose of this policy is to make sure that no hardcopies of documents are discarded that are relevant to the wholesaleelectricity market litigation. If hard copy documents are discarded, at alater point in time EPMI and/or its employees will be criticized for failingto preserve documents relevant to the wholesale electricity litigation.4. Personal documents such as shopping lists, personal messages fromfriends unrelated to the energy business etc. are not covered by this policyand you may do with them as you wish.Tim, if you have questions about this policy, please call me.ThanksGary=======================================================This email message is for the sole use of the intended recipient(s) and may contain confidential and privileged information.

Here's a flash: So what? Moody's and S&P have on=e basic job--assessing risk for investors. If they couldn't penetrate Enron='s complex financial engineering, the rating agencies should have said so.==20The business press, including BusinessWeek, did no better. It celebrated Sk=illing's vision of Enron as a virtual company that could securitize anythin=g and trade it anywhere. The press blithely accepted Enron as the epitome o=f a new, post-deregulation corporate model when it should have been much mo=re aggressive in probing the company's opaque partnerships, off balance she=et maneuvers, and soaring leverage. TRAGIC. Enron's fall is made all the mo=re tragic because of the pain inflicted on its thousands of employees. Not =only are many losing their jobs, but some 12,000 are also losing most of th=eir retirement savings. In perhaps its most egregious risk-management error=, employees mostly held Enron stock in their 401(k)s, yet the company preve=nted them from selling until they reached the age of 54. People could only =watch as the stock plummeted from $89 to a dollar. Diversification, particu=larly in retirement accounts, is the cardinal rule in managing risk.

It reveals key weaknesses in the financ=ial system that must be corrected as the U.S. moves forward in the 21st cen=tury.

This requires making financial data r=eadily available and easily comprehensible.=20To restore public confidence, several steps should be taken. After accounti=ng disasters at MicroStrategy, Cendant, Lucent, Cisco, and Waste Management=, it is clear that self-regulation is not working. Conflicts of interest wi=thin auditing firms remain widespread. Investors can ignore analysts on TV =who work for investment firms. But someone has to play the role of the hone=st watchdog. Unless the Big Five auditing firms clean up their act, they wi=ll wind up with a federally chartered oversight body. It is equally clear t=hat current standard accounting rules aren't sufficient. Loopholes allowed =Enron to fool everyone, making a mockery of public disclosure.=20Regulators should also insist that corporations give their employees choice= in their 401(k)s. Some 30% of assets held in 1.5 million 401(k) plans are =in the stock of the company sponsoring the plan. This lack of diversificati=on puts too many people at risk.=20In the end, the Enron story is about a secretive corporate culture that fai=led in its primary business mission: to manage risk.

Subject:	RE: Enron Notice and Motion for Relief from Stay.DOC


A couple of points --

1.	The language in the relief indicates that we are trying to ""determine the validity and amount of PX Credits owed to EES and EEMC"".  Is this correct?  Isn't our primary goal in this complaint to (a) have the Utility return the net credit to our bills and (b) to allow for recoupment againts all non-generation related charges?

2.	Throughout the document the idea of ""T&D charges"" is used.  I assume that this is shorthand for all non-generation related charges?  We pay CTC and public purpose costs as well as T&D.

3.	Not sure if CPUC regulates the ESPs.  The filing makes this case in the first paragraph.

Thanks,

By Michael Lewis, the author of ``Liar's Poker'' and ``The New New Thing.''Berkeley, California, Dec. 20 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. is rapidly expanding the American business journalists' notion of what is possible: No story can ever again be said to be too outrageous to be true. The boss, Kenneth Lay, was a friend of the current president of these United States, an adviser to his administration and one of his biggest financial backers. The company itself was rated ``strong buy'' by analysts at almost every Wall Street firm, considered a shining example of modern accounting by reputable accounting firms, and plugged endlessly by the business press. Six years running as Fortune's most innovative company! And all the while this same operation was, at the very top, a lie. Understandably, people long for some analogy to help them grasp this situation, but really there isn't a good one. Other than failed hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management, Michael Milken's junk bond department at Drexel Burnham Lambert offers the closest parallels on Wall Street, and several people have written to me over the past week to suggest it. But it really is unfair to Milken to compare him to Lay. Alumni Will Flourish True, in both cases profitable trading businesses collapsed because their creditors came to distrust the people who ran them. And in both cases the core business -- Drexel's junk bonds and Enron's energy trading -- remain viable in the hands of other companies that banks trust. Just as the Drexel junk bond traders who didn't go to jail went to other Wall Street firms and created replicas of their former business, former Enron traders will soon be making lots of money for one-time rivals such as Dynegy Inc. and Duke Energy Corp. Well before Kenneth Lay emerges from his legal hell, the energy trading business will return to normal. But the morality of the cases are entirely different. Whatever you think of Milken's junk bond department -- and I think its sins were minor beside its achievements -- you must admit the people in it exhibited a certain honor among thieves. There was never a moment when Milken betrayed the broad interests of his traders for his own narrow ones. He paid himself huge sums of money, but he also made huge sums for his firm. He was careful to watch out for the little people who worked for him, and they loved him for it. The Enron bosses, by contrast, pillaged their firm and left the little people who worked for them holding the bag. Different Motivations",0.0,0.5,0.8,0.2

Hi Vijay

Havent spoken to you in the last couple of months.

I was in India in March for about 10 days - I was in
Delhi to see my parents (right around Holi) - I tried
hard calling you but could not get through your
number. Unfortunately I did not have your parents home
number on me. I am hoping next time I could visit you
all in Daman.

What else is going on ?  Hows job ? Hows Monika and
Kartikeye ?  What do you think about these latest
market sell offs ? (till the last couple of days)

I dont know if I gave you the latest on my end. In
March I moved back from the ecommerce group into the
energy trading. I am running the options trading for
East Power trading.  It is inherently interesting
market. The wholesale market is divided into 10 or so
hubs where you have good transmission connectivity and
it trades for time blocks like each month and further
divided into each hour.  Its the market process
extended to one end.

Hope every one is well in family.  Write me when you
get a chance.

Hi Folks!  For 3rd quarter we'll need to undergo an examination of our 
reporting requirements for WSPP and accordingly, our reporting processes.  
The filing requirements can be found under the "" WSPP Library"" heading of the 
Current Documents section of the WSPP home page (www.wspp.org).

Basically, we just need to be confident our reports are accurate and we also 
need to be cognizant that if we make significant changes, we should be able 
to anticipate the impact of those changes and send appropriate adjusting 
notification if necessary.  Let's not surprise ourselves or FERC in a big way!

I'm not sure that I am the appropriate staff to head this up, but will be 
happy to provide organization and coordination to the effort until we all are 
happy with the undertaking.

Next week after the close of this month is complete, I will structure a 
project management file on the WSPP reporting and we'll take it from there.  
Please contact me with comments, questions, complaints, x7756.

We consulted our AA folks in drafting the disclosures. It wasn't a big deal for Enron's 10Q because the positions between NNG and TW are eliminated in the consolidated statements. As for the Form 2 and the Brown Covers, there are specific GAAP disclosure requirements that we have to include on a stand-alone basis. Since most of these positions will be gone by year end, it won't look nearly as massive as it was at the end of the third quarter. In fact, if Roger Willard had given us his final word about the transactions in time, we would have booked the ultimate net transactions in September and we wouldn't have had all these gross positions. I don't feel quite as bad about not getting it right in the unaudited third quarter financials as I otherwise would, since we did review the transactions and the noteholders disclosures with AA before the 3rd quarter was released and before the noteholders reports were distributed.

producers from making extraordinarily high profits; why should this reduce 
the power supply?""
Mr. Krugman suggests that students who go beyond naive old Econ 101 learn 
that ""strictly speaking, the standard argument against price controls applies 
only to competitive industry. A price ceiling imposed on a monopolist need 
not cause a shortage; indeed, price controls on a monopolist can actually 
lead to higher output."" This happens when the guy in the top hat throws up 
his hands and says ""No point in me holding out for higher prices now that you 
clever wonks have capped them, so just come in and take what you want. And 
which way is it to the airport?""
Professor Krugman does have the good grace to note that ""That's not an 
argument you want to use too often."" In fact, the argument is dangerous 
nonsense. There is no ""monopoly"" supplier of energy to California (although 
many state politicians have called for a government takeover of the 
""commanding heights"" of electricity generation, . la Lenin). Moreover, both 
the economic and political arguments against price caps remain as valid as 
ever. Price spikes require a buyer as well as a seller. To hold down prices 
means that there will be excess demand and that constrained supply will have 
to be allocated among competing uses by politicians and bureaucrats -- as it 
was under the system of natural gas price and transportation controls that 
brought the United States to crisis back in 1977. Meanwhile, the impact of 
such essentially arbitrary controls goes well beyond their immediate skewing 
of market signals. They damage the entire investment climate by raising the 
spectre of further whimsical intervention, and by establishing an effective 
ceiling to profitability without any corresponding limits to losses, except 
for those with political pull. Professor Krugman asserts that ""generating 
capacity is being added so quickly that the industry will soon face a glut."" 
If that happens, we may be sure that Mr. Krugman will not be calling for 
price supports.
Mr. Krugman has been a leader among the baying pack that suggests that 
California's problems are all due to market ""manipulation"" by big energy 
suppliers. He concludes his display of economic obfuscation with the snide 
assertion that President Bush's ""knee-jerk ideologue"" advisers may be ""so

RANDOM,0,"Subject: RE: Annex VI

Michelle

As per your request, I took a look at this draft lawsuit.

My initial reaction is:

1) I am not aware about Enron Brazil overall strategy on Annex V and related matters (Annex VI). 
Therefore, my comments on this document may not be looking at the entire picture.  

2) I think the document needs major revisions. What calls my immediate attention is the request for an injunction to revoke Annex VI !!!. This completely undermines our entire logic to support Annex V (contract sanctity argument)

3) In the introduction, the document tries to explain how the wholesale market and a take or pay contract works. There are minor flaws which may be fixed . However, one statement is very serious. It says that energy cannot be stored. Again, this line of reasoning may defeat the technical support Annex V needs (the fact that the "" energy""  in the initial contracts, on a take or pay basis, will be ""stored""  by the generators in the reservoiers for future use. That is the only possible technical explanation a judge can understand.

4) There are some good sections, particularly when the document describes the different approaches used by the three generating companies. That is good material.

5) It is not clear to me the object of this lawsuit and which risks are we trying to mitigate. Please note that the entitlement of Annex V energies per se derive from settlement in the MAE and not on a bilateral basis. The document refers to Annex V, but then it shift gears and try to mitigate the risks of our escrow account (guarantee). What is the perceived risk? Are we planning not to pay the generating companies until we have a satisfactory outcome in the MAE- Annex V dispute? There may be an answer, but it does not transpire clearly.

I suggest you to understand and be very comfortable with strategy Elektro is taking on the subject.

Sara,

As ENA and ECT Investments, Inc., will be the entities where all trades are 
actually booked, I would not think that any new agreements would need to be 
signed between the new ""agent"" entitiy and any outside vendors (ie, brokers, 
online trading platforms, etc.)  The new entity will never take actual 
ownership of the securities.  Therefore, I would presume that the Instinet 
agreement should just be an addendum to existing documentation.  The 
Posit/ITG agreement will have to be an entirely new agreement because the 
ownership structure of ITG Europe is different than that of the States.  This 
agreement, however, should reflect exactly the same sort of 
structure/language as was used to negotiate the contract between ITG and ENA 
and ECT Investments, Inc. 

Please let me know your thoughts.

Thanks and regards,

Northwest Spot Power Prices Rise

   Spot power prices in the Pacific Northwest continued higher
yesterday amid unit outages and strong natural gas prices. A
projected weekend outage at the 1,087 MW Diablo Canyon Unit 2 nuclear
power plant and a 10-day outage at the 820 MW IPP Unit 1 coal power
plant should keep supplies scarce heading into next week. At COB,
power for today rose over $15 to $270. Power sold at Mid-Columbia for
today was up $15 at $267. Concern is mounting about the possibility
of a dry year in the Pacific Northwest, which could keep prices high
into the spring. In the Southwest, power prices declined amid lower
day-ahead demand. According to the California PX, demand  will peak
at 32,435 MW today. Palo Verde slipped $36 to $137 per MWh, while
Mead traded down $32 at $146 per MWh.

Alliance Begins Commercial Operations

    Alliance pipeline is finally ready to begin commercial shipment
of Canadian natural gas to Chicago from northern British Columbia
today and operators are already talking about expanding the system.
Originally scheduled to begin flowing in October, the delayed opening
is set for the pipeline to begin transporting today. The addition of
the $3 billion Alliance pipeline's capacity curbed price increases at
Chicago yesterday relative to spikes in the Northeast. Cold weather
headed for the East Coast triggered a 9% price jump in the region's
prices yesterday.
Prices at the New York City gate surged $0.75 per MMBtu to a record
high of $7.20, while Chicago prices were only Up $0.35 at $6.41 per
MMBtu. Canada supplies about 16% of US natural gas. Alliance is one
of two new pipelines beginning operations this week. BC Gas C$375
million Southern Crossing Pipeline from eastern British Columbia to
the West Coast began pumping 250 MMcf per day on Thursday in
competition with Westcoast Energy. For its part, the Alliance system
is seen by some as a key link in the eventual transport of Arctic
natural gas to market. BP Amoco has assumed the transportation
responsibilities of eight shippers on the pipeline whose volumes
total more than 250 MMcf per day, and plans to increase that amount.
Alliance partners include Westcoast Energy, 23.6%; Enbridge, 21.4%;

it appears that some Enron employees used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false profit-and-loss entries for the derivatives,1,"Faced with the SEC probe and a rash of shareholder lawsuits, Enron also revealed that its profit statements since 1997 aren't worth anything. The company is restating earnings through the first half of this year, mainly to reflect a $1.2-billion (U.S.) drop in shareholder equity after the company terminated complex share transactions with certain limited partnerships. The dealings had enabled Enron to grow dramatically without having to show a huge whack of debt on its balance sheet, which would have affected its ability to raise capital and hampered its rapid transformation from regional gas pipeline utility to global energy-trading powerhouse. Such transactions are common and practical. But Enron's were unusually complicated, and the company was roundly assailed for keeping the details to itself. Disclosure has never been this company's middle name. The former CEO once used a seven-letter expletive to describe an analyst who had the temerity to ask for a balance sheet during an earnings conference call. But the real stunner was that, unknown to the investing public but with the board's apparent approval, two partnerships had been set up, to considerable personal profit, by Enron's own chief financial officer, Andrew Faston. He walked the plank on Oct. 24, and the company has been scrambling ever since. Opaque accounting doesn't necessarily mean there is any skullduggery afoot. The finances of some companies are devilishly complicated, simply because of the nature of their businesses.

mark to market accounting practices,0,"LONDON -(Dow Jones)- Issues bedeviling the accounting profession for years have finally flashed into the headlines, thanks to Enron and the bursting of the Internet bubble.Unhappily, most are unlikely to be solved anytime soon. Questions of auditor independence and the use of pro forma statements are at the fore. Not far behind are ones on accounting for options and goodwill. And then there's the issue of which standards to use. Right now, ""who guards the guardians"" has leapfrogged to the top of the agenda. The Enron collapse shows that auditors need to be more independent. It's a thinly-disguised fiction that auditors are paid by and act on behalf of shareholders. Clearly, it's corporate management doing the hiring and firing of auditors. And audit itself makes little profit. Instead, accountants rely on consulting and more technical or specialized practices, like M&A, to generate fees. An accountant refusing to pass a company's results runs the risk of losing a big part of his own business. Even the risk of litigation isn't - or at least hasn't been pre-Enron - enough of a deterrent. What's the solution? Make sure companies that audit aren't swayed by conflicts of interest. Regulators should either encourage stand-alone audit firms or prohibit auditors from any other involvement with the companies they scrutinize - even if that's tricky for big international corporations, which can use all of the ""big five"" accounting firms in the course of a year's global dealings. Another dilemma is the issue of pro formas. There's a mounting consensus that pro forma statements are suspect. According to some estimates, pro forma results for S&P 500 companies during the third quarter overstated audited profits by 70%. Why should companies push their pro formas when, after all, there's a perfectly good U.S. audited accounting standard: the U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)? Enron notwithstanding, surveys show investors are more confident with U.S. corporate results than those from Europe or Japan. And yet, U.S. GAAP has its own problems. U.S. accounting is rigidly based on rules, unlike elsewhere, where it's more a case of applying broad principles. Though these rules are designed to ensure standards, they're often subverted by loopholes. U.S. companies can comply with the letter of the law but still offer a distorted picture of fundamentals. The result is that while investors are flooded with information, it's not always helpful in determining a company's value. Enron highlighted one such loophole. The company went under in large part because it was taking on huge, unseen liabilities. These liabilities weren't on the balance sheet, having been planted on special vehicles nominally independent of the firm.",0.0,0.0,0.8,0.2

US Senate Panel Chmn Calls For Enron Special Prosecutor

(Copyright (c) 2002, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- U.S. Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., called Monday for a special prosecutor to investigate what he called a ""culture of government corruption"" surrounding the influence of Enron Corp. (ENRNQ) on the Bush administration. 
Hollings characterized the extensive ties of Bush administration officials to Enron as an example of ""cash and carry"" government.
Among those with Enron ties cited by Hollings were Lawrence Lindsey, White House economic adviser; Mitch Daniels, head of the White House Office of Management and Budget, Trade Representative Robert Zoellick; Secretary of the Army Thomas White; and Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey Pitt, who as a private sector attorney, represented Arthur Andersen (X.AND), Enron's outside auditor. 
Hollings also cited Chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Pat Wood III as ""Enron's man,"" and cited Enron's lobbyist Marc Racicot, chairman of the Republican National Committee. Racicot was formerly governor of Montana. 
""I think we ought to have a special prosecutor,"" Hollings said at a press conference where the committee he chairs announced it would meet Tuesday and vote to subpoena former Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay to testify before the panel Feb. 12. 
Hollings also cited the energy policy task force, headed by Vice President Dick Cheney, as an example of Enron's influence on the administration. Cheney and administration officials were lobbying on behalf of Enron's interests in states such as California, he said, complaining that at the time Cheney wouldn't take calls from Senator Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., even as Cheney met with Enron officials at least six times.

record keeping accounting practices,0,"01/03/2002Chicago TribuneNorth Sports Final ; N3(Copyright 2002 by the Chicago Tribune)Accounting firm Andersen said Wednesday that its auditing practice responsible for checking the books of bankrupt energy trader Enron Corp. has been given a clean bill of health in a peer review by another accounting firm, but some observers criticized the findings. The review, performed by rival Big Five firm Deloitte & Touche, was part of an assessment carried out once every three years to check the quality of financial reporting of top firms.Andersen's accounting systems were ""deemed to provide reasonable assurance of compliance with professional standards,"" according to a statement from the Chicago-based firm. ""Deloitte's opinion was unmodified, without qualification,"" for the year ended Aug. 31, Andersen added. But the integrity of the process was criticized almost immediately by analysts, including professor Lynn Turner, a former Securities and Exchange Commission chief accountant and current director of the Center for Quality Financial Reporting at Colorado State University. ""If the process was really credible, I don't think we'd be having the rash of problems we are having today,"" Turner said. Turner cited reporting problems that have cost investors billions of dollars at Enron, such other Andersen clients as Waste Management Inc. and Sunbeam Corp., and similar high-profile failures at Cendant Corp., Rite Aid Corp. and MicroStrategy Inc. after audits by other accounting firms. Critics of the peer review process point to the fact that since the cooperative assessments began in 1978, no Big Five accounting firm has received a qualified opinion of its accounting procedures from a rival. When Enron filed for bankruptcy protection in December, it was Andersen's Houston office's largest client. The energy trader's collapse is the subject of a SEC investigation, lawsuits and a number of congressional probes. According to Deloitte's letter of comment, which accompanied the unqualified opinion, Andersen was told about a need to improve minor documentation and communication problems. Andersen's peer review was all but complete when it asked in November for the review to be expanded to include the Houston office responsible for auditing Enron, which had disclosed financial reporting problems that led to $1.2 billion being chopped from shareholders' equity. The assessment did not look specifically at the audit Andersen performed on Enron, because there is ""pending litigation"" over reporting problems, according to Deloitte's letter.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

record keeping accounting practices,0,"There are a number of concerns regarding data standards. According toRichard Metcalfe, ISDA Assistant Director of European Policy: ""There isconcern that, while the proposed Basle Committee rules incentivise datagathering, that is not the only issued if banks record their losses ingeneral categories when submitting internal data but do not associate losseswith enough contextual information, it we be difficult to understand thefiner gradations of risk later on - or indeed to reclassify the database toan agreed industry or regulatorystandard. Matt Kimber, a director with Arthur Andersen's financial practice,welcomes initiatives to collect internal loss data to increase the breadthof information available. However, he goes on to say that users of theinformation ""will have to be mindful of the parameters as to how theinformation is ""gathered and prepared."" Similar criticisms are also levelledat publicly disclosed external loss databases, where issues of caring andcleansing must be considered.Last month, ISDA issued a discussion paper, Operational Risk RegulatoryApproach Discussion, on operational risk capital charges. The paperhighlights concerns that a purely quantitative approach could enableinstitutions with poor operational risk management processes and controls,but with access to internal loss event data, to achieve a lower capitalcharge that institutions with stronger risk management processes but noaccess to internal loss event data. The paper also highlights fears over themethod of calculation of operational risk capital for an institution thathas recently experienced serious loss, butwhere management has reacted and strengthened the control environment inthat area, and consequently reduced the likelihood of reoccurrence.The paper, produced with the active support of over 20 ISDA member firms andfacilitated by PriceWaterhouseCoopers, sets out a series of structured andtransparent qualitative assessment criteria - with particular reference toquantitative criteria - to complement the operational risk data requirementscurrency proposed by regulators. The paper argues blat there is strongsupport in the industry for a regulatory capital assessment model thatallows institutions managing operational risk to effectively access a moreprecise means of Calculating an operational risk capital charge -institutions should benefit from more sophisticated controls and theregulatory regime should establish incentives to improve risk management andcontrols. This is consistent with proposed quantative techniques onceinternal loss data isincorporated into the operational risk capital charge calculation, as anyinstitution with an effective control environment would normally expect tohave a lower loss experience, and thus a lower capital charge.",0.0,0.0,0.7,0.2
